Aisha Yesufu, coconvener of BringBackOurGirls, BBOG, advocacy group, has reacted to the meeting between the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo and the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu. Osinbajo and the IGP had met over the controversy surrounding operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS. Recall that SARS had been under fire following the alleged killing of a young man in Ughelli, Delta State. Following the outcry over the incident, IGP had banned the Federal SARS from stop and search on Nigerian roads. The VP and the police boss had earlier met. Reacting to the meeting, Yesufu, in a series of tweets wrote: “Your people are being killed daily by terrorists while an incompetent President watches and does nothing and you cannot have empathy for those being killed by SARS while the same incompetent President does nothing. “What are you without humanity and empathy? So the Vice President can actually do something. “I thought his supporters said his hands are tied and cannot do anything other than talk like the rest of us and not like the second in command of this heartless government.”

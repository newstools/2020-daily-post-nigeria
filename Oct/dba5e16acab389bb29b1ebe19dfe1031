Manchester United goalkeeper, Sergio Romero, could leave the club on transfer deadline day, according to the UK Mirror. Everton are looking to bring a keeper in on loan, with talks proceeding over both Romero and Paulo Gazzaniga. The Blues hope to sign one of the Argentines, as negotiations continue this afternoon. Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti, is looking to provide competition for under-fire number one, Jordan Pickford. Negotiations are continuing this afternoon with both Spurs and United, although both would rather sell than loan. Romero is now third choice at United, while Spurs are also looking to sell Gazzaniga, who has slipped to third choice after they signed former England keeper Joe Hart.

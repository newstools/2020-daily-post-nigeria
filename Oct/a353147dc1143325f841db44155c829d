No fewer than seven people have been arrested in connection with the invasion of Senator Teslim Folarin’s house in Ibadan on Saturday. The lawmaker’s elder brother, Mr Yinka Folarin, told newsmen on Saturday in Ibadan. DAILY POST reports that some suspected hoodlums had on Saturday invaded Folarin’s house, carting away items worth more than N200 million. Yinka explained that the suspected hoodlums were arrested at the residence of the Senator by the Oyo State joint security task force ‘Operation Burst’. He said: “Most of the equipment had been looted before the arrival of the security men, while seven of them, identified by the residents, were arrested at the scene.” The lawmaker’s elder brother also disclosed that the looted items were meant for the eleven local government areas constituting Oyo Central Senatorial District. According to him, the empowerment programme was postponed due to the ongoing End SARS protest.

The Nigerian Navy (NN) has retired 178 naval ratings. A number of them, mostly Warrant Officers and Master Warrant Officers, had sought extension of their service years. In a letter entitled “Notification of Retirement/Discharge,” with no NHQ 03/143/16/AB/Vol. 11/, the naval authority turned down the requests. The memo dated September 7, 2020, was signed on behalf of the Chief of Naval Staff by E. E. Aneke, a Rear Admiral. It reads: “Sequel to the disapproval of your request for extension of service of your voluntary retirement/discharge from the NN after a period of 34 years and 187 days. “The NN appreciates your contributions and sacrifices in the defence of the nation accordingly. Please note that your retirement/discharge from active service takes effects from 31 Dec 2020. Consequently, you are to proceed on terminal leave 01 Oct 2020.” Nigerian Navy wished them fair wind and smooth sailing in future endeavours. But some of the affected personnel claim they still have years in service. They expressed shock about the retirement notification. A Warrant Officer told PRNigeria: “Some of us still have about a year if not more to retire but we are being denied this privilege. Even at a critical period like this, an extension of one year is usually granted but the authority just rejected this.” In reaction, a senior naval officer insisted that most of the affected officers were due for retirement in 2020. “The issue of extension in service year is not automatic but at the discretion of the Naval Headquarters which is usually based on the need of special skills,” he said.

Two men, Raji Kazeem, 33 and Ilesanmi Tosin, 37, on Thursday, appeared before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court over alleged illegal possession of a firearm. The defendants, whose addresses were unknown, are facing a charge of illegal possession of a firearm. The prosecutor, Insp Caleb Leramo, told the court that the defendants committed the offence on Sept. 29 in Ado-Ekiti. He alleged that the defendants were members of a motorcycle union, known as (Okada riders). Leramo said there was a clash between the unions and the police found a gun in the possession of the first defendant, while a bottle was found with the second defendant. He said the offence contravened Section 27 (i) of the Firearms Act 2004. The prosecutor urged the court to remand the defendants in the correctional centre pending legal advice from the office of Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). The pleas of the defendants were not taken. Counsel to the second defendant, Mr. Emmanuel Sumonu, addressed the court that his client was not found with a firearm. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Abdulhamid Lawal, ordered that the first defendant be remanded at the correctional centre pending issuance of legal advice. Lawal, in his ruling, granted the second defendant bail in the sum of N100,000 with two sureties in like sum. He adjourned the case until Oct. 5 for mention.

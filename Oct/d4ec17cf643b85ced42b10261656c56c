Paris Saint-Germain midfielder, Ander Herrera, has revealed that he would give Manchester United Executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward a hug if he sees him at the Parc des Princes when both sides clash in the Champions League group stage fixture on Tuesday. Herrera explained that he holds no ill feelings towards Woodward, despite surprisingly leaving Man United on a free transfer. Recall that the Spain international was released by Man United in the summer of 2019 before he eventually joined PSG. “My intention was not to leave the club [Man United], and I was happy there- as happy as I am nowhere,” Herrera said as quoted by Express UK on Monday. “It was not a secret. “I was negotiating for more than one year, but I expected more from the board after my third season at the club when I was player of the year. “They didn’t come to me that summer; they didn’t even call me. And that was very painful for me because I had a feeling that I was giving everything. “In saying that I have huge respect for [executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, huge respect for the board. They have always treated me fantastically. “I know they want the best for Manchester United but in football, in life and in every company in the world sometimes you don’t think the same way, and I respect that. “If I see Ed, I will give him a hug. We just had different opinions about Manchester United and, in my opinion, what the club should have done. “I want to make sure everyone understands there is nothing personal at all. That’s life. But it’s true – after the third season when I was player of the year, when I had the respect and the love from the fans, I didn’t feel that love from the club.”

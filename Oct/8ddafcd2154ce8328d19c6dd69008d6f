Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has confirmed that the club’s new signing, Thomas Partey, is desperate to make his Gunners debut in Saturday’s Premier League clash against Manchester City at Etihad. Arteta also admitted that Partey would need to make an instant impression in his first training session if he is to be selected to face Pep Guardiola’s side. The Spaniard stated this on Thursday at his pre-match press conference. Arsenal head to the match after defeating Sheffield United 2-1 in their previous Premier League fixture. “Well he [Partey] was here just yesterday, he is getting familiar with everything around the club,” Arteta was quoted by Arsenal’s official website as saying. “Today, he will have his first training session, so everything has to come really quickly for him. We knew that before we signed him that he is fit, he is very willing to start playing and we will see how he goes in the next few days. “I have seen the buzz around the place, the fans are really happy, I have seen some really positive reactions after we bought him, the same with the team, the squad and the staff. “I think he is a player we had the radar on for a long time and we have managed to bring him in, and I think he will be a really important addition to the team. ‘ “He got to know some of his team-mates [already]. Not all of them, because some are still on international duty, but we will have everyone back today, and it will be a good day for him to get to know everyone.”

Anambra State chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Basil Ejidike has said the reactivation of Onitsha Port by President Muhammadu Buhari’s government is a demonstration of love for the people of the South-East geo-political zone. Ejidike stated this in an interview on Tuesday in Awka, stressing that ensuring the Eastern Ports, especially Onitsha is viable, have been a concern for the people long before now. “Onitsha is a well known commercial hub not only in Anambra but in Southeast, Nigeria and West Africa and making the Port functional is of huge benefits to the people,” he said. He said members of the APC in Anambra now walk with their shoulders high when they reflect on programmes and projects done in the zone by the federal government “It is Buhari’s government that is doing the second Niger Bridge, reconstructing the Onitsha/Enugu and Enugu/Aba expressways among others projects and we are happy for this,” he said. Ejidike said apart from reducing pressure on the nation’s road infrastructures, reactivating the moribund ports would impact on the overall socio-economic life of the people. “This development will certainly open doors for job opportunities to our people as we as reduce the prices of goods in our markets,” he said. The APC chairman noted that he was not surprised to see the reactivation of Onitsha Port under Dr George Muoghalu as the Managing Director (MD). “Dr George Muoghalu, the present MD of National Inland Waterways Agency (NIWA) is a goal-getter. When Mr President appointed him to head NIWA I knew that something better will begin to happen in that agency,” he said. Ejidike, however, advised the business community in the South-East to ensure they make the port viable by patronizing the facility.

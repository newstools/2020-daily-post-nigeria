Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, met on Sunday. The parley was on the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and issues of police reform. Osinbajo gave details of the meeting. He said: “We reviewed several of these issues. The President and I have had discussions on this, he is very concerned about it. He wants to see a reform. “The IG of @PoliceNG has issued a statement looking at all these issues, in particular, the warning against the use of these tactical units such as SARS for purposes of doing anything other than anti-robbery. “The IG has specifically said that you cannot have a situation where SARS says they are investigating Cybercrime by arresting young men and women carrying their laptops and phones. “Cybercrime is an electronic crime. I don’t see how you can investigate that by seizing people’s phones in a taxi or in their cars.”

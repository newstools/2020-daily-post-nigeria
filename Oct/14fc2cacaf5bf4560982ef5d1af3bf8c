Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has contacted Mauricio Pochettino over the possibility of replacing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the club, the Daily Star reports. Mauricio Pochettino is back on the Red Devils’ radar thanks to his former club Tottenham. United suffered a 6-1 thrashing in the hands of Spurs on Sunday at Old Trafford. The result means Solskjaer is yet to win a game at home this season, after losing Crystal Palace in their opening fixture. Solskjaer, who led United to third place in the Premier League and the Europa League semi-final last term, has seen his side concede 11 goals in their opening three league games this campaign. It has led to Woodward making contingency plans. Woodward is not ready to sack the Norwegian during the current international break. But he is a big fan of Pochettino and senior club chiefs have made contact with the Argentine’s camp. Pochettino has been out of job since November when he was sacked by Tottenham. The 48-year-old has turned down a number of offers since, notably from Portuguese side Benfica, and has been linked with Barcelona.

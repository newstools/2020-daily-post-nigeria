The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has extended the ultimatum issued to escaped inmates to return by one week. Obaseki had initially given the fleeing inmates until Friday, October 30 to return. In a statement on Friday by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, the governor said this was the outcome of a Security Meeting held with heads of security agencies in the state today. “The extension of the ultimatum is as a result of the positive response from the prisoners, as a good number of them have since returned to the two correctional facilities. The new window is to allow more prisoners to return to the centres willingly,” the statement quoted Obaseki as saying. DAILY POST had reported that hoodlums hijacked the #EndSARS protests against police brutality to invade two correctional facilities in Benin City during the week, freeing about 2,000 prisoners in the process.

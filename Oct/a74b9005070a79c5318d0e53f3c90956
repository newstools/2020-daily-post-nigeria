The leader of INRI evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Sunday, reacted to the re-election of Rotimi Akeredolu as Governor of Ondo State. Primate Ayodele said the re-election of Akeredolu was a fulfilment of his prophecy on the governor returning to office for a second term. In a statement he forwarded to DAILY POST, the clergyman said he made a series of prophecies concerning the Ondo State election, stressing that “I started talking about it long before the party primaries in May.” According to Primate Ayodele: “The much anticipated Ondo State election took place yesterday Saturday, 10th Of October 2020 and it has seen the candidate of the All progressive Congress, Rotimi Akeredolu becoming victorious as announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC).’ Rotimi Akeredolu won the election, beating his two major opponents, Eyitayo Jegede of PDP and his deputy governor, Agboola Ajayi of ZLP. “I made it known that it is only Akeredolu that can give victory to APC and for PDP, It is only Eyitayo Jegede that can challenge Akeredolu ‘“If it is between Engr. Oyedele Ifeoluwa and Akerodolu, Oyedele Ifeoluwa that will knock Akeredolu out. If Unity Forum chooses Wale Oke, give it back to Akeredolu. “If they really want to knock out Akeredolu, they should use Ifeoluwa. If it is given to Wale Oke, APC will lose the election. “The only viable candidate PDP can produce is Eyitayo Jegede. “He is the only one that can beat all other candidates in the general election.” Recounting his prophecy, Primate Ayodele said: “Jegede has taken a wrong move and for this reason, he will lose the election to Akeredolu.

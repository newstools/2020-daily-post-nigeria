Nigerians living in the United States of America, USA, have continued the End SARS protests against the brutality, extra-judicial and bad governance in Nigeria. Nigerians are protesting in New York, Indiana, Baltimore Maryland, Columbus Ohio and some other states of America. One of the protesters in Columbus Ohio, Rasheed Rasheed in a chat with DAILY POST noted that the protest was to lend their voices to the ongoing movement in Nigeria code named End SARS. According to him, that protest is not about the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) unit of the Nigeria police, but to ask salient questions about the state of the nation. He added that the movement could give birth to a new direction and good governance in Nigeria. Rasheed said, “To us, EndSARS is not about that arm of the police alone but seen as an opportunity to ask salient questions about the state of the nation. ”It gives us the opportunity to join forces by asking for good governance in Nigeria as this will birth a new direction for the country where we will have basic infrastructure and government that will hearken to the voice of the people.”

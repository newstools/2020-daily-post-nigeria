Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has pointed fingers at his forwards for failing to convert their numerous chances, during the 1-0 defeat to Leicester City on Sunday. Jamie Vardy came off the bench to snatch all three points for the Foxes at the Emirates. The Gunners controlled the game in the first half, but they failed to put the ball in the back of the net, with Alexandre Lacazette particularly guilty of squandering good chances. Lacazette thought he had broken the deadlock when he headed past Kasper Schmeichel from a corner, but the goal was ruled out after Granit Xhaka was adjudged to have been in an offside position. “It’s very difficult to create chances against ten men behind the ball. “In those spaces we saw what they did against Manchester City. I was expecting them to do it but we had open situations where we should have finished better. “It comes down to two or three chances that you are going to have. When you have those moments you have to take them and not make mistakes at the back,” Arteta said.

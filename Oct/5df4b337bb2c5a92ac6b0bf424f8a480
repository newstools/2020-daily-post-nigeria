Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, on Sunday reacted to the dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, unit of the Nigeria Police Force, NPF. Sani rebuked the trade unions and opposition parties in Nigeria for failing to defend Nigerians. The former lawmaker who spoke with DAILY POST said trade unions and the opposition in Nigeria have shown that they are incapable of defending the rights of Nigerians. He commended youths who protested against SARS, leading to the dissolution of the police unit. According to Sani: “If you check the history of Nigeria, this is the first national uprising against the brutality of the Nigeria Police. “And for the fact that this has become effective and produced results will send a clear message to whoever is going to be part of the next security system to be conscious of the fact that you now have an awakened and conscious citizen who would stand and defend the right of all Nigerians. “The commendation should go to the voices of courage and reason who stood up and spoke out in defence of the right of Nigerians. “So the government did not just decide on its own to dissolve SARS because they found them to be criminalistics but only responded after pressure and protest that has gone nationwide. “It’s not the government that should be commended but those Nigerians who stood up. “It is, however, unfortunate that the trade unions in Nigeria have betrayed Nigerians, the opposition parties have shown to be incapable of standing up to such kind of abuses and it took individuals and civil groups to mobilise and fight what was achieved.”

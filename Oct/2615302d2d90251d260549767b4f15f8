Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has given reasons he left Paul Pogba out of his starting XI for their Champions League win at Paris Saint-Germain. Solskjaer opted for Fred and Scott McTominay behind Bruno Fernandes in midfield for their 2-1 victory. According to the Norwegian, he wanted the duo to “lay the foundation” for the side. Fernandes gave United the lead from the penalty spot, before PSG equalized thanks to Anthony Martial’s own goal. Pogba was left out of the starting XI for the second straight game, having also been benched against Newcastle, but made a big impact in his cameo against PSG. The Frenchman created more chances than any other player, as United eventually found the winner through Marcus Rashford. When asked his reason behind the Fred and McTominay starting, Solskjaer explained: “They’re in good form now, they’re good players and they played really well against Newcastle. “They laid the foundations for the win in that game, and I think they laid the foundation today as well. “Scotty played the first half as well with only one eye, that was the most impressive thing, because he lost his contact lens. So that was impressive.”

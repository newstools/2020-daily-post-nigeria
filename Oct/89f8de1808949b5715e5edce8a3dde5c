Former Minister of Aviation, Osita Chidoka has said that a poster, circulating on social media, purporting that he would run for the vice presidential position with Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal as his presidential candidate, is false. Chidoka dissociated himself from the posters, saying that he neither authorized anyone to produce them on his behalf, nor was he involved. In a statement on Wednesday by his Media Aide, Mr Ikechukwu Okafor, Chidoka said, “I did not produce any poster nor did I authorize anyone or group to produce any on my behalf.” “I did not directly or indirectly authorise anybody or group of persons to produce or circulate any posters for any campaign,” he said. Chidoka is the Special Adviser on Strategy and External Engagements to the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Uche Secondus.

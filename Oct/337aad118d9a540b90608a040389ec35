Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries has urged all pastors across Nigeria to have a moment of silence on Sunday for everyone who has unjustly been killed by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS. Suleman said this on Saturday while lending his voice to support the ongoing End SARS campaign around Nigeria. DAILY POST recalls that Nigerians across the country have been protesting the illegality and unconstitutional activities of SARS operatives. In a tweet via his Twitter handle, Suleman wrote: “Tomorrow morning before preaching, I shall be having a moment of silence for everyone who has unjustly been killed by SARS. “I advise all pastors to do the same…#EndSars.” Recall that Suleman had last week explained that SARS was a disgrace to the Nigeria Police Force, NPF, hence should be proscribed. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847501" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/suleman-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="588" height="138" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/suleman-tweet.jpg 588w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/suleman-tweet-300x70.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 588px) 100vw, 588px">

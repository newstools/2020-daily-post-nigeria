Nyesom Wike, the Rivers State Governor, has declared that members of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples Organization of Biafra, IBOP, can’t use the state to launch attacks. Wike also urged the 23 local government chairmen in the state and youths not to allow IPOB to hold demonstrations and hoist its flag within their jurisdiction in Rivers. The governor said this on Monday during a meeting with the Community Development Committees, youths leaders and council chairmen at the Government House, in Port Harcourt. In a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, Wike labelled Rivers as the most accommodating State for all Nigerians. “We can never be against any ethnic group. We can never do that. We have lived in harmony with the Ibos, the Hausas, and Edo people,” he said. “Everybody that comes to this State we have lived in harmony with. So Nigerians must commend Rivers State as a place where you’ve never had a problem between this group and that group.” “There’s one terrorist group they call IPOB. I didn’t declare them a terrorist group, the court declared them a terrorist group, not me. “The federal government declared them a terrorist group. IPOB can’t use Rivers State to be a place where they’ll be launching attacks. If you allow that, your future, your children’s future is gone,” Wike added. “Go to Oyigbo and see what they’ve done. They destroyed the court. What did the court do? See the soldiers they killed and burnt them. See the policemen they killed and burnt them and then you said people would sit and fold their arms?”

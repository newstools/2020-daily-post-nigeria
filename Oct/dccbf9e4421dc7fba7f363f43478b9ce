An End SARS protester has been killed in Surulere, Lagos. The young man dressed in a red T-shirt and black trouser gave up after efforts by young medics failed. Footage showed the medics struggling to keep him alive with drip and other equipment. Another was filmed with a bullet lodged in his thigh. Armed policemen are at strategic positions firing live rounds. It is unclear yet if Nigerian authorities gave a shoot at sight order. Todayâ€™s killing takes the number of End SARS protest deaths to at least five. The Nigerian government has been accused of trying to quell the protests.

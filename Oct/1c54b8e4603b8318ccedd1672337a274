Primate Elijah Ayodele has said that his advice ensured victory for Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the Director-General of the World Trade Organization, WTO Okonjo-Iweala was appointed the DG of the body after defeating several opponents from different countries. She also had a headway in the contest after she was unanimously endorsed by key players and stakeholders of the organisation. Ayodele had back in June made it known that the former Minister is the best candidate for the job but for her to win, All African leaders need to be united for her. He had said, “On WTO, Okonjo-Iweala can win if all African leaders come together to nominate her. “She is the most qualified, but she needs to be pushed. “If they can come to a consensus in Africa, she will be victorious.’’ And in a statement to DAILY POST on Wednesday after the announcement was made, Ayodele said, It seems his advice was paid close attention to as it was followed by nomination by all African leaders which has made her become the DG of the World trade organization.

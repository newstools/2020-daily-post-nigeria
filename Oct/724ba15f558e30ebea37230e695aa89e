The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Thursday, said President Muhammadu Buhari, lacked the political will to eradicate corruption destroying Nigeria. HURIWA made the claim while accusing the Buhari-led government of abuse of power. In a statement to mark Nigeria’s 60th Independence anniversary, the rights group said the abuse of power has led to nepotism and lopsided appointments. The statement signed by HURIWA’s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko reads partly: “We dispute the popular cliche that Nigeria is resource cursed but agree that the major challenges crippling the economic and political advancements of Nigeria are nepotism and poor governance standards. “The lack of political will by the President to eradicate corruption destroying the fabrics of governance right under his nose. “The level of abuse of power and abuse of office by the current central government has become unprecedented. “It is disturbing that officials of this administration are abusing their powers by alloting illegal employment slots to persons from their side of the country against the clear legal frameworks against nepotism and observance of Federal Character Principles. “President Muhammadu Buhari has allowed the use of the publicly funded Presidential jets for frivolous trips by the children of the politically connected, thereby increasing the costs of governance and thereby destroying the economy.”

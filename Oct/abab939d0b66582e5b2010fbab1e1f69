Edinson Cavani is edging closer to a move to Manchester United. The Uruguay striker is a free agent, after ending his seven-year spell with Paris Saint-Germain this summer. United’s top target this summer was Jadon Sancho, but they have been unable to agree a fee. It has led the Red Devils to explore alternative options with a forward high on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s shopping list. Names such as Ousmane Dembele, Lucas Ocampos and Luka Jovic were touted, but it seems as if Cavani could be the man to arrive. The 33-year-old now has three possible numbers he could wear at Old Trafford, the UK Mirror reports. Cavani could wear the number 7 shirt, which was rumoured to be reserved for Sancho. It was previously won by great names like David Beckham, Cristiano ROnaldo, George Best and Eric Cantona. Since Anthony Martial already wears the number 9 shirt, Cavani could opt for number 19. It is one of the few numbers still vacant having been given up by Marcus Rashford recently. The number 27 is also available. In the club’s history only five players have ever worn the number, the most recent being Marouane Fellaini.

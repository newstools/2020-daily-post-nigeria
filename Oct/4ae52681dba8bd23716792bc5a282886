Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has left out Mesut Ozil and Sokratis Papastathopoulos from his squad for the Europa League group-stage, the Daily Mail reports. Ozil who is the club’s highest earner on £350,000 a week, has not featured for the Gunners since March. The German has only been part of two matchday squads after football returned during the COVID-19 pandemic. Greek defender Sokratis is also yet to feature this season and the exiled pair have not been selected in Mikel Arteta’s 25-man squad. The omission comes as Arsenal renew their attempts to reach a pay-off agreement with Ozil, who has been frozen out by manager Arteta. Ozil’s current deal expires in June 2021, but he can join a new club in Europe in January 2021.

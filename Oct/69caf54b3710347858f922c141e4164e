A member of the House of Representatives, Simon Karu, has revealed that each legislator in the Green Chamber take home N9.3 million monthly. Karu represents Kaltungo/Shongom federal constituency of Gombe State. PRNigeria quoted him as saying the money covers monthly salary and office-running. Karu spoke on Thursday in Abuja at an event to mark Nigeria’s 60th anniversary. It was on the theme: “Fixing Nigeria at 60 – Sustainable and efficient democracy: Issues on accountability and transparency in governance”. The lawmaker stated that constituents’ high demand causes high spending. “The official salary of a member of the House of Representatives, which I also receive monthly, is N800,0000. The office-running cost of a member of the House of Representatives is N8.5million. Those of you who know, know that I said exactly what it is. “The problem is what the constituents demand. When you don’t meet, they call you names. Just before I walked to the stage, I received three emails from my constituents demanding money, jobs. When you don’t (meet demands), it becomes an issue.” But another serving lawmaker and Chairman, House Committee on Treaties, Osai Osai, told the audience to disregard the information. “I have never received such a salary since I came to the National Assembly and I have been in the National Assembly before him (Karu)”, he declared. In his remarks, former Senator, Dino Melaye, said citizens need to reboot Nigeria. “If you get the fight against corruption right, every other thing will be fixed.” The Kogi-born politician advocated the establishment of a National Budget Office. He expressed confidence that this would tackle the problem of budget padding. “We need a National Budget Office; Nigeria is the only country without such an office. Until we have it, budget padding will not stop”, Melaye asserted.

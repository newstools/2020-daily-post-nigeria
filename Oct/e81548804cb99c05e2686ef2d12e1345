Evicted Big Brother Naija housemate, Vee has given reason she will not be friends with Tolanbaj outside the house. Vee who was one of the finalists had considered Tolanibaj her sister in the house but had a disagreement with her over a revelation that Tolanibaj liked her love interest, Neo. Recall that Erica had revealed that Tolanibaj was interested in Neo. This caused tension in the house as Vee said she was disappointed that Tolanibaj would want to steal her man. However, after her eviction, Vee told Ebuka on Monday that she was willing to apologize to Tolanbaj for all she said about the issue. She had blamed ‘miscommunication’ for her rift with Tolanibaj. But speaking on Friday, Vee when asked who she might not have a friendship with outside the house said, ”in all honesty, it would most likely be Tolanibaj. Vee during her media rounds said, ”I feel like with everybody in general, I would be civil irrespective of who likes me or not. If something ever comes up and we have to work together I am going to have to do it, so it is best for us to be civil. ”One thing I have always stood by is I don’t know how to force friendships that is why I only had limited friends in the house. ”I don’t like to force things, judging from how the whole situation has gone from the house and things I have heard and seen, I do not think a friendship with Tolanibaj will work, so yes we will be civil.”

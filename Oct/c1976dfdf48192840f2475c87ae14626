The Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum, SMBLF, has called for an unsupervised inquiry into the killings of End SARS protesters at Lekki, Lagos State. The forum described the killings of the protesters as a state-sponsored genocide. The forum, however, expressed shock by the premeditated killings of Nigerian peaceful protesters with the kind of force that has not been used even against terrorists Boko Haram. In a joint statement issued by Chief Edwin Clark, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, Chief John Nwodo and Dr Pogu Bitrus, South-South, South-West, South-East and Middle Belt respectively, the forum said the Tuesday’s killings appeared orchestrated and fangs-baring in the most despotic manner aimed at smashing the #ENDSARS protests that have been in the order of constitutionally recognized right to protests. The forum noted that the killing was a reflection of what dictators do with ethnic militia which President Buhari has turned the security forces to in the last five years which the forum said is part of the President’s atrocities it is currently challenging in Court. The forum frowned at the killings of the unspecified number of people in state murders. It recalled that the extrajudicial killing of Mohammed Yusuf that gave rise to the violent Boko Haram that Nigeria has battled unsuccessfully for the past 10 years. The forum condemned the alleged killings of protesters in the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, describing it as an alleged state-sponsored violence including killings in other towns and cities across the country. SMBLF, however, rejected the various panels set up in different parts of the country, stressing that there is no basis to get justice under this administration as all institutions are under its armpit. The forum observed that the killing is a serious crime against humanity, saying that it must not go unpunished. It advised that all those who directly engaged in the killings must be fished out for punishment.

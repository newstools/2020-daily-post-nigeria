A former Arsenal striker, Ian Wright, has warned Manchester United forwards, Odion Ighalo and Anthony Martial that the arrival of Edinson Cavani could have a negative impact on their performances for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side in training and match-day. Wright gave the warning ahead of Manchester United’s Premier League clash against Arsenal on Sunday., He also compared Cavani’s arrival to a situation he experienced during his own career when a young Nicolas Anelka arrived at Arsenal. The former Gunners attacker believes both Ighalo and Martial could find themselves in a similar situation now they are in contention with Cavani. “I saw a picture of him [Cavani] the other day,” he said on his podcast Wrighty’s House. “As a striker, I know Anthony Martial and even Ighalo, you see him come in… your whole energy just goes somewhere – it’s not right. “I remember when Anelka came in. He was 17 and after the first two sessions of watching somebody of that calibre come in – and I know Cavani is of world class status now but Anelka watching him then – my energy changed because I knew that the end was nigh. “Now I am not saying the end is nigh for Martial and it can’t be with Cavani, with him coming in stopping the gap.”

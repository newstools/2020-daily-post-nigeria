Some aggrieved members of the Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers State have approached a Federal Court sitting in Owerri, the Imo State capital to order Ambassador Desmond Akawor and others to stop parading themselves as States Executives of the party in Rivers State. The angry members also want the Court to order the national leadership of the PDP and the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to stop recognising Akawor and others as executive officers of the PDP in Rivers State. They further prayed the court to order the national leadership of the PDP from issuing certificates to Akawor and other executives that emerged from the state congresses of the party. The matter is before Justice T.G Ringim of the Federal High Court in Owerri. The Desmond Akawor-led PDP is recognized by Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846480" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="" width="742" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-3.jpg 742w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-3-206x300.jpg 206w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-3-704x1024.jpg 704w" sizes="(max-width: 742px) 100vw, 742px"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846478" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-8-1.jpg" alt="" width="784" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-8-1.jpg 784w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-8-1-218x300.jpg 218w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-8-1-743x1024.jpg 743w" sizes="(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846479" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-4.jpg" alt="" width="775" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-4.jpg 775w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-4-215x300.jpg 215w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-4-735x1024.jpg 735w" sizes="(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px">

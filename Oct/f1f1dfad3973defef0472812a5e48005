The Federal Government has announced a new portal for the Macro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Survival Fund and Guaranteed off-take Stimulus Scheme. The website will be migrated to www.survivalfund.gov.ng effective November 1. Mariam Katagum, Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, gave the update in a statement on Saturday. Katagum cited operational challenges for the migration. “The public is further warned not to pay anything for the ongoing formalisation process or any of the package under the scheme, it is absolutely free,” she said. The fund was initiated to help MSMEs cope with the economic shock occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. The portal for registration became operational on September 21.

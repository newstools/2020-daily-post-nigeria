A commercial driver, Musibau Azeez, on Thursday petitioned an Ile-Tuntun Customary Court in Ibadan to dissolve his 15-year-old marriage because his wife, Morufat, eloped with a witch doctor. Azeez said life has not been easy since he accepted his wife back after she eloped with a witch doctor eight years ago. ”Exactly a year after her return, Morufat delivered our child. She lied to me about the affair with the witch doctor. “The witch doctor she eloped with has fortified her with so many charms that she has become a monster in my household. “In fact, I am in a great danger,” he said. His wife, Morufat in her defence denied some of the allegations levelled against her. She, however, said that her husband was irresponsible as she is forced to cheat due to neglect. “I left Azeez because he did not take good care of me and he wanted me to cater for the entire family. “The little money I returned with was only enough for me to set up a petty trade. I spent all the money feeding him and his family. Chief Henry Agbaje, the President of the court, while delivering judgement requested the couple to provide more evidence to substantiate their claims and advised them to maintain the status quo. He ordered them to produce their relatives in court and adjourned the case until Nov. 2 for judgment, NAN reports.

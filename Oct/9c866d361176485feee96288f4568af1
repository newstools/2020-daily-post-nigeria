An activist, Aisha Yesufu, has condemned the ban on End SARS protest by Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State. DAILY POST recalls that Wike in a statement by Paulinus Nsirim, the Commissioner for Information and Communications in the State, on Monday banned the End SARS protest which is to take place today, Tuesday, October 13, 2020. According to him, the decision to ban the proposed protest follows the scrapping of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad by Mohammed Adamu, the Inspector General of Police on Sunday But reacting, Aisha said someone needs to check whether Wike is okay following the governor’s decision. She tweeted, “What arrogance! Who is hyping these Governors? Someone needs to check whether @GovWike is okay. “I thought they taught constitutional law in university. How did he miss the part of the constitution allowing protest #EndSars #EndPoliceBrutalityinNigeria #SARSMUSTEND.”

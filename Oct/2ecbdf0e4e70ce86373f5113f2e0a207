Bauchi State Deputy Governor, Senator Baba Tela, on Saturday said despite the dwindling resources, occasioned by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the state government conducted local government elections to prove the administration’s critics wrong. Senator Tela stated this while speaking with journalists at the headquarters of Katagum Local Government Area of the state, after he voted in the elections. According to Senator Tela, conducting free and fair council polls was one of the promises made to the people of Bauchi State by Senator Bala AbdulKadir-led People’s Democratic Party administration in the state. He added that by keeping its promise with the eventual conduct of the elections, both critics of the administration and doubting Thomases have been permanently silenced. “We are very happy that at least, we are fulfilling our campaign promises (to the people of the state). The people have been allowed to exercise their franchise rights in these elections,” the deputy governor said. He commended the electorate across the state for turning up to perform their civic rights by voting in the elections and their peaceful conducts. Meanwhile, Tela stated that the Governor Mohammed-led administration in the state has been able to do a lot for the people in terms of executing people-oriental developmental policies, programmes and projects in the state since its inception. He added that in view of the dwindling revenues accruing to the state government from the federation account, the government, apart from managing the little at hand is also looking onto development partners to support the state to carry out more developmental projects in the area of water supply, health, education, agriculture and in others crucial sectors

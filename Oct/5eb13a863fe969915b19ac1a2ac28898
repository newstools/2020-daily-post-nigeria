The mysterious discovery of a camera at the Lekki toll gate by the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola is generating reactions on social media. Fashola is currently the third most trending topic on Twitter, as Nigerians mocked what many described as “forensic Fashola.” On Sunday, the former Governor of Lagos state led the federal government delegation to sympathize with the government of Lagos. Following a visit to the Lekki toll gate, a hidden camera was found the Minister who picked it up, apparently for further investigation. But reacting to the news, a handle, @elcroxificio tweeted: “I had second hand embarrassment for Babatunde Raji Fashola last night. APC turned my favorite person in the entire party to a moron in the name of pulling Sherlock Holmes.
I mean, that toll gate was cleaned by Lawma, and even Arise TV has a clip where ‘iron condemn’ cleared up. “How in God’s thunderous name did you all find a camera that expensive lying around??? Christ! I honestly type in shame! And look forward to the laughable clip the party is going to release in the coming days.” Also tweeting with @nedunaija, a tweet reads, “The Nigerian state is totally ridiculous in its modus operandi. ”Fashola finished making a comment that resonated with me, and then stepped out to go discover hidden camera at the scene of major crime. ”The confidence these people have in our presumed stupidity baffles me.” Hip Hop artist, Iceprince Zamani also expressed disappointment in what many have described as a stunt by the Minister. “Somebody pls tell me the Minister, Fashola and his guys running into a random camcorder at Lekki toll gate yesterday was a joke !!! Pls I’m begging anyone… Just say it’s a joke, That lawma just cleaned the whole place up and Jide already did a tour!?”

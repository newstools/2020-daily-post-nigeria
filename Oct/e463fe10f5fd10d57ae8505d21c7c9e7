Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries has said that David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido, displayed the diplomacy of a 72-year-old man during his meeting with the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu on Monday. Suleman said this while reacting to Davido’s denial of being part of the Nigerians that participated in the protest, calling for the end of the Special Anti Robbery Squad, SARS, protest in Abuja. Davido, who was seen at the protest ground on Sunday in Abuja, disclosed that he was in the nation’s capital because of his fans and he came to the protest venue to calm things down. The 27-year-old musician had insisted that he wanted an open-door meeting, but the IGP said, “How can you come here for a close-door meeting when you were protesting yesterday, and you identified with the protesters? Davido responded, “I didn’t protest. I was not there to protest. I was there to calm things down because the protesters are my fans.” However, Adamu maintained that Davido had taken an action that projected him as playing a true voice for young people, adding that the agenda of the meeting needed to be streamlined. DAILY POST recall that Adamu on Sunday, announced the disbandment of SARS, following days of online and offline protests. Reacting, Suleman in a tweet applauded Davido for displaying wisdom at the IGP’s office. Suleman tweeted on Monday,” What @davido did yesterday took courage..what he did today took wisdom…he might be 27yrs of age, but he displayed the diplomacy of a 72yr old…he shouldn’t be condemned.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847989" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/suleman1.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="134" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/suleman1.jpg 573w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/suleman1-300x70.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px">

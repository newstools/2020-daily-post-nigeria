The Manchester United squad have travelled to Paris without Edinson Cavani, Harry Maguire, Jesse Lingard and Eric Bailly. They will all miss their first Champions League group game against Paris Saint-Germain. Maguire, Greenwood, Bailly and Lingard are injured, while Cavani is not fit enough to play. Bruno Fernandes will skipper United in the absence of Maguire. United manager Solskjaer said on Monday: “We hope the players won’t be away for too long. Edinson needs a few more days training before we can think about the weekend. “Hopefully the same with Harry, Eric and Mason as well, but we’re not sure about that.”

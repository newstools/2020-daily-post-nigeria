Former Imo State governor, Rochas Okorocha has said that the End SARS protest was not just targeted at the police but also a wake-up call to Nigerian elites to end years of bad leadership, joblessness and poverty in the country. Speaking with newsmen in Abuja on Saturday, the senator representing Imo West senatorial district, called on every political elite to sacrifice part of their salaries and allowances as a way of curbing the sufferings of the youths. According to him, their lifestyles provoked ordinary Nigerians, adding that the genuine protest was a wake-up call to the political elite to live up to their responsibilities. “What started a few days ago as a peaceful protest escalated into violent one with many souls lost and properties burnt. “This situation is very unfortunate and highly regrettable one. I want to sympathize with those that have lost their loved one’s due to the protests. “However, I want to say that this is a wake-up call by the youths of this country to the leaders of this nation. “It is also a proof that we the elite have been selfish in handling the affairs of this country. There has been a track record of unfair leadership for a long time. “The End SARS protest is not just targeted at police but a disappointment over economic issues in a nation where we have joblessness and poverty for the youths. “Today, we have millions of out of school children in the country, and this is another time bomb for tomorrow. “The government and leaders must rise to their responsibilities to ensure that such future occurrences do not happen again.”

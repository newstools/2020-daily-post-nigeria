Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has condemned the brutalization of protesters calling for the end of police harassment in the country. Atiku in a tweet on Friday commended Nigerian youths for staying out on the streets to make their voices heard. The PDP Chieftain who said protests are part of democracy called on the Buhari led administration to ensure that the youths are heard. “I woke up to the peaceful #EndSARSProtests going on in Lagos and other cities in the country. “First, I would like to commend the tenacity of our brave youths who have stayed out on the streets all day and night to make their voices heard. I stand with you all. “Protests are an essential part of any democracy as we have seen the world over, and should be seen as an opportunity for dialogue between our people and our leaders. “Thus, it is essential that the fundamental rights of Nigerians to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression must be protected at all costs. “I strongly condemn any disproportionate use of force on protesters across the nation. I also call on the relevant authorities to ensure our youths are heard, and all incidents of excessive use of force by security agencies against protesters are investigated”

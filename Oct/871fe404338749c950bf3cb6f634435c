Advising the singer against the protest, the minister said the federal government was determined to tackle the issue. In a tweet, the minister wrote: “I urge you and other youth not to embark upon any protest. Your grievances are being addressed at the highest level of government. “As the Minister in charge of youth I know this is an issue that must be tackled. Government is doing just that.”

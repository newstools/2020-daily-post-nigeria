The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised President Muhammadu Buhari not to renege on his resolve not to interfere in elections, especially the October 10 governorship election in Ondo State. The PDP National spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, made the call at a press conference on Sunday in Abuja. Ologbondiyan called on Buhari not to succumb to the pressure of those plotting to use violence and ‘federal might’ to muscle the Ondo governorship election against the wishes and aspirations of the people of the state. He said: “Our campaign, therefore, calls on Buhari not to succumb to pressure by Akeredolu and the APC to renege in his resolve not to interfere in elections, as amply witnessed in the September 19 Edo election. “We invite Mr President to note the applause and commendations coming to him from all parts of our nation and the global community over the non-interference of his Presidency in the conduct of Edo State election. “For allowing a free, fair and credible election in Edo State, a development that allowed the will of the people to prevail. “Mr President must not allow Akeredolu, who had been justly rejected by his people for non-performance and who has declared his citizens as his “enemies for life”, to detract from his desire in this regard. “Our campaign, therefore, urges President Buhari to adopt the same Edo stance to ensure a free, fair and credible election in Ondo State, without regard to partisan consideration. “This’s important so that he can leave a legacy of electoral uprightness for which posterity and history can be kind to him. “We make this demand because it’s clear that the tide favours Eyitayo Jegede in this election.”

Manchester United have agreed to pay Edinson Cavani £20million to move to Old Trafford, the UK Mirror reports. United opened talks with the 33-year-old striker this week, after deciding not to meet the £107million asking price Borussia Dortmund demanded for Jadon Sancho. Cavani is a free agent after leaving Paris Saint-Germain this summer. Negotiations has gone well and Cavani is now expected to sign a two-year contract worth £200,000-a-week. He will become Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s second signing after Donny van de Beek. United’s swoop for Cavani comes with the club growing increasingly desperate to add quality to the team.

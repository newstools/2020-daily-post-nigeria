The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has again denied the responsibility for the shooting of peaceful End SARS protesters on Tuesday, October 20. Uniformed men opened fire on scores of protesters at the Lekki toll gate, as they sat and sang the national anthem. Many were killed, with others badly injured. A lot of people have also been declared missing since the tragic event. In a statement on Sunday, Tinubu said “Here, let me directly address the sharp point aimed against me. I have been falsely accused of ordering the reported deployment of soldiers against peaceful protesters that took place at Lekki on 20 October 2020. “This allegation is a complete and terrible lie. I did not order this or any assault against anybody. I would never want such a vile thing to happen nor did I have any prior knowledge about this sad event. “It is my firm belief that no one should be harassed, injured or possibly killed for doing what they have the constitutional right to do in making their contribution to a better, more equitable society. “As a political figure, I am accustomed to people attributing to me all manner of indiscretions of which I have no knowledge and in which I played no role. I have usually ignored such falsities as the cost of being in the public eye. “This time, it is different. The allegation now levied against me is that I called on soldiers to kill my own people. This allegation is the foulest of lies. “The use of strong force against any peaceful protesters is indefensible, completely outside the norms of a democratic society and progressive political culture to which I aspire and have devoted my public life.” Tinubu further claimed that “For various reasons, I became the most available scapegoat. “Some people don’t like me because they believe the false rumours uttered about me over the years. Some maligned my name because they hide ulterior motives and harbour unrequited political scores they intend to settle.”

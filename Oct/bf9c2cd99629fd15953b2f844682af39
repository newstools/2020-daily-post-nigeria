Nigerians are openly planning relocation from the country after President Muhammadu Buhari’s speech. The president Thursday night addressed the nation. His broadcast, described as lacklustre, followed widespread violence that erupted after End SARS protests went awry. Unimpressed by the speech, many social media users have declared their intention to exit Nigeria. The president is under fire for not mentioning the Lagos shootings by the military. The operation against peaceful protesters who camped at the Lekki Toll Gate sparked global outrage. International bodies and world powers, including the United States, have demanded prosecution of the security personnel. A number of Twitter and Facebook users say it is time for them to leave, citing Buhari’s style of leadership. They are condemning government actions and inactions, insisting that the best option is emigration. “Passport. Transcript. Winter Jacket. Get out if you can and go get international education, exposure, experience. Come back later if you want or contribute to Nigeria from abroad”, Dipi Awojide tweeted. “Hello Fine men on the TL, if you have a British, Canadian or American passport and you’re looking for a wife, I’m available for marriage. I can submit my CV in your dm”, @airlah wrote. “Who dey travel go Canada tomorrow? Abeg come lap me”, Samuel Mbah wrote. “Young men with foreign citizenship Abeg my dm is open. I’m ready for marriage”, @foliskoko stated. “Just remembering that British-passport holding Igbo boy who used to match his trousers to his shoes, that wanted to marry me. It’s someone that is alive that can be a fashion critic”, Onyebuchi Ajufo said. “I want to travel too please. Who has any help they can render?! Even if it is for us to marry, it’s small in the works of the Lord. I would be a good wife please. Help my life”, @Thecheftami appealed.

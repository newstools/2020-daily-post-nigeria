The Osun State government on Thursday returned some looted items to persons who have identified their properties. Recall that the 72-hour amnesty granted the looters to return the stolen items ended on Wednesday and some of the looted materials have been returned. Some owners identified their properties at the state government house, Osogbo, where the recovered loots were deposited. The Executive Secretary, Osun Health Insurance Scheme, OHIS, Dr Adeniyi Oginni, told newsmen that he has identified fifteen percent of the stolen properties of OHIS. He expressed sadness that many properties of the scheme were also vandalized during the attack on Saturday. Oginni described the 72-hour amnesty as a very critical factor in the recovery of the stolen items. ”It was like a malicious attack on the agency. Apart from the things that were carted away, many things were vandalized. ”About fifteen percent have been recovered. Though, some of the electronics like flat TV have spoilt. There is a very critical aspect of our properties that have not been recovered. Our server, all our computers (both desktops and laptops). We have not seen any one of them. “We are appealing to the residents of the state to quickly notify the law enforcement agents whenever they see anybody trying to sell electronics equipment. Speaking on behalf of the Senator representing Osun Central, Dr. Ajibola Bashiru, one of his aides, Bisi Babalola, confirmed that some of the properties carted away in the Senator’s house have been identified. He said about forty-five percent of the motorcycles, deep freezers and sewing machines have been identified among the returned loots.

One person has been reported dead in a clash between some rival young guys in Agosasa, Ipokia Local Government area of Ogun State, DAILY POST reports. The deceased man, who was identified as Alari David, was allegedly stabbed to death by three brothers and their friend on Thursday. Locals identified the suspects as Umar Musa, Taiwo Musa, Kehinde Musa and Kehinde Oyajinmi. Our correspondent gathered that the crisis started on Wednesday evening when David was first attacked by his alleged killers during a brawl. On Thursday, David was said to have gone to the Musas’ house to report the incident to their parents. An indigene of Agosasa, who did not want to be named, disclosed that another crisis ensued when David got to his attackers’ house without meeting their parents at home. “They stabbed the boy on Tuesday and he went to their house with his friends to report those that stabbed him to their parents. “Getting there, they didn’t meet the parents but they met the guys with knives,” the source said. It was gathered that another fight broke out and “the boys attacked David again, stabbing him in the chest.” “He was immediately rushed to Olutunu Hospital in Agosasa, but he died at the gate of the hospital,” the source disclosed. Another source revealed that David’s friends, who were infuriated by his killing, set the suspected stabbers’ parents’ house on fire, causing serious mayhem in the ancient Ogun Community. Our correspondent learnt that it took the intervention of the traditional institution in Agosasa to restore peace. As of Friday, the three brothers and their friends are yet to be arrested as they fled the town immediately, a police source, who pleaded anonymity, told DAILY POST. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, said he had not been briefed about the incident, promising to revert.

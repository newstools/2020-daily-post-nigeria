Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has criticized his players for not being mentally strong, following their 3-3 draw with West Ham on Sunday. Harry Kane scored twice and provided another for Heung-Min Son, as Spurs raced into a three-goal lead in the first half. However, Mourinho’s men threw away their advantage to draw 3-3. Fabian Balbuena, a Davinson Sanchez own goal and a stunner from Manuel Lanzini saw Tottenham drop points. “[In the second half] the team was dropping. With [Harry] Winks we found balance again and was in control. It was exactly when we were in control that we conceded the first and their belief went up. My guys were not strong enough to cope with it psychologically. The last few seconds we lost two points.” He continued to BBC Sport: “We should be stronger. In the second half they risked quite a lot, pressing up and gave us more space. We should get an occasion to win the game. “I don’t know if it was us inviting them or with them with the extra motivation of getting in the game. I can’t identify us or them, maybe both.”

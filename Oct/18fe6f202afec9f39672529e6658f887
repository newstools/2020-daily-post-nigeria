The Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) has advised the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to stay action on the implementation of Special Weapons and Tactics Team (SWAT). Adamu had announced that the new team will replace the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The unit was disbanded due its excesses over the years. The Governors, in a communique on Thursday, said they held a meeting with Adamu on the formation. Adamu briefed the state chief executives on the protests against SARS. The communique signed by NGF Chairman and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, hailed the plan for far-reaching reforms for accountability, greater effectiveness, and transparency. The governors, however, stressed that there was a need for greater consultation with the public. They advised Adamu to “convene a meeting of all stakeholders and agree on a format of engagement with state officials”. The governors warned that the mood of Nigerians should be considered. They said SWAT implementation may be seen as an attempt to simply rebrand SARS. The communique disclosed that Adamu told them that after a psychological and medical evaluation, 50 SWAT Officers will be trained and posted to all State Commands. He assured that they will not take part in routine operations, operate specifically on intelligence and return to their commands. “The IGP assured Governors that he will leverage the provisions of the new Police Act 2020 to carry out extensive reforms within the Police and he pledged for the support, understanding and guidance of Governors to embark on the new reforms”, it read. The governors urged the police to fish out rogue members of the disbanded police unit and ensure that they are investigated and prosecuted.

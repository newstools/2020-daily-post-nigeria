Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has provided the latest update on Kevin de Bruyne, Sergio Aguero and Gabriel Jesus ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Arsenal on Saturday. Guardiola says De Bruyne will not feature against Arsenal due to injury. According to him, Aguero is training well, and the Argentine striker is back on the pitch after a long time, while Jesus has an injury in the front part of his leg. Guardiola’s men head to the game after a 1-1 draw with Leeds United in their previous game. “Kevin is out, unfortunately, but the rest of the players came back well. I don’t think [Kevin’s injury] is much, but he will be out for the next games I think,” Guardiola told a pre-match press conference on Friday. “Sergio is training well, and we are happy. Every team needs a striker, and we played without them. He has been training good, and we’re happy to see him back on the pitch after a long time. “Jesus has an injury in the front part of his leg. If there is another incident, we will lose him for a long time. I don’t know [how long he will be out for].”

The Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, has said that operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have been disarmed. This is in compliance with the directive of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, who announced the disbanding of SARS on Sunday. Odumosu, who addressed a group of lawyers protesting #EndSARS campaign, also claimed SARS offices have been shut down. According to him, the suspects in their custody have also been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) in Panti for the continuation of investigations. Odumosu said: “As per the directive of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) for disbandment (of SARS) if you come here you will see them in the regular police uniforms. “They’ve been disbanded, all their arms have been collected; the cases they were handling and the suspects have been transferred to the State CID, Panti for the continuation of investigations. “All these I have done in compliance with the Inspector-General of Police’s directive. In Lagos, we have many police formations. For example, the Special Fraud Unit are not to carry arms, they are in mufti. We have the Force CID personnel in Alagbon, they are not carrying arms and they are not to be in uniform. “But the one that the IG ordered to be disbanded now, has been disbanded. If you go to their offices now in Surulere, Gbagada, they are under lock and key.”

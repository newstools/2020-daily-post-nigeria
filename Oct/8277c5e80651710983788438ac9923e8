The Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre, Sam Adeyemi, has joined other prominent Nigerians to call on the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government, to urgently restructure the country. Adeyemi, on his verified Twitter handle on Monday, wrote: “When did it become a threat for citizens to express opinions, even if strong, about the structuring or restructuring of their country? Effective leaders listen.” His tweet was an apparent response to a statement released by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. The Presidency in the statement described recent calls for the restructuring of the country as “recurring threats to the corporate existence of the country.” The Presidency, in a reaction on Sunday night, had said, “This is to warn that such unpatriotic outbursts are both unhelpful and unwarranted as this government will not succumb to threats and take any decision out of pressure.”

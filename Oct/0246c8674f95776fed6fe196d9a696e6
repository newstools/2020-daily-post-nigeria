The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has called for an administrative or judicial investigation into the disbanded, Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS. CAN said the investigation is aimed at bringing the culprits to book not to allow the bad eggs among them corrupt other units or continue with their old habit of lawlessness. Rev. Samson Olasupo A. Ayokunle, the President of CAN, in a statement, called on the country’s security agencies to be reformed and transformed into a modern security architecture that befits the contemporary challenges such as terrorism, banditry, kidnapping, and herdsmen attacks. The observed, “Uniformed men and women should cherish the rare opportunity the country gave them and the trust of handling the security of the nation by behaving responsibly.” CAN said it is not happy with the automatic redevelopment of the officers and men of the disbanded unit to other units without sanctioning the bad eggs among them. CAN appreciates the prompt and positive responses of the Federal Government in disbanding SARS, adding, “It is unprecedented in recent history of our country and it is praiseworthy. This is what democracy is all about.” The body, however, acknowledges the spontaneous nature of protest nationwide but regrets the loss of lives and the destruction of some property in the cause of the mass actions. “We ask God to console and comfort all the bereaved as He heals those who are recuperating in the hospitals,” it prayed. The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, commends President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, for being sensitive and responsive to the clarion call for the disbanding of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). “We are aware of the circumstances that led to the agitation which included but not limited to alleged extra- judicial killings, unlawful arrests and detentions, extortion, tortures, and disappearances of detainees,” the statement explained.

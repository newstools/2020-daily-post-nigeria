Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has expressed his confidence that he will rediscover his goalscoring form again. Aubameyang has gone five Premier League matches without scoring. It is his longest goalless run as an Arsenal player, having not scored in the league since the opening day at Fulham. And the 31-year-old’s struggles have coincided with him signing a lucrative new deal in the summer. “We are not finding scoring goals easy at the moment,” Aubameyang said ahead of the trip to Manchester United on Sunday. “This happens in teams — I haven’t scored for a few games in the league, either. “But we’re an experienced team, with experienced attacking players and we know we will turn this around. I’m not worried about that.”

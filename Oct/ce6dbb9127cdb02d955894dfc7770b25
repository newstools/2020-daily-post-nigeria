The United Action for Change (UAC) has warned Lagos State Government not to politicize funding for business owners whose stores were looted by hoodlums. In a statement by Secretary General, Michael Popoola Ajayi and Publicity Secretary, Enitan Olukotun, UAC said the funds should not be largesse for politicians and their cronies. UAC demanded that the disbursement be conducted in a transparent and accountable manner to ameliorate pains of the victims. “We call on the government to set up a credible independent body that cut across various sectors to manage the screening and disbursement of funds to affected businesses, devoid of government influence”, it read. The statement advised Lagos to extend the deadline for application for the financial support. The body suggested inclusion of representatives of market women, journalists, Nigerian Bar Association, Nigeria Medical Association, Nigeria Labour Congress and the youths. UAC commiserated with the state government and families of the dead and injured. The group also commended the Lagos Command of the Police for its efforts towards restoring peace.

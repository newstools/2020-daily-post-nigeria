Adamu Ibrahim, a security guard in a filling station has been arrested for allegedly conniving with two other men to rob his employer. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident in a statement on Sunday. Oyeyemi said the suspect, who is attached to Inspiration Filling Station, Matogun area of Agbado in Ifo Local Government area of Ogun, was nabbed following a report at the police station by the duo of Ajibola Yusuf and Bakare Ifakayode, who he had allegedly contacted to rob his employer. According to Oyeyemi, Yusuf and Ifekayode had told the police at Agbado divisional headquarters that they received a phone call from the suspect, telling them that the Manager of the fuel station would be leaving for his house at about 8pm with a sum of N3million. “They reported further that the suspect, who described the Manager and his motorcycle to them, asked them to waylay and rob him of the money and kill him so as avoid being traced. “They stated further that the suspect believed that being ‘area boys’, they will be useful for him to realize his devilish plan,” saying being ‘area boys’ does not make them armed robbers. “Having been briefed by the two, the DPO of Agbado division, SP Kehinde Kuranga, had told the ‘area boys’ to continue playing along. “Unknown to the suspect, he was continuously calling the duo, telling them the discription of the manager and the route he will be passing through, when the police swooped on him and got him arrested,” Oyeyemi disclosed. Initially, he was said to have denied planning any robbery with anybody. He, however, owned up to the commission of the crime after he was confronted with his supposed accomplice. He reportedly confessed that the two ‘area boys’ resemble those who robbed the same station years ago, adding that that was why he thought they would help in carrying out the robbery operation.

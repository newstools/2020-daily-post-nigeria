As many as five Arsenal players could leave the club in the next 24 hours, according to the UK Mirror. Defender William Saliba could be set for another loan move away from the Emirates. Saliba signed last year from St Etienne but was allowed to remain with the Ligue 1 outfit until the end of the 2019/2020 campaign. He is, however, yet to make a single appearance for the Gunners and could leave for a Championship side, with Brentford believed to be keen. Emile Smith Rowe is another Arsenal player who played in England’s second-tier last term. The midfielder spent the latter half of the season at Huddersfield, where he scored twice in 19 games. The 20-year-old would be a major addition to any Championship club, where he would continue his development. Reiss Nelson, who is the same age as Smith Rowe, is another who could benefit from some time away. James Olayinka, another 20-year-old, spent part of last season away at League Two Northampton. The forward made a substitute appearance as the Cobblers secured promotion to the third tier via the play-offs. 19-year-old Folarin Balogun is a player who has attracted interest this summer and was reportedly the subject of a £3m bid. Arsenal are determined to keep him, but with chances of a first-team appearance low, he could also go out on loan.

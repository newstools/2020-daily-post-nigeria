Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, will miss the chance to go head-to-head with Lionel Messi in the Champions League next week, after returning another positive coronavirus test. Ronaldo contracted the virus last week while away on international duty with Portugal. Juve host Barcelona in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday. A report from Portuguese newspaper Correio da Manha claims Ronaldoâ€™s test gave a very low viral load despite returning positive and the Serie A champions are not giving up hope completely of him featuring in the game. It is believed the club will ask UEFA for permission to test Ronaldo 48 hours before the game on October 28. It will be up to the European football body to decide whether or not to allow such a request to go ahead. According to UEFA protocol, a player must test negative at least one week before a match to be considered for selection.

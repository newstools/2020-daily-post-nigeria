The All Progressives Congress, APC, on Monday blamed the illegalities of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, on the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. APC alleged that PDP used SARS to rig elections across the country. This claim was made by the ruling party’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, in a tweet on his official Twitter handle. According to Nabena: “PDP created the leviathan in SARS to rig elections.” Recall that Nigerian youths have been protesting the illegality and brutality of SARS operatives. The protest had led to the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu dissolving the unit. Adamu, however, noted that a new unit would be established to combat crime, following the dissolution of SARS. This followed a directive from President Muhammadu Buhari.

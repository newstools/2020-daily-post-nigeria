Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that midfielder, Billy Gilmour, will miss the Blues’ Champions League clash against Sevilla on Tuesday night due to injury. Gilmour suffered a severe knee injury towards the end of last season. Lampard, however, is now saying that the Scottish youngster will be back in action for Chelsea in four weeks. Lampard’s men head to the match following a 3-3 draw against Southampton in the Premier League on Saturday. “Billy is working really well,” Lampard told a pre-match press conference on Monday. “He is probably three or four weeks away from his return. “He is working outside with the physios at the moment, but we hope to integrate him into training with either ourselves or the Under-21s at some point soon. “We’re probably looking at the other side of the next international break with Billy, all being well.”Lampard

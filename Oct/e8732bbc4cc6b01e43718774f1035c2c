Governor Abdullahi Sule of Nasarawa State has noted that personnel of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, were trained to confront some situations the ordinary policemen cannot face. The Governor lamented the disbandment of the police unit, saying it should have been reformed instead. According to Sule, SARS was helpful in tackling insecurity in some parts of the country, especially the North. The Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu had over a week ago, dissolved the police unit after days of protests. “What the northern governors are saying is: for some of us, SARS has benefited us,” Sule said on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. “So, what is going to be the replacement for SARS now that you have discarded it? Even in some of these southern states, there were so many other places where SARS had been useful. But just like any other part of our system, you would find the bad eggs that have done something wrong.” “That is why some governors were asking for the reforming of the SARS. Instead of throwing the bathing water and the baby, go ahead and reform what is wrong,” he said. The Governor specifically pointed out that SARS officials were handy in combating armed robbery in Nasarawa State. “I got to understand that the SARS officers were actually well-trained officers to be able to face armed robbers and to be able to face those kinds of crimes which other policemen will not be able to do,” he said. Recall that the Northern Governors’ Forum, NGF, had also rejected disbandment of SARS, saying that the police unit had been useful in the fight against insecurity in the region.

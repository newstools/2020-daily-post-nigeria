The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, is in line to win a re-election. Akeredolu, who contested Saturday’s governorship election on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), is in an early lead as results continue to trickle in from polling units across the state. To retain his seat, the incumbent is in a tussle against Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Agboola Ajayi of the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). Although Jegede and Ajayi have pulled their weight in certain polling units (PU) and local government areas, Akeredolu has generally garnered more votes. So far, results of 606 out of 3,009 Polling Units have been collated. From the numbers available to DAILY POST, Akeredolu currently has 65,590 votes, while his nearest contender Jegede has 40,027.  Ajayi has polled 11,603 votes so far.

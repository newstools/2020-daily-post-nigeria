The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has described as “unlawful”, the Revolution Now Movement being convened by Omoyele Sowore, the 2019 Presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC). NANS said this in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, while dissociating its leadership and members from the Revolution Now Movement. In a statement made available to DAILY POST by its Spokesman, Azeez Adeyemi on Monday, NANS said “exercising rights to freedom of speech, association and assembly should be with decorum”; saying “Nigerian Students will not be part of any unlawful gathering in the name of revolution.” According to Adeyemi, the Revolution Now Movement’s call for mass action across the country against the Federal Government of Nigeria is uncalled for. “At a time when Nigeria is battling with barrage of Security Challenges, no sane or right-thinking individual will be instigating the populace against the Government,” he added. The NANS PRO called on all Nigerian Students and youths in general, to be law-abiding. He asked them not to allow anybody or agents of the fifth columnist to use them as cannon fodder. Speaking on the alleged unprofessional conducts of men of the Nigeria Police special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, the students body called on the Inspector General of Police, Muhammed Adamu, to regulate their activities or disband them. NANS accused SARS operatives of “gross misconduct, extortion of innocent citizen with unfounded allegations, harassing and intimidating the general public, killing of innocent Nigerian Students and citizen at will.” Threatening a showdown with Adamu, Adeyemi said, “We hereby give a seven-day ultimatum to the Inspector General of Police to regulate the activities of the men of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) or be ready to face the wrath of Nigerian students because never again will we allow this trigger intoxicated men to cut short the life of any Nigerian Students.”

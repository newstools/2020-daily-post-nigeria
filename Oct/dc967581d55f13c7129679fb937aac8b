The Rivers State Commissioner of Police, CP Joseph Mukan has declared total war against the miscreants who attacked and looted Police Stations in Oyigbo LGA. CP Mukan made the declaration during a meeting with DPOs and the Heads of Tactical Units in the Command. He gave the senior police officers the marching order to deploy both Intelligence and Patrols across the Command within the next 48hrs, to ensure that the items looted are recovered and perpetrators arrested with immediate effect. The charge comes days after the Command paraded twenty-one suspects who are being prosecuted. The CP further warned members of the proscribed Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB to relocate from the State as machinery have been put in place to fish them out and deal with them as a Terrorist group. ”Again the CP for the umpteenth time wishes to reiterate emphatically that Rivers State is not an IPOB State and will deal decisively with any group that carries out activities under that guise or any guise whatsoever. “IPOB has been outlawed by both the Federal and State Governments and to that extent is non-existent anywhere else, including Rivers State. “Hence, Parents and Guardians should warn their Children/Wards to be law-abiding or else bear the full weight of the law,” Spokesman of the Command, SP Nnamdi Omoni said a statement. He further enjoined members of the public to increase their security consciousness and report any suspicious character or the whereabouts of any of the looted property to the nearest Police Station.

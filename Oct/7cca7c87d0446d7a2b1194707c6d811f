Asari Dokubo, a former militant leader in the Niger Delta region, has told ex-president Goodluck Jonathan to stop fooling himself by running around the Aso Rock thinking he would be considered for presidency come 2023. Dokubo said this in a Facebook address on Sunday, cautioning Jonathan not to fall for calls by emissaries, advising him to run for the 2023 presidential election. The ex-militant leader said this despite being a strong supporter of the Bayelsa-born former President while in and out of office. He frowned on Jonathan’s consistent visits to President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa. Jonathan’s last visit to the Presidential Villa was on October 15, 2020, when he briefed President Buhari on the political crisis in Mali being the Special Envoy/Mediator to the West African country. However, Asari in his Facebook post, used unprintable words on Jonathan, lambasting him for paying frequent visits to Buhari. He said: “Goodluck Jonathan is now fooling himself running around to Aso Rock thinking that they are going to give him the presidency come 2023. ”They are not going to give you [Jonathan] anything. They will disgrace you and take away that small respect that you have and throw you in the trash can. But we are watching, let them prove us wrong and let us see.”

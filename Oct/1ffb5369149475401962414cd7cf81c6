Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Wednesday faulted claims by the Army that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State invited them to Lekki toll gate, amid the End SARS protest. Kanu claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the soldiers to kill the protesters not Sanwo-Olu. Recall that gunmen in military uniform had last week Tuesday stormed the Lekki toll gate and shot at peaceful protesters. The gunmen had killed some of the protesters during the crisis. But, following the backlash, the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army had admitted that it’s soldiers were present at the scene of the protest but did not kill anybody. The division also disclosed that they stormed Lekki toll gate on the order of Sanwo-Olu. However, the IPOB leader described the Army’s claim as false. In a tweet, Kanu insisted that the governor was not the head of Army. He tweeted: “Nobody should believe @HQNigerianArmy’s claim that it was @jidesanwoolu that ordered for soldiers to be brought to #Lekki. “It’s a brazen LIE. Since when did Governors become Army Commanders. #LekkiMassacre was ordered by the Fulanized @NGRPresident and executed by a Fulanized Army.”

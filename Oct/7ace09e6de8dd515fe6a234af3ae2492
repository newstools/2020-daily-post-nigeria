The Police Command in Ekiti has recovered three vehicles abandoned by robbers who invaded Wema Bank in Iyin-Ekiti on Friday. The cars are Volkswagen Golf, marked GED 906 AA; Acura MDX Jeep marked LSR 327 CD; and Toyota Camry marked GED 106 ER. Sunday Abutu, the Public Relations Officer, said Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), Indian hemp, alcoholic drinks and two cell phones, were also found. Abutu, in a statement, recalled that the armed gang numbering about ten stormed the financial institution at about 3:55 pm. The spokesman disclosed that they overpowered the policemen on guard at the bank due to their large number. He confirmed that an undisclosed amount of cash was carted away but no casualty was recorded. Abutu said reinforcement to the scene forced the robbers to retreat with the three vehicles.

Arsenal begins their European dreams with a Group B match with Rapid Vienna on Thursday. The Gunners will make the trip to the Austrian side ahead of their Europa League opener. They lost 1-0 Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City side at the weekend and have a difficult test against Leicester City next week. This scenario could lure Mikel Arteta into some personnel changes for the opening Group B tie against Rapid Vienna away from home. The home side has won all the four games in a row and as Arsenal visits them they would be confident in taking Arsenal down in the fixture. Here DAILY POST takes a look at how the London side could line-up in the Austrian capital. Absent; Shkodran Mustafi (hamstring), Pablo Mari (ankle), Gabriel Martinelli (knee), Calum Chambers (knee) Possible: Rob Holding (hamstring) Emile Smith Rome (shoulder), Some of Arsenal new signing would be in competition for a place to make their debut. Thomas Partey was a second-half substitute against Pep Guardiola’s side at the weekend while Runar Alex Runarsson has been forced to watch from the bench since joining up from Dijon last month. Also, more team changes are expected in Mikel Arsenals side, with Reiss Nelson, Joe Willock and Edward Nketiah all in contention to return to action for Arsenal. But due to the lack of defensive covers, it may well be a case of David Luiz keeping his place at the backline thus providing his side with the required experience. The young Spanish boss could also opt to revert to a back four, allowing him to add another extra central midfield to the side. Bukayo Saka was closely involved in most goals in this competition last season than any other Arsenal player. But he is likely to be given a rest against Rapid Vienna.

Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, on Saturday, alleged that the Federal Government and the All Progressives Congress, APC, will do all they can to ensure victory in the Ondo State governorship election. Fani-Kayode pointed out that the governorship election in Ondo State would be tough. He, however, noted that despite efforts by the federal government, Eyitayo Jegede, governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, would win. Justifying why Jegede must win, the former minister said Ondo State needs a dynamic and strong leader. In a tweet, the former minister wrote: “I pray for my brother @TayoJegedeSAN and @OfficialPDPNig today. I know it will be tough and the federal government @OfficialAPCNg will do all they can to win but this must not deter us. I hope and believe that Eyitayo will prevail because Ondo deserves a dynamic and strong Governor. God speed brother.”

Three protesters, who were arrested by the Ogun State Police Command for allegedly causing violence during Saturday’s End SARS protests, have been arraigned on Monday. The Ogun State Police Public Relations, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed this in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST. Abimbola said the three protesters have been granted bail. The three men, who Adeyemi alleged had caused the disturbance at the Olowu Palace, were arraigned at Isabo Magistrate’s Court, Abeokuta, “from where they were taken to a correctional centre pending when their bail conditions would be perfected.” This, he said, was contrary to reports making the rounds on social media that the three protesters have been jailed for life. He said, “The Command wishes to state that the information is not true and it is a calculated attempt to instigate members of the public against the police,” the PPRO informed. Aside from disrupting the Owu Festival, Oyeyemi added that the three men “vandalized public properties and injured one police Sergeant on duty at the palace.” “To give peace a chance, 27 other persons arrested from other parts of the state including the defunct SARS office were released by the Command yesterday 11/10/2020 regardless of the fact that two of our policemen injured by the protesters are in critical condition in the hospital. It is, therefore, not true that those arraigned have been jailed for life as being circulated on social media. The information is an outright falsehood from those criminal elements who want to continue to disturb the peace in Ogun State by all means. “All the good people of the State should be wary of these antics and never allow these individuals with ulterior motives to destabilize the State,” the statement read in part.

The Nigerian military has been urged to go tough against remnants of terrorists in the country following the launch of the Operation Crocodile Smile. Recall that the Nigerian army had announced that a new phase of the military exercise would commence on Tuesday, October 20, 2020, nationwide. However, following the launch of the exercise, many Nigerians had expressed divergent reactions that the development came at a time some Nigerians are on the streets demanding an end to police brutality. But, the Coalition of Progressive Yoruba Youths, believes that the exercise would further quell terrorism and banditry in some parts of Nigeria Comrade Kola Salau, president of the coalition, in a statement on Monday, said Nigerians must forget about the cynicism and attempt to paint the current exercise in a bad light. He said, “You’ll agree with us that after the Nigerian military made significant progress in quelling terrorism and banditry in parts of the country, that it’s likely that some of the criminal elements may have escaped into the hinterland to continue their heinous acts. “Recent events leading to the disbandment of the Special Anti Robbery Squad, SARS, of the Nigeria Police Force, have also given citizens concerns about the internal security situation in Nigeria and the police and other security agencies forced out of the streets, concerned Nigerians have expressed fears that crime and criminal activities may escalate in the country. “In the same vein, since the suspected terrorists and criminal elements are running away from other parts of the country like the Northeast, Northwest, North central and other parts of the country, it’s only appropriate for the army to launch Operation CROCODILE SMILES VI to apprehend these elements and the make the country peaceful and secure for the people.”

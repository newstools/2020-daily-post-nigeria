An articulated vehicle laden with petrol has exploded in Lagos. The incident occurred Tuesday morning at a petrol station along Ajayi Road, Ogba. Emergency responders are at the scene. Also, in Ikorodu, a building in Isiu Town, has collapsed. The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) have arrived at the location. No causality has been reported in both situations. A tanker just got exploded in a filling station few minutes ago at Ogba. Been calling the fire service but their line has been busy @LAG_FireService @JT_ThePostman @LasgoOfficial @jidesanwoolu pic.twitter.com/tvVz5TIgfv — 𝕄𝕣. 𝔼𝕔𝕠 #EndSars (@baba_econ) October 27, 2020

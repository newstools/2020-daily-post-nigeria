An 11-year-girl, Favour Okechukwu, has been allegedly raped to death in Lagos State. The incident happened at No 4, Olarenwaju Street in Ejigbo area before 4pm on Thursday, the Nation reports. Sources at Ejigbo Police station where the incident was reported, disclosed that five suspects have been arrested. Mrs. Helen Ibeji, the President of International Child Initiative and Women Development Foundation (ICI-WODEF), gave an account of the incident. “Her mother sent her to buy gala and that was the last time she saw her. Probably these agents of darkness have been trailing her for some time. “She did not return from buying the gala. She said her corpse was found in the room, lying stark naked in the room where she was raped to death,” Ibeji said. Police have since invited the Lagos State DNA & Forensic Center (LSD & FC), who took the body of the victim away for forensic analysis.

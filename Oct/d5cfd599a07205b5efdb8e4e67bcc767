For the first time this year, the Super Eagles will be in action, when they face Algeria in an international friendly on Friday. COVID-19 has considerably affected football in 2020 and Gernot Rohr’s plans for the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series. But the game against the Desert Foxes ensures he hits the refresh button. What should we expect? “First time together for the team after a year out due to COVID, Rohr is under immense pressure to deliver and continue the good form of last year and prove he deserved the new deal. “New players will face strong Algeria and Tunisia side in a major test and prove themselves in absence of Ndidi, Etebo, Osimhen and Aribo,” BBC’s Oluwashina Okeleji tells DAILY POST. Which players should we be looking at? “I’ll like to see how some of the new guys can start. Players like Akpoguma and Dessers – I hope they get good opportunities to play. “I’ll also be looking out for the more regular faces like Chukwueze, Iheanacho, Ajayi etc They are important to whatever Rohr is building,” Deji Faremi of BusyBuddies says. Solace Chukwu, who reports on Nigerian and African players for Goal, however, does not expect it to be an easy contest. “I’m expecting Algeria to dominate the game, what with the injuries the Super Eagles have in midfield. “Algeria have a more settled squad, and that should serve them well,” Chukwu said.

The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has confirmed that training for the newly-created Special Weapon and Tactics Team (SWAT), will begin on Monday. Adamu, on Sunday, also listed the qualifications of officers to be trained in the new police tactical team to replace the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The IGP, in a statement signed by the Force Public Relations Officer, Frank Mba, insisted no ex-SARS operatives were shortlisted in the SWAT team. According to him, “the officers selected for the training are young, smart and energetic officers who have acquired not less than seven years working experience with clean service records – no pending disciplinary matters, no record of violation of rights of citizens or misuse of firearms – and are physically fit to withstand the rigour of SWAT Training and Operations. “The selected officers shall be subjected to physical fitness test, medical and toxicology screening etc and those found to be unsuitable shall be discharged.” Adamu promised Nigerians that the SWAT team “will operate within very high professional and ethical standards, rule of law and dictates of best international policing practices.”

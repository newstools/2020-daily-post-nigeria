The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has debunked the reports of fuel scarcity in Abuja. However, Alhaji Suleiman Yakubu, IPMAN National Public Relations Officer, in an interview with newsmen on Tuesday said that some fuel station owners were only scared of their properties being attacked or damaged by hoodlums. Some business owners had shut down operations following the violence that erupted after the End SARS protest in many parts of the country. According to him, there is no fuel scarcity in the territory. “The long queues in some parts of Abuja were due to fear of attacks by hoodlums. “People should not fear and embark on panic buying as there is enough fuel on ground. “I also urge the youths to shun violence and embrace peace for a better economy,” he said.

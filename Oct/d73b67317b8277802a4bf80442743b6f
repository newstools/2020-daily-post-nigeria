Hundreds of youths have broken into a warehouse in Adamawa State and helped themselves with available food items, sources said Sunday morning. Sources told DAILY POST that the youths got into the warehouse, located at a community along the Yola-Numan Road called Kwarnawaya, near the state capital, Yola, and carted away rice and other food items. A woman is heard in a trending video calling on residents to go to the place and get what they could get for themselves. A staff of the warehouse who spoke on phone on condition of anonymity did not confirm that items had been stolen, but said although attempts were being made, the security operatives guarding the warehouse had so far proved too much for the youths to penetrate. In a trending video that supports this version of the story, security operatives are seen standing between the warehouse and the youths and warning the youths to keep off. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in Adamawa State, DSP Suleiman Nguroje who responded to a call as this story was being filed Sunday morning, said he was on his way to the scene. “We have heard that hundreds of people have gathered and are looting food stuff at a storage facility in Kwanarwaya. “We have mobilized policemen and are on our way to the scene to restore peace and order,” he said. But another video later surfaced at 11 am Sunday, showing a door of the warehouse thrown open and jubilant youths making their way in.

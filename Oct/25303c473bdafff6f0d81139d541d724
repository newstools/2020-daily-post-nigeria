Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has two games to save his job, L’Equipe reports. Los Blancos have started the 2020/2021 season on a shaky note. Zidane’s men have suffered embarrassing back-to-back losses against newly-promoted Cadiz in LaLiga and Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League. However, Madrid are just one point off the top of the league with one game in hand. Their next fixture is a Clasico in Barcelona, followed by a Champions League clash with Borussia Monchengladbach. Speaking after their 3-2 defeat to Shakhtar on Wednesday, Zidane said: “We know the situation we’re in. It’s our second bad game. “Now we have to prepare our next game. It’s clear that I’m responsible.”

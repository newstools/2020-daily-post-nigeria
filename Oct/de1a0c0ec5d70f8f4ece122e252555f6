Some staff of the University of Ibadan on Wednesday protested against what they termed as ‘imposition’ of some candidates for the position of Vice-Chancellor of the University. DAILY POST gathered that no fewer than eighteen professors are jostling for the position of the University’s Vice-Chancellor. The tenure of the incumbent Vice-Chancellor, Professor Idowu Olayinka will expire in November this year. The new Vice-Chancellor is expected to resume duty on December 1st 2020.

The shortlisted candidates are; Prof Kayode Adebowale, Professor Olusegun Ademowo, Professor Olatunde Farombi, Professor Abideen Aderinto, Professor Babatunde Salako and Professor Femi Mimiko.

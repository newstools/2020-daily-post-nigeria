End SARS protesters are now at the entrance of the National Assembly in Abuja. Hundreds of them moved in a long convoy of vehicles, including some damaged at Berger. One of them Adebayo Raphael gave an update on Twitter. “SP U. A. Sambo just asked us to wait for him to check if there are any legislators in either of the two chambers. “The National Assembly must commit to fix our damaged cars, otherwise we sleep here and continue our #EndPoliceBrutality protests”, he tweeted. Peaceful demonstrators were earlier today attacked by some boys with sticks. In a coordinated movement, they stormed the rally ground and pounced on cars and individuals demanding an end to Police excesses in Nigeria. WE ARE FINALLY AT THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY INSIDE THE FREAKING RAIN!!! NO GOING BACK!!!! #ENDSARS#AbujaProtest #EndPoliceBrutality!!! pic.twitter.com/vJwnisenns — ADÉBÁYỌ̀ RAPHAEL (@Adebayo_Ralph) October 14, 2020

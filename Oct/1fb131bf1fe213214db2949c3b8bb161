Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said there is still nothing concrete on moves for Houssem Aouar and Thomas Partey to join his team before transfer deadline day. The Gunners are still in negotiations with Lyon for Aouar but have so far fallen short of their asking price. They also retain an interest in Atletico Madrid’s Partey as Arteta tries to bolster his midfield. Lucas Torreira is believed to be on the verge of moving to Atletico, while Sokratis, Matteo Guendouzi, Shkodran Mustafi and Sead Kolasinac are all attracting interest ahead of next week’s deadline. But when asked of possible incomings and outcomings, Arteta told a media conference on Friday: “I will give you an update with any player the moment that we have an update to give. “At the moment, unfortunately, there is nothing concrete for any player.” On the chances of Aouar arriving, he added: ‘I am very confident with what we are trying to do internally. The clarity and support I’m finding from everybody at the club to try and improve the team as we can. “But most importantly as well, to get the right balance in the squad for now and the way we want to evolve the squad in the future. So we are all very much aligned. I’m afraid I can’t give you any updates or news.”

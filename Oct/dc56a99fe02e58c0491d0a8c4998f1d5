Manchester United goalkeeper, David De Gea, has apologized to fans following their 6-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. The Red Devils took the lead as early as the first minute of the game at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes calmly stroked his penalty past Hugo Lloris, after Marcus Rashford was fouled in the box. However, from that point Spurs took over and scored six times. Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son both netted twice, while Tanguy Ndombele and Serge also got on the scoresheet. The result means United are yet to win at home this season, after their opening day 3-1 loss to Crystal Palace. De Gea, who has now conceded 11 goals this season already, wrote on his Twitter page: “We feel exactly like you. No excuses. Sorry.” United have three points from their opening three fixtures going into the international break.

The Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) has strongly condemned the shooting and killing of peaceful protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate on Tuesday. The church, in a statement by its Public Relations Taskforce Committee Chairman, Collins Edomaruse, said it was deeply saddened by the unwarranted, unnecessary, callous, brutal and inhuman use of live bullets by the security forces on Nigerian youths in Lagos, who were on peacefully protesting. MFM noted that the blood of those who shed innocent blood, will certainly be shed and their wickedness will consume them. The statement reads, “It was indeed a Black Tuesday in the annals of Lagos and Nigeria. This is least expected in this century. While youths all over the world are contributing their quota to good governance, the security forces are shooting their own in cold blood, devoid of human feelings and empathy. “Biblical principles of the Almighty God says that the wickedness of the wicked will consume the wicked. Those who shed innocent blood, their blood will undoubtedly be shed. Let it be known that whatever is done under cover of darkness with the belief that nobody sees it, will surely be brought to light and God the Ultimate Judge, will judge speedily. “For it is written in Psalm 10.18 ‘You will hear the cries of the oppressed and the orphans; you will judge in their favour so that mortal man may cause terror no more.” It also commiserated with the parents and guardians of the victims of the incident and prayed for other Nigerians negatively affected by the unfortunate and avoidable situation. MFM advised the federal governemnt that utmost care and caution, and divine wisdom, should be employed in bringing a lasting solution to the problem at hand.

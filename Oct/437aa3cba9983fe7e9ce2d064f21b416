The Baale of Imokun, High Chief Suwaliyu Muritala, has called on Lagos authorities to put an end to the activities of land grabbers. The community is within Eredo LCDA of Epe. The monarch on Wednesday lamented that the actions of the “Ajagun gbale” (grabber) had become unbearable. He said they invaded the town, destroyed properties and chased away original landowners. “This is becoming intolerable and barbaric. The government should come to our aid and put a stop to this turmoil. My people don’t sleep with their two eyes closed because the land grabbers operate day and night,” NAN quoted him saying. He urged the state government to act urgently to avoid full-blown violence. Tunde Adedeji, a youth leader, recalled that Imokun never experienced attacks during the administration of Akinwunmi Ambode. Ibrahim Adeola, a member of surveyors association, Epe Division, said land grabbers had caused several disputes. Adeola listed communities invaded as Imokun, Eredo, Epe central, Ikosi-Ejirin, Agbowa, Ibeju Lekki. He disclosed that petitions written to the Commissioner of Police, Police Stations in Noforija and Epe, Nigerian Army, Department of State Services (DSS), and others have not yielded results.

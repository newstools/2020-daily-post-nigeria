Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has singled out left-back, Ben Chilwell, for praise following his impressive performance in the Blues’ Premier League 4-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon. Chilwell, who made his 100th Premier League appearance in Chelsea’s win against Crystal Palace, scored a goal and also provided an assist. Chelsea defeated Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge, thanks to goals from Chilwell, Kurt Zouma and a penalty brace from Jorginho. Lampard said Chilwell was fantastic in his contribution in all senses against the visitors. “I thought Ben Chilwell was fantastic in his contribution in all senses. He gets his goal, he gets an assist, and he was always ready to join in,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying after the game. “He’s Premier League ready, we know that having played in this league as well as he has for Leicester and he looked like he’d played for us for a long time. “I admired him before because of his ability to be so high up the pitch when you want him, not that he’s being reckless by being there. “He just arrives, he’s got the capacity to get up and back, great quality on the ball, and he’s a great lad.” Chilwell will now hope to continue his brilliant display for Chelsea when they face Southampton in their next Premier League fixture.

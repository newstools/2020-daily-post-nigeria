The chairman of the Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, NIDCOM, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has reacted to the arrest of End SARS protesters in Cairo, Egypt. Nollywood actress, Toyin Abraham had on Sunday raised the alarm that Nigerians protesting in Cairo were arrested by Egyptian Police on Saturday. She said, “Aunty Abike @abikedabiri please we are waiting to hear from you ma. The peaceful protesters that were arrested in Cairo should be released.” Reacting, Dabiri in a tweet on Sunday said the Nigerians who were arrested, protested without permit. She further stated that the Nigerian Embassy was engaging the Egyptians authorities. Dabiri wrote, “Nigerian mission did not call the Police. In Cairo, gatherings without permits are banned. In Egypt you can’t even travel from one part of the country without a permit to travel from the state you live. They have their own rules which they strictly enforce. “However, the mission will be engaging with the Authorities to see what can be done. “The Egyptian police dispersed them, then traced them to a very far place. They didn’t arrest them at the mission. They came in a bus driven by an Egyptian. “The driver has also been arrested. The mission will do all they can. Egypt is very very strict with their laws.”

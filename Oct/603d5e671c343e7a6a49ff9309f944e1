All the candidates for the 2020 Ondo governorship election, on Tuesday, signed a peace accord to ensure a violence-free poll. Those present were the Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu of All Progressives Congress (APC), Eyitayo Jegede of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), and the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) candidate and deputy governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi, along with the candidates of other parties. However, there was mild drama at the end of the event, as Akeredolu refused to shake hands with his deputy, Ajayi. The three major candidates were asked to embrace, shake hands or bump elbows with one another as a sign that they had embraced peace. Akeredolu greeted Jegede by bumping elbows, but when it was the turn of his deputy, the governor refused to shake hands with or embrace him. Instead, he just waved at Ajayi.

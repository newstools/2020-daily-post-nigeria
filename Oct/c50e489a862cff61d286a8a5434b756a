Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has warned that his former club could come unstuck against Manchester United on Sunday, after their struggles against Leicester City on Sunday night. The Gunners lost 1-0 to the Foxes at the Emirates, thanks to Jamie Vardy’s late header. Mikel Arteta’s side dominated the game in the first half, but failed to register a goal, allowing Leicester grow slowly into the match. Wright feels United’s pacy attack could make Arsenal pay, if they don’t find a way of “digging in”. He said: “You look at Manchester United as well who are another team that will want to play on the break. “You’re going to need to be able to pass through them, be able to break them down. Manchester United will do the same thing [as Leicester] and they’ve got even better players going forward, more than just Vardy. “Arsenal are going to have to dig in and find a way of getting results without scoring the perfect goal.”

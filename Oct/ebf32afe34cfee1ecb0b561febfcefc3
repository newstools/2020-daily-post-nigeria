Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has signed an Executive Order proscribing the Nnamdi Kanu-led Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in the state. Wike made the announcement in a state-wide broadcast in Port Harcourt on Wednesday, insisting that Rivers is home to all tribes. The Governor announced the decision hours after he also lifted a ban on movement imposed in some parts of the state earlier. There were curfew in Mile 1, Mile 2, Ilabuchi, Ikokwu areas among others. He, however, said Oyigbo Local Government Area will remain under curfew while the Ikokwu market will remain shut. Wike also announced the ban on tricycles’ movement in all major roads in the state. Wike said, “We have everything against the presence and activities of the legally proscribed and anarchic Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and whatever that group stands for in Rivers State. “This is clearly a terrorist group whose existence, creed, mission, and activities are strongly denounced even by the Government and peoples of the South-Eastern States of the country. “I have, therefore, signed the executive order to reinforce the total ban on IPOB and its activities in Rivers State or any part thereof and nothing will stop us from enforcing this ban in its entirety.”

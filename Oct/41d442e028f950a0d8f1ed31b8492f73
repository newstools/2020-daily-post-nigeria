The All Progressives Congress (APC) has hailed President Muhammadu Buhari for presenting the proposed 2021 budget. The budgetary estimate was tendered before a Joint Session of the 9th National Assembly on Thursday. APC spokesman, Yekini Nabena, in a statement, expressed confidence that the legislature will consolidate its patriotic disposition by speedily considering and passing the appropriation bill into law. He said this would enable implementation by January 1 2021 as canvassed by the President. Nabena noted that the Buhari administration is not oblivious of the perseverance and continued support Nigerians have displayed since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the crash in oil prices. He said the government has not been found wanting in its resolve to cushion the biting effects on the citizenry while delivering on key policies, programmes and critical infrastructure projects. Nabena listed some as railway projects, roads and the second Niger Bridge. The ruling party appealed to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and lecturers to show patriotism by supporting the governmentâ€™s intentions on the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). APC said the policy was to streamline and check incidence of payments to non-existent personnel and unauthorised allowances by enrolling in the IPPIS. It further urged ASUU to end the ongoing strike.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, could contest the presidential election in 2023 as their candidate. PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, stated this while answering questions from reporters in Bauchi, during a solidarity visit on Governor Bala Mohammed, on Friday. Secondus was asked if the opposition party will re-present Atiku, who lost in the 2019 poll to President Muhammadu Buhari. According to him, PDP is open for any candidate willing to contest on its platform. “There is no room for discrimination. “Everyone is qualified; both young, old, governors, non-governors are qualified to contest and we have the space for everyone – if you win, you become our candidate. “The door is open to everybody,” Secondus said.

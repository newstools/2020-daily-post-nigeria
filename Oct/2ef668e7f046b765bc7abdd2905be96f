President Muhammadu Buhari has finally spoken on the ongoing nationwide protests against alleged brutality and extortion by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The protests have been going on nationwide for over 72 hours. In a statement late on Friday night, Buhari confirmed that he had met with the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. The president expressed his determination to reform the Police Force and ensure that officers are fully accountable to Nigerians. “The IG already has my firm instructions to conclusively address the concerns of Nigerians regarding these excesses and ensure erring personnel are brought to justice. I appeal for patience and calm, even as Nigerians freely exercise their right to peacefully make their views known. “The vast majority of men and women of the Nigeria Police Force are patriotic and committed to protecting the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians, and we will continue to support them to do their job,” the statement posted in his Twitter handle read in part. On Friday, men of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) threw teargas canisters at peaceful protesters in Abuja, the nation’s capital. The police tear-gassed the protesters in a bid to disperse them.

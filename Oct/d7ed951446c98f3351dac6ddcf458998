Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has admitted he was “not satisfied” with manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s decision to substitute him at half time of their 6-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. Fernandes was replaced for the second half, with United down to 10 men and losing 4-1 at Old Trafford. Since then, there have been reports that the player is not happy with Solskjaer and his tactics. Speaking after Portugal’s 3-0 win over Sweden on Wednesday, Fernandes insisted that things have been blown out of proportion. “I was replaced at half-time, it is true, by technical option. The coach told me that the game was almost over and that we would have a lot of games ahead of us. “I was not satisfied but said nothing that could harm the group,” he told A’Bola.

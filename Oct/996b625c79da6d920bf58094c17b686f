Thomas Partey could have left Atletico Madrid to Arsenal last summer, the UK Guardian reports. However, the then Gunners boss, Unai Emery, made signing a right winger his priority. Emery even undertook a personal scouting trip to watch Partey in action against Levante in May 2019. But he eventually chose to pursue a move for Crystal Palaceâ€™s Wilfried Zaha. The Spaniard was overruled by the Arsenal board, who opted to sign Nicolas Pepe from Lille. Partey eventually became an Arsenal player this year, after the Gunners left it late to activate his release clause moments before the transfer deadline.

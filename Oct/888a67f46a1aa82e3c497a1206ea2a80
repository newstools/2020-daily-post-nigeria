Nigeria played out a 1-1 draw with Tunisia on Tuesday night. It was the Super Eagles’ second friendly game within four days in Austria. Gernot Rohr’s men were defeated 1-0 by Algeria on Friday. However, against the Carthage Eagles, Nigeria took an early lead after Kelechi Iheanacho controlled the ball inside the box and fired home. The Leicester City forward had the chance to double the lead, but his weak penalty was easily saved by Ben Mustapha. Tunisia levelled before the break, after Mohamed Draeger swept home a cross. Rohr will now turn his attention to a double header against Sierra Leone in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying series.

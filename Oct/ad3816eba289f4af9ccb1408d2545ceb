The Vice-Chancellor of Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, Professor Timothy Adebayo has urged President Muhammadu Buhari and Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State to save students and staff of the university plying the Ogbomoso-Oyo road. The Vice Chancellor noted that this is necessary to reduce the suffering of staff and students and other road users. Adebayo, who recently assumed office as the Vice Chancellor of the institution, made this appeal via a statement made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. He said that the students and staff of the university and other road users plying the Ogbomoso-Oyo road are having harrowing experiences. He appealed to Buhari, Makinde and other concerned authorities to urgently repair the bad portions of the road. He said the road has great economic impact on Oyo State, in terms of movement of people and goods, including foodstuff. “I am compelled to call on the State and Federal governments to urgently repair that road in order to alleviate the suffering of road users, especially our students and staff who ply that road daily,” he said.

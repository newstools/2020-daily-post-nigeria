The Nigerian Army has announced the arrest of one of its personnel. The Army described him as a “hooded soldier”. His name was given as Lance Corporal Harrison Friday. In a post on Twitter Wednesday morning, the Army said Friday hid behind a mask to commit cyber crimes. “Be rest assured cyber criminals have no hiding place”, the military arm tweeted. A viral video showed a soldier appealing to his colleagues not to harm End SARS protesters. The Army reacted by calling the footage “fake news”. Several respondents are saying that the man in the video is not the one arrested. They are citing similarities including the lips of the hooded soldier in the video and those of the personnel arrested. Nigerians are also reminding the Army that they had labeled the footage fake, wondering when it became genuine. Troops opened fire on peaceful protesters in the Lekki area of Lagos Tuesday night. Many are feared dead and several injured. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-850448" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201021_081935.jpg" alt="" width="687" height="950" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201021_081935.jpg 687w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201021_081935-217x300.jpg 217w" sizes="(max-width: 687px) 100vw, 687px">

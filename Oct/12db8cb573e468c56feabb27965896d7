Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said that legendary boss, Arsene Wenger, is welcome to return to the club. Addressing a media conference on Thursday ahead of this weekend’s Premier League trip to Manchester City, Arteta said Wenger needs to be “closer” to the squad. Wenger stepped down at the Emirates in May 2018 and has not returned ever since. Earlier this week, the Frenchman explained that he still followed the Gunners from a distance. However, Arteta has indicated that he would be happy for Wenger to be given a role at Arsenal. “I would like to see him back around us. He was a massive figure for me, he’s someone I can still learn a lot of things from. “I would like to have him closer to us, obviously the environment doesn’t allow us to do it. “But I think he’s a figure who has to be very present in what we do at the football club because he’s, in my opinion, the one who had the vision and helped this club to evolve and help this club be what it is today,” Arteta said.

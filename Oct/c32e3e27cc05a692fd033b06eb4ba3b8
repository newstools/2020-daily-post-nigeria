There was a mild drama in Lagos as a man insisted that his girlfriend, now pregnant for a friend he accommodated, come back to him. The incident occured Thursday night near Ikota Shopping Complex. Eyewitnesses told DAILY POST that the jilted lover boy caused a scene that attracted security operatives. The unidentified citizen, who resides in Obalende, narrated the matter as a crowd surrounded both parties. In his recount, the man said earlier in the year, he provided shelter to his friend. The complaint recalled that the pal discussed his situation and urgently needed a place to stay. Soon after ease of the lockdown occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic, his girlfriend also needed accommodation and joined them. The man disclosed that he was always out for work most part of weekdays. Admitting that he introduced the lady to the friend as his sister, he said the duo moved out of his place without notification. The man said he was worried and tried all he could to reach them to no avail. It was later he discovered that the friend had impregnated his sweetheart hence their decision to flee. The man said he finally traced the new couple to an area close to Thomas Estate in Ajah. However, despite the lady’s condition, the lover boy wants her back. Speaking, the friend stated that the complainant should be blamed for hiding his relationship. “It’s not my fault, you told me she’s your sister. Am I lying?”, he was quoted as saying. It was gathered that the lady, in her twenties, remained quiet while the argument lasted. While some blamed her for sleeping with the friend even while in an affair with their host, others told the man to take responsibility and accept his fate. Still, he vowed not to leave without her and was losing control. His violent behaviour was suppressed by security personnel. They then dispersed everyone as the 8pm curfew approached.

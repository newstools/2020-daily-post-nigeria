Arsenal is hoping to offload Lucas Torreira and Sead Kolasinac in the next few days, as they try to land Houssem Aouar from Lyon, the Evening Standard reports. Aouar has become Mikel Arteta’s top priority this summer, with the window set to close on Monday, October 5. Thomas Partey was Arteta’s No. 1 target, but Atletico Madrid are adamant on their valuation and time is running out. The Gunners have been active in the transfer market, but they have not shifted players in time. The club will now concentrate on getting Torreria and Kolasinac out. A £30m bid for Aouar was rejected by Lyon, but a new offer is being readied. But Arsenal needs more cash in the bank before launching another raid on the midfielder. Atletico is the most interested in Torreira, but favour a loan rather than a permanent deal, while Kolasinac looks set to return to Germany.

Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has lifted the 24hour indefinite curfew imposed on the State. The Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Mr Donald Ojogo, said on Friday in Akure, that the decision is with effect from Saturday. Akeredolu had imposed the curfew on Wednesday to prevent loss of lives and properties as End SARS protesters took to the street in some major cities of the State. Ojogo explained that the decision to lift the curfew followed consultations between the governor and security chiefs after a preliminary assessment of the security situation in the State. “The relative peace in the state capital, Akure, appears very encouraging just as the people’s resolve, especially the youths, not to allow brigandage under any guise is equally palpable. “It’s, therefore, only normal that law-abiding residents are allowed to go about their legitimate businesses. “Government, however, emphasizes the need for all to be vigilant and law-abiding. “This is more so, that security agencies deployed to strategic areas of the state capital are under strict directives to enforce law and order for the enforcement of permanent peace,” he said.

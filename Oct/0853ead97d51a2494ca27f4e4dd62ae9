Leader of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Pastor Adewale Giwa, has described President Muhammadu Buhari as weak and incapacitated. Giwa, in a statement to DAILY POST on Friday, said that one of the dangers of a “weak president” is Impunity of SARS. There have been nationwide protests over the activities of SARS in the past few days and Giwa believes that those parading themselves as SARS officers are repentant armed robbers who disguise to be working for the police. “It’s unfortunate that President Muhammadu Buhari has obviously become incapacitated. In all fairness, presidential weakness is bad for the nation. “One of the dangers of a weak president is Impunity of SARS. Those parading themselves as SARS, to me, are repentant armed robbers who disguise to be working for the police. “They have robbed Nigerians who struggle to survive under the bad administration of President Muhammadu Buhari over the years. The end has come to their operation. “They should take them to Sambisa forest to combat members of Boko Haram instead of becoming nuisances on the streets. “I strongly call on the Inspector General of Police to listen to the cries of Nigerians and disband SARS expeditiously.”

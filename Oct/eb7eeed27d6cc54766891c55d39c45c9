The Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano yesterday terminated the appointment of his Senior Special Adviser on Security, Mr James Nwafor in fulfilment of the demand of EndSARS protesters. Nwafor was formerly the commander of SARS in Anambra and had severally been accused of killing and maiming many youths in the state. The protesters had on Wednesday blocked the Anambra State government house and the Enugu-Onitsha expressway, insisting that Obiano must address them, but they were not addressed, leading the protesters to stay at the venue late into the night. But addressing the protesters on Thursday at the government house, Obiano said he would take their demands to President Muhammadu Buhari, while also fulfilling the ones within his power. “I am very happy with the way you have conducted yourselves. You have conducted yourself creditably.
“I have a list of all your demands. Some of them have already been met, like the SARS being disbanded. That has already been met, and some are still in the pipeline which I am going to present to the president. The other ones are the ones I can handle myself. “Your first request is immediate prosecution and removal of James Nwafor, the immediate release of all protesters in police custody, that will be done. “As for compensation of the family of SARS victims, the Attorney General and the leadership of police will look into this and make recommendations to me. I support your protest, police brutality and extortion is not allowed anywhere. Any Police that does that, quietly copy his name and let us know,” Obiano assured. The protesters who were happy about the governor’s pronouncements also marched to the popular Aroma Junction where they blocked the expressway, denying motorists access to the road. As at the time of filing this report, the protesters were still at the junction and all roads in and out of the area remained blocked.

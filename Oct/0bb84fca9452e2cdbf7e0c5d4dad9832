Chelsea goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy, has named the four Chelsea players that helped him settle in at Stamford Bridge. Mendy joined Chelsea last summer transfer window from Rennes in September. The Senegalese signed a five-year deal that will see him remain at Chelsea until 2025. The 28-year-old has already become the Blues manager, Frank Lampard’s first-choice goalkeeper. Speaking ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash against Manchester United on Saturday evening, Mendy said N’Golo Kante, Olivier Giroud and Kurt Zouma and Blues captain Cesar Azpilicueta have helped him settle at the West London club. “There are a lot of French players here that have helped me settle in such as Kurt Zouma, Olivier Giroud and N’Golo Kante,” Mendy told Chelsea’s official website. “And then there is Cesar Azpilicueta, who spent time at Marseille and can also speak French. “As soon as I arrived, he asked if there was anything he could do for me, which was really nice. “Plus there is my sister, who has lived in England for the past seven years, so I know if I need anything then I can just speak to her.”

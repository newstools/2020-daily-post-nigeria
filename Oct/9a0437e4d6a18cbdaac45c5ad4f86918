Osahon Ogie, an eyewitness said he was surprised to see hoodlums hijacking the process, thereby causing more hardship on the people. â€˜Even when we caught some thieves during the process we dealt with them accordingly but we are surprised that some very few ones have taken to the part of negativity.

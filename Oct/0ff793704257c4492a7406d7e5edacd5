The Nigerian Army has warned thugs and miscreants to desist from engaging in violent activities against peaceful Nigerians during the End SARS campaign protest across the country. The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Major General John Enenche, gave the warning in a statement on Thursday. DAILY POST recalls that this is coming after some hoodlums on Thursday attacked protesters who have been demanding an end to police brutality in Lagos State. Also, recall that armed thugs had attacked peaceful protesters in Abuja on Wednesday. The thugs armed with cutlasses and sticks had attacked protesters in Berger area of Abuja. The statement read in part: “The Armed Forces of Nigeria and other security agencies have observed with dismay some violence-related protests across the country; particularly the increasing number of attacks on peaceful protesters by thugs and miscreants. This unfolding event against peace-loving Nigerians will not be condoned. “Hence, thugs and miscreants are hereby warned to desist from engaging in violent activities against peaceful Nigerians henceforth or face appropriate measures.” “Thus, the Military High Command duly encourages peaceful citizens to go about their normal activities without fear of intimidation or harassment as the Armed Forces of Nigeria and other security agencies are on the ground for their safety.”

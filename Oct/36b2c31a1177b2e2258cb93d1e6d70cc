The lawmaker representing Amuwo Odofin constituency 1 of Lagos State, Mojisola Alli-Macaulay, has claimed most Nigerian youths are high on drugs all the time. Alli-Macaulay stated this during a plenary at the Lagos State House of Assembly on the looting and pandemonium, in the wake of the End SARS protest that was hijacked by hoodlums. She warned that the National Orientation Agency (NOA) needs to help change the attitude of the youths. The lawmaker said, “The National Orientation Agency needs to get to work. We need to begin to orientate our young people. They need people who can talk to them from time to time. “They are high on drugs all the time, most of them. They go to social media and say all sorts of things.” Alli-Macaulay argued that unemployment should not be an excuse for looting, stating that “I schooled in the UK and I saw a lot of young people who were not employed but they didn’t become hoodlums.” “They (Nigerian youths) are high on drugs all the time, most of them. They go to social media to do all sorts of things.” – Lagos lawmaker, Mojisola Alli-Macauley, on recent events in the state. pic.twitter.com/MpAkkFwSXi — Pulse Nigeria (@PulseNigeria247) October 29, 2020

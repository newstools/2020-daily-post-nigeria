The new Emir of Zazzau, Ambassador Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli, has promised to run an inclusive leadership during his reign. He also promised to ensure the unity of all within and outside his domain for the overall development of the state. Speaking shortly after his appointment as the 19th Emir of Zazzau in his palace, he assured of his willingness to ensure unity and development of the Emirate. The Emir also assured of his readiness to carry all along in affairs that pertain to the progress of the emirate. He observed that he has close relationships with the ruling houses in the emirate base on respect the houses have for each other which they all inherited among themselves apart from the blood relationship they all share. He explained that his wife is from the Katsinawa house, stressing that she is the daughter of the late Sarkin Zazzau Shehu Idris. He noted that his grandparents from his mother’s side were from the Bereberi dynasty, adding that there is no misunderstanding with any of the houses. “This is why I’m from both houses because they are the major houses in Zaria emirate,” he added. He explained that it is Allah that makes an Emir, pointing out that it is not about wealth, education or power. Ambassador Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli stressed that if it were base on wealth or power, he wouldn’t have been appointed the Emir. “Allah gives power to whom He wishes and when He wishes. We should put Allah forward in whatever we do,” he added. His contenders, he said, were not wrong to have contested for the throne as it is their rights, stressing that whoever becomes the Emir should be supported by the rest so that the people will not suffer. The Emir begged them to come together so that they can move Zazzau emirate forward. He expressed delight that some of the district heads from Katsinawa dynasty and Beriberi dynasty have come to pay homage, urging all to come to work together and assured to do his best to unite the people of Zazzau.

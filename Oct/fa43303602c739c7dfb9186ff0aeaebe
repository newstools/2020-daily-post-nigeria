The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has told its staff that they must account for all votes during the Ondo State governorship election on Saturday. INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, said this in a message to those of them that will participate in the poll. Yakubu recalled that on the eve of the Edo gubernatorial election, he appealed to INEC staff to work towards a free, fair and credible process. “Our staff members, security agencies, and other stakeholders did not spare any effort in ensuring successful conduct. Nigerians and friends of Nigeria are pleased with the outcome and we are encouraged by their commendations. “However, we cannot afford to rest on our oars. Another end-of-tenure Governorship election is upon us. There is now an even higher expectation on Ondo State.” Yakubu told INEC staff to consolidate on recent achievement and account for every vote cast on Saturday. The electoral chief urged all staff members to resist any temptation and be committed to the vision and mission of INEC in carrying out their duties during the election. He implored them to resist any form of temptation and let their individual actions be guided by extant laws and good conscience.

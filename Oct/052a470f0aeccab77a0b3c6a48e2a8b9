The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has “recovered over N11bn monetary assets in 2020”, despite the COVID-19 outbreak. The Acting Chairman of the EFCC, Mr Umar Abba, who disclosed this, also said the Commission recorded over 646 convictions within this year, NAN reports. Abba disclosed this to the Senate Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes in Abuja on Tuesday. He said Nigerians ranked the anti-graft agency higher than other law enforcement outfits in the country. A statement by EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwajaren said the anti-graft Czar also expressed displeasure over the deteriorating state of some seized vehicles. He, however, stressed that the Commission in conjunction with the Attorney General of the Federation is working towards resolving the problem. According to Abba: “The EFCC is doing remarkably well above all other law-enforcement agencies in the country and that is why the UNODC and National Bureau of Statistics in the 2017 survey they conducted ranked EFCC as the most effective government agency in Nigeria. “We are working on this challenge and I am sure the Attorney General of the Federation is coming out with a gazette so that this issue will be a thing of the past. It involves not only vehicles, but also landed properties.”

Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, aka Winners Chapel, has said that he will reject a call to become the President of Nigeria. Addressing his church yesterday, Oyedepo said he would see it as a demotion if called upon to become the country’s number ones. The cleric said that God specifically, in 1984 asked him (Oyedepo) if he was interested in becoming a President. Bishop Oyedepo said, “I’m saying it again, some are very upset about it, that’s their problem. I will consider it a demotion if I were invited to be the President of this great country. “It’s a great country, it’s a great honour for anyone to be President but that’s not where I belong. I belong to above all nations.” The cleric suggested that he is holding a position higher than that of a President because over 100 nations are hooked on a single church service conducted by him.

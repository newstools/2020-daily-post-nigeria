The Nigerian Army has warned those currently protesting to desist. A statement by the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, Col Sagir Musa, said the democracy of Nigeria would be defended at “all cost.” Stressing that the Army was loyal to President Muhammadu Buhari, Musa said they would, “deal with any situation that affect Nigeria decisively.” According to Musa: “The Nigerian Army wishes to reassure law-abiding citizens that it is highly committed to the sustenance of peace, security and defence of democracy in Nigeria. “As a responsible and law-abiding organisation, the NA reaffirms its unalloyed loyalty and commitment to the President, Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari and the Constitution of the country. “The NA hereby, warns all subversive elements and trouble makers to desist from such acts as it remains highly committed to defending the country and her democracy at all cost.” The Army’s threat is coming at the back heel of the ongoing protest against police brutality. Nigerian youths have been protesting against the illegal operations of some police units. The protest had led to the dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, and the establishment of Special Weapons and Tactics Team, SWAT.

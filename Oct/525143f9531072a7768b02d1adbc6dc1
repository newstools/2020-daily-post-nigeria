The National Examinations Council (NECO) has suspended the ongoing Senior Schools Certificate Examinations (SSCE) until further notice. This follows the escalation of the End SARS protests across the country. Although NECO managed to conduct its Economics paper on Tuesday and Physics practical on Wednesday, some states considered volatile as a result of the ongoing protests were excluded from the examinations. The exam body in a message through the Department of Examination Administration (DEA) on Wednesday, has now directed all its staff on field for the examinations to return to the office. According to NECO, “The Management and Governing Board of the National Examinations Council NECO is compelled by circumstances occasioned by the End SARS protests which led to imposition of curfews in some states thereby making it difficult for the council to move sensitive materials across the country, to put on hold papers for Thursday 22, Friday 23 and Saturday 24, October.” NECO, however, said that “the papers will be written between 17th to 19th November after computer practical paper on the 16th”. It also pointed out that “examinations will continue on the 27th of October”.

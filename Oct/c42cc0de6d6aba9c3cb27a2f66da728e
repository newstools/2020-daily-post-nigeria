Arsenal midfielder, Mesut Ozil, has offered to pay the mascot’s wages in full if the club reinstates him. The Gunners on Monday made Jerry Quy, the man inside the giant green costume, redundant after serving as the dinosaur mascot for 27 years. The club insisted the move was a necessary cost-cutting measure, with the mascot out of action as fans are not allowed into the Emirates. However, Quy may be back in a job thanks to Ozil, who has offered to pay his salary if he is brought back into the fold, while he remains an Arsenal player. Ozil posted on Instagram: “I was so sad that Jerry Quy aka our famous & loyal mascot @officialgunnersaurus and integral part of our club was being made redundant after 27 years. “As such, I’m offering to reimburse @Arsenal with the full salary of our big green guy as long as I will be an Arsenal player so Jerry can continue his job that he loves so much.” He uploaded the image with hashtags #JusticeForGunnersaurus, #M1Ö and #YaGunnersYa.

Brazil forward, Neymar, has reached out to his fellow compatriot, Ronaldo De Lima with a classy message after he surpassed the legendary striker on Brazil’s all-time goal scoring list. DAILY POST recalls that Neymar scored a hat-trick as Brazil defeated Peru 4-2 in a 2022 World Cup qualifier in Lima on Tuesday. The three goals moved the Paris Saint-Germain star into second place in his country’s all-time goal scoring list ahead of Ronaldo but behind Pele. Neymar now has 64 goals in 103 games for Brazil national team, two clear of Ronaldo’s tally of 62 goals in 98 games, while Pele has 77 goals in 92 games. Reacting, Neymar in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Tuesday night, paid tribute to Ronaldo after the match. “All my respect for you PHENOMENON,” Neymar tweeted alongside a picture of Ronaldo celebrating in Brazil’s jersey. Meanwhile, Brazil head coach, Tite, hailed Neymar’s incredible feat at his post-match press conference and declared that the 28-year-old attacker continues to improve with age. “Each historical moment of the national team, each generation, has its own value,” Tite said. “It has Ronaldo, an extraordinary phenomenon. There were Rivaldo, Romario, Bebeto. Each had their times. It’s unfair to make comparisons between them. “What I can say is that Neymar has this unpredictability. He is a bow and arrow. “He is the player for the assist and the finish too, and he gets better and better and with an increasing degree of maturity.”

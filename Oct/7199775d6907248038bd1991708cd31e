A soldier identified as Omoh F. has been arrested for assaulting a lady in Lagos. The incident occurred at an ATM gallery of the United Bank for Africa (UBA) in Oshodi on Monday. He had jumped queue and after a lady complained, Omoh hit her with his belt. The military man has been detained and an investigation has commenced. The victim narrated her ordeal via her Twitter handle, @vels20. “I was just assaulted by an army official this morning, the 26/10/2020 at the ATM stand of UBA at their Oshodi branch…I’m also scared of writing this because he threatened me. My life is your hands Nigerians. I was in the ATM queue and this army official asked me to move so he could pass. I asked him if he was in the queue that there is a queue, he asked me to move. “I moved and continued asking him if he was in the queue. He flared up as you will see in the video below, and before I knew what happened he brought out his belt and hit me. I never insulted him. He threatened to make me bleed in my own country because I asked if he was in the queue. I want justice”, she tweeted. Local and international groups have repeatedly accused the Nigeria military of assault on civilians. The Army is already facing global condemnation for the use of force against peaceful End SARS protesters. Soldiers marched to the Lekki toll gate on October 20 and opened fire on unarmed civilians. The ATM attack happened amid the agitation against police brutality. Video: pic.twitter.com/rpwtN0VVeT — ADA-OMA😍😍😍 (@vels20) October 26, 2020

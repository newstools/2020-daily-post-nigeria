Former Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Anita Natacha Akide, popularly known as Tacha” has suggested that the Presidential Panel set up to oversee the demands of the End SARS protesters should have young vibrant Nigerian youths in it. DAILY POST had reported that following the nationwide protest against police brutality, the Presidency formed a panel to reform the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). It also said that the panel has approved the five-point demand from Nigerians, who have been protesting across the country since last week. However, Tacha in a video via her Twitter account said that panel which constitutes old recycled leaders should also have sharp thinking Nigerian youths in it. She further explained that those old leaders who made up the Presidential panel wouldn’t understand the pains Nigerians go through because they have never experienced it before. “We are doing great. I never thought that a day like this will come when Nigerians will be this United. “Whether you are out there protesting on the streets or online retweeting, we are all doing great. “But guys we need a plan.what is the plan, 5 for 5 is being met in Lagos another question is, is 5 for 5 been met in Plateau, Cross-River, Abuja and other states in the country. “We have 36 states in this country make them no de do like say na only one state de Nigeria. “We need a plan. A panel has been set up by the government and we need Nigerian youths in that panel. “We need people that can relate to our pains in that panel, not the same old recycled leaders who can’t relate to our pains. “They can’t relate to our pains, they can’t relate to hunger, they have never starved before and they have never shot their siblings or family members before so they can never relate. “We need Nigerians, young Nigerians who understand this movement in that panel. They cannot be saying a maximum of six months for something that can be sorted and done if we have smart Nigerian youths in that panel in a couple of weeks,” she said.

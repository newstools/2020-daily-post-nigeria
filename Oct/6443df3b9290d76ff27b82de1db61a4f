President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed his sadness over Senator Yushau Anka’s death. Anka passed away on Monday and was buried in Abuja on Tuesday. Buhari’s condolence message was conveyed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu. “Righteousness was his chosen path. Senator Anka was a towering statesman. As a politician, he was respected across political party divisions by all sections of the society. “May Allah grant him eternal rest,” the statement read. Anka represented the Zamfara West constituency from 1999 to 2007 and famously opposed Olusegun Obasanjo’s attempt at tenure elongation efforts in 2006.

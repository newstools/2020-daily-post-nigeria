The Chairman of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Enugu State chapter, Bishop Godwin Madu has called for restraint as the situation worsens across the country over the End SARS protest. This came amidst the killing of unarmed protesters in Lagos on Tuesday night. In a statement he issued in Enugu, Madu condemned all forms of brutality and killing of innocent citizens. He said, “the maiming and brutalising of our citizens is a dreadful part of the ‘old’ and a strong violation of our fundamental human rights which ought not to be condoned or tolerated. “We are well aware and duly acknowledge the few upright and patriotic officers of the Nigeria Police Force who have fought tirelessly to distinguish themselves in their pursuit of justice and fairness. “In the wake of this seeming revival of our beloved nation via several prayer walks and peaceful protests, we urge the government to lend a listening ear and show glaring concern to the needs of the Nigerian youth. “We also implore our youths to continually tow the path of peace even in these times as this is not a violent or vengeful mission but a peaceful demand for a new Nigeria. “Our hearts go out to all who have suffered one form of loss or another in the hands of unscrupulous conformists. May God grant you all the fortitude to bear those irreparable losses. “May we be reminded that this is no longer a season of wishful thinking but a season to be deliberate. Deliberate about a new, reformed and rebranded Nigeria. “We will continue to pray for our beloved nation and declare the immutable counsel of God over our land and our children. We decree and declare wisdom for our leaders, safety and security on our streets and an unwavering peace across cultures and tribes, strata and spheres in Jesus Name”.

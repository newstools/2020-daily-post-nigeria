At only 13, she had to deal with police brutality. Complaints were made and nothing was done. “No one is spared and we are all affected. Mr President, this is the current state of your country. What our country is today is a reflection of your leadership, your legacy. “I’m getting weary and tired of being optimistic about change but even then can’t complain. “Mr President, I urge you to speak to us because we are not mind readers. Your house is not in order and way far from stable. The people aren’t being empowered, neither are they being protected. We are not all criminals and should not be treated as such.”<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847190" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-11-1.jpg" alt="" width="1190" height="2048" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-11-1.jpg 1190w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-11-1-174x300.jpg 174w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-11-1-595x1024.jpg 595w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-11-1-893x1536.jpg 893w" sizes="(max-width: 1190px) 100vw, 1190px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-847191" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-10-1.jpg" alt="" width="1235" height="2048" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-10-1.jpg 1235w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-10-1-181x300.jpg 181w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-10-1-618x1024.jpg 618w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/unnamed-10-1-926x1536.jpg 926w" sizes="(max-width: 1235px) 100vw, 1235px">

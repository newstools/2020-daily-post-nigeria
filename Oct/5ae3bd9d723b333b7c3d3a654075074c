Barcelona winger, Ousmane Dembele, is now reconsidering his desire to remain at the club after they began talks with Manchester United over a possible deal, RAC1 reports. The Red Devils want to sign the 23-year-old on a season-long loan. United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, sees Dembele as an alternative to Jadon Sancho, who looks set to stay at Borussia Dortmund this season. Dortmund has insisted all summer that Sancho would not leave except United pay €120 million (£109.6m). Dembele was intent on staying at Barcelona for at least another season, despite interest from United and Liverpool. But the France forward is ready to make a U-turn and leave the Camp Nou, following Barca’s decision to enter negotiations with United over a potential deal. United want to sign Dembele on loan with an option to buy next summer, but Barcelona’s preference is to sell him to fund moves for Memphis Depay and Manchester City defender, Eric Garcia.

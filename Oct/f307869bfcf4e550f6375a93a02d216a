Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has revealed that the penalty taker row has been “dealt with” both on the pitch and the dressing room, after Tammy Abraham tried to get the ball from Jorginho. Abraham was keen to get his name on the scoresheet, as the Blues bounced back from recent poor results, with a 4-0 win over Crystal Palace on Saturday. With Chelsea 3-0 up, the England striker picked up the ball after a spot-kick was awarded, but captain Cesar Azpilicueta ushered him away as Jorginho scored his second penalty of the game. His two penalties followed goals from Ben Chilwell and Kurt Zouma. “It’s been dealt with in the dressing room, it’s been dealt with,” Lampard told BT Sport after the match. “I want leaders and I don’t mind a bit of conflict if Tammy wanted to take it because he wants a goal or whatever and gets put in his place a little bit. “I appreciate his eagerness because his performance deserved a goal but those are the rules you don’t jump ahead of the list unless we’re so comfortable and someone is on a hat-trick and I decide.”

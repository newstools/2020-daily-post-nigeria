US President, Donald Trump, has said he might leave the country if he does not win the upcoming presidential election. The poll is scheduled for November 3. Trump, who is the Republican candidate, will contest against former vice-president and Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Speaking during his campaign rally in Georgia this weekend, Trump said he won’t feel so good losing to “the worst candidate in the history of politics”. He said: “I shouldn’t joke because you know what? Running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics puts pressure on me. “Could you imagine if I lose? My whole life, what am I going to do? I’m going to say ‘I lost to the worst candidate in the history of politics.’ I’m not going to feel so good. “Maybe I’ll have to leave the country? I don’t know.”

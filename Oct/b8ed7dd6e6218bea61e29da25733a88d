The meeting was held to address issues around the End SARS protest and its fallouts. According to Ikpeazu: “We have decided to collectively pursue youth-friendly programs that will lead to massive job creation in our respective states taking the peculiarities of each state into account! “For us in Abia, apart from the initial 7 agro allied cottage industries coming to 7 LGAs, the state will target another factory akin to the Enyimba automated shoe company. On security, Ikpeazu said: “We are committed to ensuring the safety of all citizens within our domains irrespective of their ethnic nationalities. “In Abia, we already set up a Ministry of Homeland Security to complement the efforts of the police and as another way of creating employment for and meaningfully engaging our youths. “In addition, our Homeland Security outfit which has already trained hundreds of our youths and made them ready for deployment, will continue to devise means of collaborating with relevant security agencies and enlist the support of citizens to continue to protect our fatherland.”

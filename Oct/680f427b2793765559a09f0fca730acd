Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, on Friday provided the latest team news update ahead of his side’s away Premier League clash against Newcastle United on Saturday night. Solskjaer said Harry Maguire is a doubt for Newcastle clash after he sustained a knock during England’s UEFA Nations League’s 1-0 defeat to Denmark on Wednesday. According to him, Alex Telles is resting following a flight back from South America, after his participation in the World Cup qualifiers, while Facundo Pellistri will not play against Newcastle because he is a player for the future. Solskjaer’s men were defeated 6-1 against Tottenham Hotspurs in their previous Premier League encounter at Old Trafford before the international break. “Harry seemed to pick up a little knock just before he got sent off,” Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference as quoted by Man United’s official website. “So we’re having a look at him today to see how he is. “You never know [how players are injury wise] until they get back, and we have had a look at them. I think, and we hope everyone has come through, okay. Of course, Alex has travelled all around the world. He flew overnight and got here on Thursday.” “Pellistri is a young boy coming from Uruguay,” he added. “It’s the tradition we have here where we want to bring young players in and let them grow and develop and become the player they can be. “Of course we will give him time. He’s more one for the future than now, but he’s exciting, and he’s shown some things in training that we don’t really have here. I’m looking forward to helping him develop and helping him settle.”

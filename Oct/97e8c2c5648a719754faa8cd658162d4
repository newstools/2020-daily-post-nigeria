FA Cup champions, Arsenal, will be without their left-back, Kieran Tierney, when they tackle Manchester City in the Premier League on October 17 at Etihad after the international break. Tierney required self-isolation for fourteen days after coming into contact with Southampton’s Stuart Armstrong. The Scotland national team confirmed this on Wednesday that Tierney and Celtic’s Ryan Christie had been in close contact with Armstrong, who has contracted coronavirus (COVID-19). Tierney’s quarantine began on Tuesday, but it means the 23-year-old star will not be able to report to Arsenal’s training base until after the clash with Man City. Armstrong was the only player in the Scotland squad to test positive for the virus despite having initially tested negative after reporting for international duty on Monday. His diagnosis emerged on Wednesday after a supplementary UEFA test came back positive, with the midfielder is now self-isolating for ten days from Tuesday. Armstrong, Tierney and Christie will miss their country’s Euro 2020 play-off semi-final against Israel as well as Nations League games against Slovakia and Czech Republic respectively. Reacting to the development, Scotland coach, Steve Clarke said, “While this is obviously a piece of disappointing news, the most important thing is the health and safety of the individuals involved and the wider group. “We have informed the respective clubs from whom we have borrowed the players and backroom staff, and we now have to prepare for a huge match ahead tomorrow.”

A passenger boat travelling from Port Harcourt to Bille in Degema Local Government Area of Rivers State has been attacked by suspected sea pirates. DAILY POST gathered that one Tamuno Kemuel, a father of six, lost his life in the attack, while valuables of other passengers and a speedboat were carted away by the pirates. Asatubo Igbanibo Kemuel, a former Chairman of Bille Kingdom Community Development Committee, told newsmen that the attack occurred on Sunday. Kemuel said the incident which has left one person dead and several others missing, calls for concerted action from relevant stakeholders, especially, the security agencies to smoke out the criminals. He called on, “The Rivers State Government and security operatives to spread their tentacles and put a stop to the excesses of sea pirates”, saying that pirate’ activities are now regular due to the absence of security checks. The Rivers State Police Command is yet to confirm the incident. Insecurity on the waterways has remained a huge challenge in the Niger-Delta with incessant reports of attacks on small islands and communities in the creeks of the region by armed men Another attack was reported over a week ago when armed men invaded a fishing port in Ngo in Andoni Local government area of Rivers State where the hoodlums made away with boat engines belonging to fishermen in the area.

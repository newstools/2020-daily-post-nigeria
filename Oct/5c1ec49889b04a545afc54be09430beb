The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN), Kano State, branch has assured the public of its commitment to ensure adequate fuel supply to all the states under the Kano zone to prevent possible scarcity as a result of End SARS protest, which disrupted distribution. The IPMAN chairman in Kano, Alhaji Bashir Dan-Malam, gave the assurance on Wednesday, while speaking to newsmen after inspecting the loading of product at the Kano depot after the End SARS protest, which compelled its members to suspend their activities. He said there was no need for motorists and other members of the public to engage in panic buying of the commodity as the association was committed to transporting the product to all states under Kano including Katsina, Bauchi, Yobe and Jigawa. He said IPMAN would continue to support the Federal Government to ensure uninterrupted fuel supply across the nooks and crannies of the country. He commended the Managing Director of Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC), Alhaji Lawal Musa for directing various depots in the country to resume operation after the End SARS protest across the country. He noted that introduction of the ‘Online Solution’ popularly known as ‘PPMC Customer Express Portal’ by the Pipelines and Products Marketing Company had eliminated all the stress marketers used to experience while carrying out their business. “The new technology introduced by the PPMC gives customers the opportunity to transact their business online without any stress in addition the online solution will allow PPMC to serve you faster and better, within the confines of your homes or offices,” Dan-Malam said. The IPMAN chairman commended the Management of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) under the leadership of Mele Kyari for his commitment to ensure accountability and transparency in the oil and gas industry.

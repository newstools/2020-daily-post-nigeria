Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has revealed what he told Lionel Messi about Luis Suarez’s exit from the club this summer. Koeman, speaking to NOS, said Suarez could have stayed at the Camp Nou, but it was the club’s decision to let him leave. The 33-year-old striker went on to join Atleti for £5m, after a potential move to Juventus broke down. Suarez enjoyed six successful years at the Nou Camp, winning a Champions League and four LaLiga titles. Messi was especially critical of Barcelona’s handling of Suarez’s departure and Koeman revealed he has discussed the matter with him. He said: “If you have someone in the locker room with whom you and your wife and children also hang out outside football, then such a reaction makes sense. “I also said that to Messi: “I understand that you are disappointed and think it is a terrible shame that he is leaving, but these are choices of the club”.’

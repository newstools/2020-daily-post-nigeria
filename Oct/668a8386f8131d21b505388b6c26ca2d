The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Thursday declared that its sit-at-home order was a success across the Southeast. Recall that IPOB had ordered people in the Southeast and Southwest to sit-at-home on October 1, due to marginalization of the Southeast and bad governance. However, the group said the success of the sit-at-home was an indication that the Southeast was ready for the actualisation of Biafra. The separatist group insisted that residents of Abia, Ebonyi, Anambra, Imo, Delta and Rivers State complied with the order. A statement by IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful said: “Today’s Sit at home order issued by the global movement of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) on October 1, 2020, is totally successful in so many states and cities in Biafraland. “All states in Biafraland complied on the order, Abia State, Rivers State, Ebonyi State, Anambra State, Imo State, Delta State and other states in Biafraland. “The compliance of this order is to showcase our readiness for the speedy coming of Biafra freedom and independence.”

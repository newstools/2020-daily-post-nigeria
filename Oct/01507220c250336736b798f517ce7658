Salihu Tanko Yakasai, the media aide to Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has given his observations from the wedding ceremony of son of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate in the 2019 general elections, Atiku Abubakar, and the daughter of a former Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Nuhu Ribadu. The event held on Saturday in Asokoro, Abuja. Political differences were put aside as PDP chieftains and those from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) attended the wedding ceremony. Atiku, who is a PDP top shot, hosted the National Leader of the APC, Bola Tinubu; the caretaker National Chairman of the APC, Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State and his Kano and Kaduna States counterparts, Ganduje and Nasir El-Rufai respectively. Yakassai, writing on his Twitter page, said: “I sat at a vantage point during the Atiku/Ribadu children’s wedding and saw several key actors in almost all the major current political feuds in both APC and PDP walked and sat together joyfully without bitterness. “Let us emulate them and agree to disagree amicably.”

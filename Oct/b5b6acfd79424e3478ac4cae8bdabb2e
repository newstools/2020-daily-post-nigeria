Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has queried the shooting of protesters at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos State on Tuesday. Tinubu said he asked the state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on who ordered the shooting at Lekki toll gate. He disclosed this after a meeting with Sanwo-Olu at the state’s Government House in Alausa. Speaking with journalists after the meeting, Tinubu said: “if he didn’t order the attack, who ordered the attack? That’s all I needed from him.” The former Lagos State governor had also called for a thorough investigation into the attack. He added: “First, we have to segregate the calendar – those who suffered casualty before the protests from the hands of SARS. You have to separate that from those who suffered casualty due to what happened at the toll gate. “For those who suffered casualty from SARS, the Commission of Inquiry that is already set up will unearth that and will make their recommendations. I trust the calibre and the character of the people there, they are independent. That is one.” Tinubu had come under attack since the shooting at Lekki Toll Gate.

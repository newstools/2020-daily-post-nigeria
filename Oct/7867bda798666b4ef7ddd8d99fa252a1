Some students, parents, and other Nigerians have been left stranded over the inability to access major roads in Abuja. This follows protests calling for the end of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, unit of the police, which has intensified despite government’s announcement of its disbandment. DAILY POST reports that End SARS protesters had at 7:00 a.m. blocked the highway preventing vehicular movement. The roads are Dutse/Bwari road, AYA, amongst others. Some parents told DAILY POST that they had to shut down their business before the close of school because of the road blockage. A store owner, Jerena Nwalozie, expressed displeasure over her inability to pick her kids from school after hours on the road. “It took me three hours to drive from Ushafa to Dutse, this is supposed to be less than an hour journey but I still have not reached my Kids at school. “This is pathetic, I support the protest and I am against police brutality but this road block is affecting innocent children.” Another parent, Eddie Ekanem told this reporter that he picked his kids from school but has been in traffic for over two hours. ”Roadblock has never been this serious since I started plying the route, my kids snd hungry and tired but we cannot even move from this spot for a while now. ”I think the protesters should rethink their strategy, locking major roads is unfair to innocent citizens. Some school children were also seen trekking back home as there were no vehicles to convey them. This has forced residents to embark on long treks to get to their various destinations. #EndSARS : Students stranded as protesters block Dutse/Bwari road , #Abuja . #ilorinprotest #EndSARSImmediately #EndPoliceBrutalitynow #SideWithNigeria #sorosoke247 pic.twitter.com/aRtMNb8fXM — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) October 19, 2020

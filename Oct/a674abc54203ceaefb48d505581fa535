Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, on Saturday, led other state officials to cut grasses at Mount Carmel College in Ilorin. The exercise was ahead of school resumption on Monday, NAN reports. AbdulRazaq noted that his action was meant to inspire people to take responsibilities for government’s facilities located in their areas. The governor arrived the school with a cutlass, accompanied by House of Assembly leader, Magaji Olawoyin, and Chairman, Environmental Task Force, AbdulRazaq Jiddah. AbdulRazaq later inspected parts of the school affected by recent rainstorm. “The message here is to emphasise self-helps and community contributions to public projects. When government locates a project in your community, such a community should take ownership. “My being here is to send the signal that nobody is too big to be involved in community work; we need to help ourselves. It is really no big deal to make things work”, he said.

Mikel Arteta will face his former employers on Saturday when he takes his Arsenal side to the Eastland’s to face Manchester City. Arsenal had a horrible record against the Citizens in the League over recent years. But they beat them in the FA Cup semi-final last season and will go into this weekend sitting 10 places above Pep Guardiola’s men with five points separating them, having played a game more. Here DAILY POST takes a look at how Mikel Arteta could set up the visitors for the contest. Absent: Pablo Mari (ankle), Calum Chambers (knee) Shkodran Mustafi (hamstring), Gabriel Martinelli (knee). Possible: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (ankle) Kieran Tierney (coronavirus) Emile Smith Rowe (shoulder). The major question mark under Arsenal’s consideration for squad selection surrounds captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang who excused himself during the international break due to a sprained ankle. Though he expected to recover in time for this one as he searched for his first Premier League goal against the Citizens. He played more Premier League matches without finding the net against City than he has done against any other opponent. But he did score a brace in one of his recent meetings to fire Bernd Leno, Hector Bellerin, David Luiz, Gabriel Magalhães, Kieran Tierney. Thomas Partey, Daniel Ceballos, Bukayo Saka, Willian, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette.

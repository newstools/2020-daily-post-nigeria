The British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, has reacted to the #EndSARS protests going on all over the country. In a tweet from her verified handle, she noted that “peaceful protests are powerful”. Laing also said that the recently passed Police Act by President Muhammadu Buhari, should provide a good foundation for accountable community police force. “Significant protests over #SARS demonstrating Nigerian people’s desire for police reform. Peaceful protests are powerful. “The Police Act recently passed by @MBuhari provides a good foundation to build a more accountable community police force,” Laing wrote.

Former Ekiti Governor, Ayo Fayose, Wednesday night, reacted to the removal of his cap in Ondo State. The incident occured at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rally in Ondo town. Fayose was walking to the podium at the campaign ground when someone he called a “hoodlum” removed his cap. In a statement by his spokesman, Lere Olayinka, he alleged that Oyo Governor, Seyi Makinde, and ex-PDP Deputy National Chairman, Bode George, were the mastermind. Fayose vowed that he won’t stop saying the truth about the party in the Southwest. He declared that those who have failed to produce any result in Lagos State since 1999 will be made to retire. Fayode announced that he will make a formal report of the incident to security agencies and the party. “That’s how late Chief Bola Ige’s cap was removed in Ile Ife, Osun State and we all know what happened later. This one will not be ignored and treated as one of those things. The masterminds had it all planned and they followed it up by celebrating what they saw as the success of their plot. They even capped it up by circulating the video. “It was not an accident. Those who planned it only succeeded in advertising their political myopism because popularity of the brand Ayo Fayose, Osokomole, cannot be rubbished by such childish act. They must have seen the reaction of the people at the rally. They know that they can’t get such loud ovation even if they spend all the money in this world. “As for me, I am unperturbed and I must say it clearly that those new comers to the PDP and their old allies, who won’t mind soiling the image of the party to achieve their aims, will not be allowed to succeed,” Fayose said. @mrlurvy this is the Fayose video The person didn't complete the cap removal.

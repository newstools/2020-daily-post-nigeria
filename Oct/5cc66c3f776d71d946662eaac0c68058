Former Niger Delta militant leader, Alhaji Asari Dokubo has called on people of the region to shun the protests against police brutality and scrapping of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, and focus on the reinvention of the Sovereign State of Biafra. In a Facebook post on Sunday, Asari addressed people of Niger Delta participating in the nationwide protests, which he said is a waste of time. According to the ex-warlord, there is nothing to restructure about Nigeria, insisting that it is a waste of time cooperating with the Yorubas in the #ENDSARS protests, adding that the only solution for Niger Deltans is to team together with the Ogonis and the Igbos and Efiks and reinvent Biafra. He said this was because nobody can oppress the Ijaw man in Biafra. Asari said that what the people need at the moment is political freedom and every other thing will come at the right time, “because you will control and hold your oil,” he said. “Anything else is not going to work unless we stand up and fight for Biafra. Anybody talking about restructuring, Niger Delta republic or an Igbo Biafra is an enemy of our people because Biafra most surely come whether you like it or not.”

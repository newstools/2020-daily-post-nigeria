The Nigerian Bar Association, Bori branch in Rivers State, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the alleged violation of federal character principle at the Nigeria Copyright Commission, NCC. The branch chairman, Ledum Finor- Puene in a letter sighted by DAILY POST on Saturday said there was a gross violation of the Federal Character Principle as enshrined in section 14 (3) of the Nigeria’s constitution as amended. Puene explained that four members of the governing board of the NCC were from the same state. “This letter is premised on the fact that in consideration of the federal character principle, four members of the governing board of the Nigerian Copyright Commission, NCC, are from the same state of origin ( Edo State) namely; 1. Mrs Towo Autin-Odigie 2. Comrade Salisu Othman 3. Mr John Asein 4. Rev Bayo Awala “This act is selfish, unpatriotic and offends the provision of our constitution. It was for this purpose, avoiding this mischief that the Federal Character principle was enshrined in section 14 (3) (Supra)” Puene, therefore, urged Buhari to use his good offices and powers of appointment conferred on him to redress, investigate and correct the appointment. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-852820 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_8406-576x1024.jpg.webp" alt="" width="576" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_8406-576x1024.jpg.webp 576w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_8406-169x300.jpg.webp 169w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_8406.jpg.webp 750w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px">

Former Manchester United striker, Robin van Persie, has predicted that the club’s new signing, Edinson Cavani, will improve the likes of Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood at Old Trafford. Van Persie, who said that Cavani would turn out to be a “brilliant signing” for Man United, also joked he played a part in the striker’s transfer to the Red Devils after talking up a move for the Uruguay star back in February. Cavani joined Man United on Monday night (transfer deadline day) as a free agent after ending his seven-year spell with Paris Saint-Germain this summer. The 33-year-old forward signed a one-year contract with an option for a further year. Cavani was one of five players to join Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this summer, with Donny van de Beek, Alex Telles, Amad Diallo and Facundo Pellistri also completing moves to the Premier League giants. Reacting to the development, Van Persie wrote on Twitter on Tuesday, “Agent RVP. Glad to see you were listening, Manchester United,” “Brilliant signing and adds plenty of experience. “Will improve players around him even more Martial, Rashford Greenwood GoalMachine.”

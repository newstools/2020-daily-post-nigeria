A former Shooting Stars and Kano Pillars’ attacking midfielder, Tony Edjomariegwe has joined other Nigerians in the End SARS campaign by narrating his encounter with officers of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS). Edjomariegwe who currently plays in Morocco with Moghreb Tétouan, in a post via his Facebook account said SARS officials demanded for $1,000 from him when he was in the country last year for holidays. He further disclosed that the officials allegedly made the demand after describing him a, “suspect”. “I remembered last year I came back and was stopped by SARS, and they told me I was a suspect asking me to call my coach, captain and president of my team. “They even asked me which police station I reported to when I came into the country. “Even after seeing all evidence of me and my job on youtube and google, they still took me to a police station and asked me to come behind the station while smoking all sorts of stuffs weeds. “They also asked me to pay $1000. It’s so pathetic and annoying seeing the harassment, extortion and killings. “We nor do again oga president. End SARS Now,” he said.

The Nigeria Union of journalists, Osun State Council, has expressed displeasure over the attack on the Osun State Broadcasting Corporation (OSBC) by hoodlums. A statement by the Chairman of the Union, Comrade Wasiu Ajadosu, and his Secretary, Comrade Bukola Elufadejin, asserted that the Union could no longer tolerate senseless attacks on its members who are performing their lawful duties. The statement noted that it was unfortunate that some criminals, despite the curfew declared by the state government, would lay siege on the state broadcasting house and destroy the property of the corporation. It maintained that if the state government could no longer guarantee safety of its members, Journalists in the state will not have the option than to stay at home until the ongoing civil unrest is resolved. The statement further said that the union is still embittered with the attack on a member, Toyin Yusuf, on Saturday and called on the hoodlums who have taken advantage of peaceful protesters to cause mayhem in the state to stop their hostilities against journalists as media remains the tool through which their agitations can reach those in position of authority. It urged genuine protesters to redefine their agitations as their gains of the past twelve days might be defeated by activities of miscreants parading themselves as protesters. “We were taken aback with the latest attack on OSBC Station on Wednesday, after a member of the union was callously brutalised on Saturday by these marauding hoodlums parading themselves as protesters. “While we are in support of any democratic agitation to bring about egalitarian and just society, as an harbinger of democratic ethos and liberty, we implicitly frown at acts of criminality and arson. “It should be noted that the union may have no other option than to
call its members from the field until this crisis comes to a convincing end if the state fails to provide necessary security for its members”, the statement said.

Manchester United star, Donny van de Beek, has sent a clear message to the club’s manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, over his lack of regular playing time ahead of the Red Devils’ Premier League clash against Arsenal on Sunday. Solskjaer sanctioned a £40 million deal for Van de Beek in the last summer transfer window. Van de Beek is yet to start for Man United in the Premier League this season since he joined the Old Trafford club from Ajax. The Netherlands international did start in Man United’s Champions League 5-0 win against RB Leipzig on Wednesday, but he was taken off midway through the second half during the encounter. However, the 23-year-old midfielder has now insisted that he wants to always feature for Man United as they host Arsenal this weekend. “Players always want to play games. Training is also nice, but the games… this is why you are playing football,” Van de Beek was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “I think a lot of games [means] we can improve always and I am sure that we will win more if we stay in focus. “Arsenal has shown that they have really good players, and I mean we need to be focused. We won [against RB Leipzig], and everybody is happy, and it’s good for the confidence and everything, but now we must go on to that game. “A lot of big games are coming up now. We need to stay in focus, and then I’m sure that we make more nice wins.”

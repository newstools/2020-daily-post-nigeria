Former Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, on Monday, distanced himself from his latest 2023 campaign posters. DAILY POST over the weekend reported the emergence of Atiku’s 2023 presidential campaign posters on social media. The said campaign posters presented the former Vice President as a unifier of Nigeria. However, the former Vice President said he was focused on ensuring the PDP wins the upcoming governorship election in Ondo State. This was exclusively disclosed to DAILY POST by the former Vice President’s Media Aide, Paul Ibe. According to Ibe: “The last time I spoke about this issue, I said Atiku was currently preoccupied with the Edo, Ondo election and thankfully, we are done with the Edo election and it was a victory for the PDP. “Now Atiku Abubakar and other stakeholders of the party are focused on the Ondo election, and all these elections are important because it strengthens the party ahead of 2023. “This is not the preoccupation of Atiku right now, and he’s not about 2023. “By the way, even if Atiku will run for the presidency, it won’t be via a poster, so let’s not jump the gun by putting the cart before the horse, let’s deal with the current issue of which Ondo is just around the corner.”

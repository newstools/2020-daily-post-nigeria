Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta and the club’s sporting director, Edu, disagreed over if to sign Thomas Partey or Houssem Aouar, L’Equipe reports. It is understood that Partey who eventually arrived from Atletico Madrid on transfer deadline day, was Edu’s choice. However, Arteta wanted more creativity in the middle and preferred Aouar. But Edu’s decision “obviously had more weight”. Partey, 27, has made three appearances already for Arsenal. The Gunners did try several times to land Aouar from Lyon, but all their offers were rejected. One of their bids included a player-plus-cash deal, which would have seen Matteo Guendouzi return to France.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday charged Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to act on the aphorism that “to whom much is given, much more is expected”. PDP also urged Yakubu to immediately look into issues that aid manipulations, rigging, violence and inconclusive elections which marred most of the exercises conducted in his previous tenure. The party stated this while reacting to Yakubu’s reappointment as Chairman of the INEC. DAILY POST recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday re-appointed Prof. Mahmood Yakubu as the Chairman of the INEC. Reacting to the development, PDP in a tweet via its Twitter handle wrote: “The @OfficialPDPNig notes the reappointment of Professor Mahmood Yakubu as the Chairman of the @inecnigeria by President @MBuhari. “Professor Yakubu must be mindful of the aphorism that “to whom much is given, much more is expected”. “His reappointment, therefore, comes with a lot of expectations by Nigerians. He must quickly take a painstaking look into issues that aid manipulations, rigging, violence and inconclusive elections which marred most of the exercises conducted in his previous tenure.”

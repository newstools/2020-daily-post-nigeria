The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Governors will converge in Ondo State on Wednesday. They will attend Eyitayo Jegede’s campaign grand finale in Akure. The PDP governorship candidate will slug it out against Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The third major candidate in the race is Ajayi Agboola, the Deputy Governor. Agboola is the flagbearer of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) led by former Governor, Segun Mimiko. Expected on the PDP governors’ delegation is Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike. The political strategist was the party’s National Campaign Council Chairman for the Edo governorship election. Wike was a thorn in APC’s flesh. On the eve of the poll, the police barricaded the hotel he stayed in. Days after PDP’s victory in Edo, Akeredolu dared Wike. He declared that Ondo is not where his Rivers counterpart can flex his muscles. In reaction, Wike told Akeredolu that he would enter Ondo if he wished. The PDP governors will be led to the state by National Campaign Council Chairman and Oyo Governor, Seyi Makinde. Former Kano Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, and a number of opposition stalwarts are already in town.

The Federal Government has appealed to members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), to endorse Nigeria’s nomination, Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, to become its Director-General. Minister of State for Industry, Trade and Investment, Mrs Mariam Katagum, stated this while speaking to reporters in Abuja on Thursday. Katagum described Okonjo-Iweala as “the best choice for the job”. She also appreciated the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the European Union (EU) for backing Okonjo-Iweala. “The WTO currently faces a lot of problems and confronting these challenges necessarily requires building trust among the membership especially as the problems are not solely of a technical nature. “Only a DG with the requisite political and negotiating skills coupled with multilateral experience, can ensure deep engagement of the Members in order to restore trust and build a truly efficient organisation. “Dr Iweala’s qualities and experience in managing multilateral issues, in trade facilitation and negotiation, as well as brokering deals and agreements with high political stakes, put her in good standing,” Katagum said.

The Osun State Commissioner for Information, Funke Egbemode, has said that what happened at the protest ground in Osogbo, the State capital on Saturday was a premeditated attempt to assassinate Governor Gboyega Oyetola. DAILY POST reported on Saturday that thugs attacked Governor Oyetola while he addressed protesters in Osogbo. This was as the Governor walked along with the EndSARS protesters from Oke-fia to join others at popular Olaiya junction. The suspected hoodlums launched an attack on the crowd, killing one person while several others sustained injuries. The Commissioner, who was also at the scene, told reporters that the attack was beyond the #EndSARS protest, insisting that the attackers were not protesters. “It was an assassination attempt,” she said. “The people who launched the attack were not protesters at all. “It was not a spontaneous attempt. The attackers had it all planned. They had guns and other weapons. “It was simply a street coup to take out the governor, his deputy and the secretary to the state government,” she stated

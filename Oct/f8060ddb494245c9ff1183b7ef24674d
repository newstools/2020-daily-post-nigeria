The National Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, has urged the electorate in Ondo State to stay firmly with their votes and kick against any attempt to rig the Oct 10, governorship election. Secondus said this on Saturday in Ondo town at the PDP grand finale rally ahead of the Oct. 10 governorship election. According to the PDP Chairman, Akeredolu government was afraid and intimidated of Eyitayo Jegede’s popularity, probably that was enough reason they destroyed the road that links to our campaign ground. “I quite understand the political tension in the state is high now and the only way to reduce it is to allow INEC and security operatives to do their job professionally without any bias and allow people’s vote to count. “Our people must stop the APC government from rigging this coming election, don’t allow them to manipulate your vote, it is your right,” he said. Secondus also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to demonstrate good leadership by ensuring that the free and fair election conducted in the Edo governorship election is being replicated in the coming Saturday polls in Ondo State. “Like I always say in any political gathering that the only legacy President Buhari can at least give the country now is to maintain and replicate the credible election conducted in Edo in Ondo State.

Ayodele Fayose, erstwhile Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has charged President Muhammadu Buhari to resign from office. Fayose anchored his call on claims that Nigeria currently has nothing to celebrate as it marks its 60th anniversary. A statement by his spokesman, Lere Olayinka quoted Fayose as insisting that Buhari’s resignation was the only thing that would make Nigerians happy as the country marks its 60th independence anniversary. He also maintained that Nigeria was currently in coma and life support. The statement forwarded to DAILY POST reads: “The only thing that will give Nigerians unspeakable joy as the country turns 60 will be the announcement of the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari. “The country is presently in coma and on life-support, there is nothing to celebrate in a country bedevilled with insecurity, hunger, bare-faced corruption and bad governance. “President Buhari’s resignation will serve as a life-restoring parting gift for Nigerians.”

A Pastor, Uche Macldurence, appeared before a Grade 1 Area Court in Kubwa, on Tuesday, for issuing a threat. 38-year-old Macldurence who resides at NEPA Road, off Gado Nasko Road in Kubwa pleaded not guilty to a one-count charge of criminal intimidation. Prosecuting counsel, Babajide Olanipekun, said the matter was reported at Kubwa Police Station by one Anthony Igokwe of Tugo Road phase 4, Kubwa. Macldurence and the complainant had a misunderstanding during which the pastor threatened “to deal with” the complainant. The utterance contravenes the laws of Nigeria. Defendant’s counsel, Dan Nwobodo, applied for bail and assured that the defendant would not elope. The judge, Muhammad Adamu, admitted Macldurence to bail in the sum of N200,000, with a surety in like sum. The surety is expected to present valid means of identification and must reside within the court’s jurisdiction. The case was adjourned to November 9 for hearing.

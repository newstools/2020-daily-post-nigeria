The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has called on the Federal Government to urgently address the concerns of Nigerian youths to prevent the current situation in the country from getting out of control. ADC, in a statement at the weekend by its National Chairman, Chief Ralphs Nwosu, said that the lingering End SARS protests had exposed the intensity of the anger in the land. According to Nwosu, the country’s political class had failed to harness the enormous resources of Nigeria for sustainable growth and development over the years. The statement read in part: “The youths are agitating for a fresh paradigm. They’re smart kids, and Nigerians shouldn’t underestimate them. “When people have been robbed for far too long, of the same resources they took part in creating, this is usually the end result. “This is no longer about End SARS or End SWAT. It’s about End Impunity, End Terrorism, End Looting, End Vote Buying, End Leadership Insensitivity. “Police brutality, especially by the now defunct Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad, was at a scary level until this strong movement against it. “We declare our solidarity with the youths and call on the Federal Government to immediately set machinery in motion to ensure that their demands are genuinely met. “The youths have started what their parents have shied away from.”

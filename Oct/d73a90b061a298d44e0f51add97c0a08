Former Chelsea assistant coach, Gianfranco Zola, has predicted that Frank Lampard’s side will challenge Liverpool and Manchester City for the Premier League title this season after signing over five new players this summer. He also revealed he feels ‘sorry’ for Chelsea goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, adding that the Spain international is a good player. Chelsea are currently in the seventh position on the Premier League table, having won two of their opening four matches this season. “They (Chelsea) have spent a lot of money, and I believe they have spent it well,” Zola told Sky Sports. “They have brought in quality players, young players, so they have a big future in front of them. “Now, it will be blending them into the team that was already there and making a winning team because that is what is going to make a big difference. “Chelsea have a lot of young players in the squad, and you can see something big and important coming up, so I really hope this is going to happen. “Competition is very strong as you can imagine, it’s not going to be easy to get to the level of Liverpool or Manchester City. “Their platform is very high at the moment, but if they work well, they have the quality in the team to also reach those levels.” “Knowing Kepa, I am sorry for this situation,’ Zola added. ‘He’s a good boy and a good player. “When he arrived he came with a goalkeeper with a lot of potential but with a big burden with his massive price-tag. Now he seems like he’s not secure and he feels weak. “I feel sorry because this is not the real Kepa. He’s feeling the pressure and making mistakes, but the potential still remains. “I think he can become a top goalkeeper. I think he has shown that. It depends on what Frank wants to do. “Right now, you can see the player is not comfortable and feels insecure. That is not good. But it depends on what Frank and Kepa want to do.”

President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, has insisted his principal does not need to sign an Executive Order disbanding the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). In a tweet on Monday, Ahmad explained that SARS is “an administrative creation” of the Inspector-General of Police and was “not created by any executive order or legislative act”. According to him, the IGP Mohammed Adamu has “full authority” and has already disbanded the tactical unit. “The defunct SARS was a unit of the Police. It was an administrative creation of the IG of Police, not created by any executive order or legislative act. “We actually don’t need an executive order to fully disband the unit when the IGP with full authority has already disbanded it,” Ahmad wrote. Adamu announced the dissolution of SARS on Sunday.

The Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN, also known as Shiites, says it has found it necessary to dispel the rumours currently making the rounds that the leader of the movement, Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky has passed away. In a statement to DAILY POST, signed by its Spokesman, Ibrahim Musa, the sect said, “We believe the originators of the rumours and its circulation are government-sponsored mischief-makers trying to plunge the nation into further chaos. “Sheikh Ibraheem Zakzaky was visited by his family members on Saturday, 24/10/2020 in the Kaduna Correctional Centre where he is being held on trumped-up charges by the Kaduna State government of Elrufa’i. “While the Sheikh indeed suffers from potentially life-threatening health challenges due to injuries to his vital organs and the subsequent prolonged incarceration without adequate care, none of the news is new. “Clearly, this rumour is emanating from the government and its agents, intent on dragging and soiling the name of the Islamic Movement into their self-inflicted chaotic situation in the country currently, thereby causing further mayhem and unrest as a diversionary tactic. “Since the federal government of General Buhari has continued to contemptuously defy a federal high court ruling that freed him since 2016, however, it will be held responsible should any untoward thing happen to the Sheikh under any guise.”

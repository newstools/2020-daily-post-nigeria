Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has admitted he was left frustrated by Arsenal goalkeeper, Bernd Leno, following their Carabao Cup exit on Thursday night. Leno was in sensational form against the Reds, making a number of fine saves as it ended 0-0 after 90 minutes. The Gunners went on to triumph 5-4 on penalties, with Leno saving two spot-kicks during the shoot-out. “I told him after the game I was not too happy about that! Both halves were good, but in the second half, we shot him warm for the penalty shootout. Really good moments,” Klopp said. “As a manager, I wish that we scored but I want to see that we create a lot of moments in the game and it’s then about individual quality. We have the quality and we showed the quality, but it just didn’t work out tonight and that’s completely ok. We will try again, I can promise.”

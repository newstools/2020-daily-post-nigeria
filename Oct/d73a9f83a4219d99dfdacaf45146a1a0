The Senator representing Benue South Senatorial District, Comrade Abba Moro, has called for urgent need to investigate and review excessive charges by Nigerian banks on customers’ accounts. The senator made this call in a motion he moved on the floor of the senate during Wednesday’s plenary. The motion was massively supported by other senators, who agreed that something was truly wrong with the charges on customers’ accounts by banks. After various contributions by colleagues in support of the motion, the Senate resolved to: “Direct the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and other Financial Institutions to cause an investigation into this complaint of Nigerians of illicit and excessive bank charges by Commercial Banks on customers’ accounts; and “Direct the Central Bank of Nigeria to look into the complaints of Nigerians in this regard and review downwards the charges of their Bank accounts.”

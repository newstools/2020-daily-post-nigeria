Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has been criticised by former Manchester United striker, Andy Cole, for picking Willian to start up top over Alexandre Lacazette in their 1-0 defeat to Manchester City. Raheem Sterling’s first half strike handed City all three points on Saturday. Lacazette did come on for Willian until the 69th minute and ultimately failed to make an impact. Arteta’s decision to bench Lacazette has been labelled “disrespectful” by Cole. “I think he is being disrespectful to Lacazette as well. Willian is not a centre-forward,” Cole said on talkSPORT. “If you have got a centre-forward on the bench who is your top goalscorer as well, to turn around and say, ‘Look, I am going to play Willian as the centre-forward. You sit on the bench and watch him play centre-forward’, I think that is very disrespectful.”

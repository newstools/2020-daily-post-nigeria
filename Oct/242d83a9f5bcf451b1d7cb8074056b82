Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, has asked Ndigbo resident in Lagos State to defend themselves in case of any attack on them. The youth wing of the apex Igbo socio-cultural organisation said it has uncovered plots by unnamed persons to attack Igbos in Lagos on 26th October. OYC noted that there are video flying about where some foreign-based Yoruba persons have threatened to attack Igbos residing in the Southwest, especially Lagos. OYC said that the verbal attacks and threats are plots by desperate individuals to create confusion and grounds for the purported planned declaration of State of emergency in Lagos. OYC said it has uncovered a glandestine plot by displaced Southwest leaders that were sacked by #EndSARS protesters to resort to threats and violence on Igbo lives and properties in the Southwest “This intended attack on Igbos is hatched by disgruntled Yoruba Elders in Ekiti and Osun States, using the misguided utterances and bogus claims of a Biafra leader as an excuse to unleash hooliganism and terror attacks on Igbos by midnight 26th October 2020,” Ohanaeze said in a statement signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, its
President General, and made available to DAILY POST on Saturday. “We are confident that Afenifere and Yoruba Council of Elders will refute this video and douse the tensions and panic associated with the planned attack on Igbos. “Rise up and defend yourself great Igbos. We will never be dragged into the waves of violence in Southwestern Nigeria. Igbos deserve respect from Yorubas not terror attacks,” he said.

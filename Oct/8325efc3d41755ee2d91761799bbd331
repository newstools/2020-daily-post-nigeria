President Muhammadu Buhari addressed the nation Thursday night. He spoke on the End SARS protests, violence and government actions. But Nigerians are not impressed. The social media is awash with condemnatory comments. After the announcement of his broadcast, citizens had high expectations. They looked forward to announcement of probe of security operatives who use lethal force against peaceful demonstrators. “I am indeed deeply pained that innocent lives have been lost. These tragedies are uncalled for and unnecessary”, Buhari noted. But many say they expected a stronger position on deaths and injuries. The president, however, paid tribute to officers of the Nigeria Police Force who tragically lost their lives in the line of duty. The Nigerian added that protesters’ demands are being implemented. Buhari said authorities shall continue to ensure that liberty and freedom, as well as the fundamental rights of all citizens, are protected. He said the government respects and will continue to respect all the democratic rights and civil liberties of the people. Buhari warned that “anybody or groups” will not be allowed to disrupt the peace of the nation. Renowned activist, Aisha Yesufu expressed her disappointment on Twitter. “Not a word from Buhari @MBuhari about #EndSars protesters killed. Not a word about citizens killed in Zamfara. You still have doubt that this man cares for no one and everyone is feeling the effect of his incompetence?”, she said. “He didn’t even acknowledge them. Wow”, Music start, Simi wrote in reference to the deceased. “Buhari didn’t have a word for the victims of the recent killings in Zamfara and across the north. That tells you how much he values those peddling disinformation to defend the indefensible” Bulama Bukarti tweeted. “No empathy. No hope. No apology. No accountability”, Dipo Awojide wrote.

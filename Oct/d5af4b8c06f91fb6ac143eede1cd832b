The End SARS protest in Awka, which began at 8am on Wednesday, is dragging into the night as protesters have blocked the Anambra Government House and the Enugu-Onitsha expressway, insisting on being addressed by the state governor, Chief Willie Obiano. As at the time of filing this report, the protesters are still on the express, and have called in a Disk Jockey (DJ), while holding a party in the middle of the road with hundreds of young people dancing and having fun. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-848625" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173151_827-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173151_827-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173151_827-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173151_827-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173151_827-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173151_827-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"> One of the organizers, who did not mention his name, while addressing protesters said, “Even if Obiano is in the US, we demand that he must fly back and address us by himself, else, we will not leave.” As at 7pm, the protesters have stayed for seven hours on the road, leaving a long line of vehicles on the road. DAILY POST reports that security operatives, including men of the DSS and Nigeria Police Force who are attached to the Anambra State Government House stood helplessly by the gate of the government house as the protesters sang and danced, denying vehicles entry into the government house or out, just as no vehicle was allowed to drive past the expressway. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-848624" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173200_887-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173200_887-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173200_887-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173200_887-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173200_887-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201014_173200_887-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"> An onlooker who identified himself as Mr Obinna told DAILY POST that, “Some DSS men came here and tried to stop them earlier, but they resisted them. They took their phones, smashed them and also smashed the rear glass of their Sienna vehicle, then contributed money and gave to them to replace it. “Their leader told the DSS men that they were here on a peaceful protest, and if the DSS men stayed away from interrupting the protest, they would be safe. The DSS men are over there,” he said. It was, however, gathered that the governor was not in town. Phone calls to James Eze, the Chief Press Secretary to the governor to know if there was a plan by any government official to address the protesters were not answered.

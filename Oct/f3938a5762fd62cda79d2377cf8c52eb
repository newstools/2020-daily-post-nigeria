The Premier League has released a strongly-worded statement over claims that Manchester United and Liverpool are leading proposals to radically change English football. The two clubs are understood to have been working for three years, on a radical set of proposals to reshape both the Premier League and EFL. Entitled ’Project Big Picture’, it is being seen in some quarters as a power grab by the Big Six who will become more powerful within the Premier League. That is because it would involve the scrapping of the one-club, one-vote rule which has underpinned the Premier League since its inception in 1992. However, the Premier League have said they are disappointed with EFL chief, Rick Parry, for his “on the record support” and insisting that they see a number of the proposals as being “damaging”. “In the Premier League’s view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan published today could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, Chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support. “The Premier League has been working in good faith with its clubs and the EFL to seek a resolution to the requirement for COVID-19 rescue funding. This work will continue,” the statement read in part.

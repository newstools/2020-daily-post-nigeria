Former Chelsea star, Pat Nevin, has urged manager, Frank Lampard, to recall Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Mateo Kovacic for the Blues’ Champions League clash against Krasnodar. Chelsea will on Wednesday night face Krasnodar in Russia in their second Champions League tie for this season, having drawn 0-0 with Sevilla last week. Lampard’s men head to the game following a goalless draw against Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday. Abraham, Mount and Kovacic all started on the bench for Chelsea against Man United, but Nevin reckons the trio could return to the club’s starting XI against Krasnodar. “The starting XI for this one will take a great deal of thought from Frank,” Nevin was quoted by Chelsea’s official website. “Having drawn with Sevilla, three points would be very handy here, but he has to be careful not to push players too far this early in the season. “I am sure he will want as many youthful, energetic and tireless legs on the field as possible, so I will not be surprised if the young guns such as Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount are used from the start. “Then, of course, there are the likes of Mateo Kovacic, who could really do with another 90 minutes pretty soon. He should also have plenty of energy to spare.”

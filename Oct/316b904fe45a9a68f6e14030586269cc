Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has debunked claims that he instructed his followers to destroy properties belonging to the people of Yoruba on Wednesday. The IPOB leader said that enemies twisted his statement to suit their purposes. Nnamdi Kanu, therefore, called on the entire Igbo to guard against any destruction in the ongoing End SARS protests across the nation. Kanu stated this during an emergency IPOB Zoom meeting titled: “#EndSARS is not an ethnic protest, stop the propaganda to make it one.” According to Kanu, agents of the Nigerian Government adulterated parts of his recent broadcast to create the impression that he had turned the End SARS crisis against people of the South West The Zoom meeting was also attended by Femi Fani-Kayode, some notable Yoruba elites, as well as members of Igbo, think thank group, Nzuko Umunna. Kanu said that “Those who caused division between Chief Obafemi Awolowo and Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe during their time are bent on pitching Ndigbo and Yoruba against themselves in the present time.” He called on the people to ignore any divisive statements credited to him.

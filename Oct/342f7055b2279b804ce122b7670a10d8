Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has insisted his time at Barcelona is “over”. Guardiola stated this on Saturday, after a 1-0 win at Sheffield United in the Premier League. The Spaniard was responding to speculations linking him with a return to the Nou Camp, where he coached the first team from 2008 to 2012. One of the candidates to replace Josep Bartomeu as Barcelona president, Victor Font, revealed his hopes of bringing Guardiola back to the club if he is successful in the upcoming presidential election. “I said many times: my period as a manager in Barcelona is over,” Guardiola told BT Sport. “I think in life there is once, in a lifetime you have to do the things. There are incredible people who can be in charge. “Now, for example, Ronald Koeman is an excellent manager. It’s over. “I will come back to my seats to see my club to watch the game. But it’s done. “I am here, incredibly happy, and still have the desire to do well. This is the most important thing. “Now there will be elections in Barcelona, hopefully, they can choose the right person to the right board, to maintain this incredible club at the highest level.”

Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma has imposed a total curfew on the State. This is following the ongoing protests by the youths, demanding an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), for an alleged brutality on innocent citizens. Uzodinma gave the order via a broadcast on Tuesday, October 20, 2020. The reason for the curfew, according to him, was to arrest the situation in order to avoid loss of lives and properties. DAILYPOST reports that the curfew took effect from 12 midnight and only allows movement of those on essential duties. He said, “let me commend the youths of Imo state for their peaceful conduct so far even as they joined their counterparts all over the country to condemn police brutality and seek far reaching reforms that will lead to a more responsive and responsible policing in our country. “I’m however happy that President Muhammadu Buhari has already taken steps to implement the demands of the youths. Apart from disbanding SARS, the federal government has released 38 billion Naira to the police trust fund to kick start a holistic reform of the force. “Only yesterday, I set up a judicial commission of inquiry to investigate the alleged human rights abuses by the disbanded SARS. “All these actions point to the indisputable fact that the expectations of the protesters are being genuinely addressed by both the federal and state governments. “But I regret that some unpatriotic elements in the state have infiltrated the genuine protest by the youths, escalating tension and unleashing violence in the state. This will no longer be condoned by the government. “The 24 hour curfew has begun in the state. This means there will not be any free movement in the state except those on essential duties. This is to avoid any probable loss of lives and properties.” The Governor further advised Imo people to heed to the instruction for the short period it will last.

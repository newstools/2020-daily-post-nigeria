Following the development, Tiwa who is also one of the Protesters in a video shared via her Instagram account on Thursday urged Nigerian youths to join the protest and let the government know that they are tired of bad governance. She also advised youths to stop relying on celebrities adding that the country’s problem is for all and should be solved by all. According to her, “If Nigerian youths don’t come out to protest they will think that we are jokers and that’s why they don’t take us seriously.” “Please nobody should put on any stupid comments on my timeline. “This is not a day for stupid comments, everyone is out here protesting. “We are protesting for our own benefits. This is serious and it is no time to joke around. “Nigerian youths you guys need to wake up. There are people out there that have lost children. “This is not a time to joke because there’s nothing funny about this. “They think Nigerian youths are lazy and that’s why they don’t take us seriously. “None of us wants to die as a joke. You don’t have to rely on celebrities because you don’t call on them when you are voting for Big Brother Housemates. “Everyone should better come next week Tuesday and join in this protest,” she said.

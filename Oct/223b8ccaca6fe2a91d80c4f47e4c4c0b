Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, has said that Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, helped him to become a better player today. Osimhen explained that he grew up watching Drogba play, adding that the former Ivorian striker was an example for him. The 21-year-old Nigerian international said he fell in love with Drogba’s way of playing and that has had a major impact on his game. “I grew up watching Didier Drogba play, he was an example for me,” Osimhen told Napoli’s YouTube channel. “One day I was training, and a man called me asking if I knew who I play like. He told me to go to YouTube and see Didier Drogba. “There, I fell in love with his way of playing and the kind of person he is. “From that moment, seeing Drogba play had a major impact on my game and helped me a lot.” Osimhen joined Napoli from Lille in a big-money move last summer transfer window, and the forward is expected to play some major part in the club’s ambitions this season.

An FCT High Court sitting in Nyanya on Thursday remanded a barber, Mohammed Sani, for allegedly defiling a six-year-old boy. The Prosecuting Counsel, Mr Kufreabasi Ebong, informed the court that the defendant committed the offence on April 1, 2020. He said the defendant at about 5 p.m. on April 1, 2020, at Rufan Fulani sexually abused a six-year-old boy. According to him, the offence contravenes Section 284 of the Penal Code. However, Justice Peter Kekemeke in his ruling ordered the remand of the defendant after he informed the court that he had no lawyer. He adjourned the matter until Dec. 8 for hearing, NAN reports.

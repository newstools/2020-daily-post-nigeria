Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has told Sergio Aguero that he must show he “deserves to continue here” before earning a new contract. Aguero’s current deal is set to expire at the end of this season. The 32-year-old who is City’s all-time leading scorer, played for just over an hour in their 1-0 home win over Arsenal in the Premier League on Saturday, as he returned from a four-month injury layoff. Guardiola is convinced Aguero will be able to rediscover his prolific goalscoring form, but has warned the Argentina international his future at the club is not guaranteed. “Sergio now has to show, like every one of us, that he deserves to continue here – keep playing well, scoring goals and winning games – and after that the club and I will decide. “But if he is playing in his level we don’t have any doubts that he is a player to stay until he decides because he is unique. He is important for us, our fans and everyone,” Guardiola said according to Sky Sports.

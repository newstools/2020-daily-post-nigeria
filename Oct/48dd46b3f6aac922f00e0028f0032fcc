The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has raised alarm about what it called ongoing massacre in Nigeria. Imo Ugochinyere, the spokesman, in a statement on Wednesday, expressed sadness at the turn of End SARS protests. CUPP decried that the peaceful demonstrations by courageous Nigerian youths asking for a better deal from their government had become bloody and fatal. The body said it was taken aback that a democratic government in the 20th century can turn the face of guns to harmless protesters. “The mass killings of Nigerian youths in Lekki and other parts of Lagos State as well as in Abuja, which started with deployment of armed bandits and lastly government security forces are serious crimes against humanity,” it said. CUPP demanded that recorded events must be probed and murderous elements identified and prosecuted. “We are therefore calling on the International Criminal Court and other global bodies not only to take note of the massacre going on in Nigeria but to also ensure that all those behind this are brought to book. “Nigerians will never forget that on the night of Tuesday, October 20, 2020, a government that they are sustaining with their taxes unleashed mayhem on them and killed the youths in their numbers”, the statement added.

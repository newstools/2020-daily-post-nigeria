Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, and chieftain of the New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, has said he will not fold his hands and watch the present administration send Nigerians to their early graves. Bamgbose said this in reaction to viral videos and photos where he could be seen selling fuel to motorists in different feeling stations at a subsidized rate of N100. Speaking with DAILY POST, the senior lawyer, who has also declared interest to run in the next presidential election, noted that the fuel price hike is no doubt biting hard on Nigerians coupled with the effect of COVID-19. He said that he had gone around the country to see for himself how many Nigerians are suffering and berated labour unions for disappointing the masses when they backed out of the nationwide strike. “We won’t allow Buhari to kill Nigerians. We can no longer hinge our hope in Buhari or else things will get worse. It’s time for Nigerians to take the bull by the horn and help themselves out,” he said Bamgbose promised that his fuel subsidy will run in the six geo political zones of Nigeria, as the people of Abia state were the first to partake. “It’s time to alleviate the sufferings and hardship experienced by the poor masses,” Bamgbose said. He had earlier told journalists who witnessed him dispensing fuel at a subsidized rate of N100 as against the official government price of N161 per litre, that he feels pained to see the hardship experienced by Nigerians as result of the removal of fuel subsidy. “Life has been unbearable for most Nigerians, that is why he took it upon himself to give succour to the people who have been left to their own fate by the present administration.” Bamgbose said that if Nigerians consider and put him in power come 2023, fuel will be sold at N100 per litre from June 2023.

Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has condemned the killings that occurred in Ogbomoso during last weekend’s End SARS protest embarked upon by some youths in the state. In a statewide broadcast on Monday in Ibadan, Makinde expressed sadness over the unwarranted killing of innocent citizens of the state. “My dear good people of Oyo State, the past few days have been ones of grief for the people of Oyo State. “I cannot imagine the pain and frustration of the parents and families of those who have died or are hospitalised as a result of the actions of the Nigeria Police Force during these EndSARS protests. “As I stated clearly in my earlier statement, peaceful protests are a legitimate way for citizens to make their grievances known to the government and it is totally unacceptable for anyone to be hurt during such protests. “Last night, I held an emergency meeting with the heads of the main security agencies in Oyo State. I have again restated my position on the ongoing protests to them,” Makinde said. The governor said that “we have agreed that the police should take a back seat as other security agencies take the frontlines in securing the lives of protesters, at this time.” “Therefore, we have deployed members of Operation Burst to the hot spots, especially Ogbomoso, to ensure that as people protest, they will not be harassed or brutalised. “I want to reassure the good people of Oyo State that I am doing everything within my power to ensure that no further lives are lost. “I urge all residents of Oyo State to go about their activities without fear,” the governor stated. Makinde further urged the protesters “to please continue to protest peacefully. “These are trying times for all of us, and I pray that God continues to guide us and give us the wisdom to navigate through them,” Makinde said.

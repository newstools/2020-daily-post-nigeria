Several Manchester United players are said to be upset with manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, over his treatment of goalkeeper Sergio Romero, ESPN reports. The club failed to sanction Romero’s exit this summer, and he now faces the prospect of not playing any football until January at the earliest. The 33-year-old has been David De Gea’s deputy for the past five years, playing only seven Premier League matches in that time and making 61 appearances in all competitions. Romero has been mostly used in the FA Cup, Europa League and Carabao Cup. However, Dean Henderson’s return to Old Trafford from his loan spell at Sheffield United, has seen Romero drop down the pecking order. Romero was keen to leave as a result, but United insisted on a £10million fee for the goalkeeper, a price tag that scared off suitors including Everton. United players were left surprised by Solskjaer’s decision to play De Gea in both the FA Cup and Europa League semi-finals last season, despite the fact that Romero had been keeping goal for the majority of the competition. Romero has one year left on his contract, although United could trigger an option to extend.

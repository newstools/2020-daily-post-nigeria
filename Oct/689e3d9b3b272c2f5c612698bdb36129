A Customary Court in Mapo, Ibadan, on Friday, dissolved an eighteen-month-old marriage between an artisan, Musibau Alimi and his wife, Bolaji, because she beats him and has threatened to cause him harm. Delivering judgment, Chief Ademola Odunade, the President of the court, said the marriage was dissolved for the couple not to resort to” self-help”. Consequently, NAN reports that Odunade dissolved the union and granted custody of the only child to Bolaji. He ordered Alimi to pay N5,000 to Bolaji as the child’s monthly upkeep. Earlier, Alimi, who is a tiller, told the court to dissolve the union because Bolaji beats him. Alimi said, “Bolaji starts trouble by nagging for no particular reason and also spends most times in her mother’s company. “She returns home in the night to beat me. In fact, I packed out of my own house when Bolaji’s threat to my life became too much to bear.” On her part, Bolaji, who didn’t deny her husband’s allegations, told the court that her husband was an irresponsible man because he had never cared about her welfare. “Musibau has never been a caring partner because he comes home anytime he feels and sometimes abandons home for three days. “My mother paid for all my antenatal requirements when I was pregnant. “I only pray the court to compel my husband to be responsible for our child’s welfare,” Bolaji said. —

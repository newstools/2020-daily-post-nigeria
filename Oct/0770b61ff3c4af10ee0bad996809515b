Ghana president, Nana Akufo-Addo, has revealed that he has spoken with his Nigerian counterpart, President Muhammadu Buhari, about the ongoing End SARS protests. There have been violent scenes around Lagos state, a day after men suspected to be officers of the Nigerian Army shot at unarmed protesters at the Lekki Toll Gate. It has resulted in the burning and looting of several places within the metropolis. However, Akufo-Addo, in a terse statement on his verified Twitter account, said Buhari has assured him that the processes that will lead to reforms have begun. “I join all well-meaning persons in calling for calm, and the use of dialogue in resolving the End SARS impasse in Nigeria. I have spoken with President Buhari, who is committed to this end, and has begun the processes that will lead to reform. “Violence, be it on the part of the Police or protesters, cannot be the solution. To the families who have lost their loved ones, I express my sincere condolences, and I wish the injured a speedy recovery,” Akufo-Addo wrote.

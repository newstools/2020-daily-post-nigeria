No fewer than ten political parties have agreed to work for a consensus candidate during the governorship election in Ondo State on October 10. The political parties are working together under the Conference of INEC Registered Political Parties (CIRPP). The CIRPP disclosed this in Lagos State on Thursday in a statement jointly issued by Mr Olugbemi Ogunbameru (SDP), its Chairman, Comrade Israel Ayeni (AAC), Secretary and some other members of the coalition. It said: “The CIRPP Will, however, make its position known as to who to support and work for within 72 hours. “The CIRPP, hereby, informs the general public that the committee has not adopted any candidate for the slated election as insinuated by the public and envisaged by a group of persons who aren’t members of registered political parties. “There are earlier insinuations that the CIRPP is working and supporting a particular party, but there is nothing of such.” It added: “It’s our priority to ensure that the people of Ondo State will be guided to vote for the right person. “It’s our joy that a compassionate person wins in the forthcoming election.” The statement was co-issued by Prince Niran Toyin (APGA), Mr Olaoluwa Adesanya (APP), Chief Tokunbo Adetoro (ADC) and Dr Ajibola Falaiye (Accord). NAN reports that others in the coalition are Mr Olagookun Peter (NNPP), Mr Felix Funso Oloro (APM), Mrs Funmilayo Ataunoko (NRM) and Mr Amos Agunloye (LP).

Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku, on Saturday imposed a curfew on Jalingo, the state capital. The Deputy Governor of the State, Alhaji Haruna Manu, who announced the order in a statewide broadcast in Jalingo on Saturday night said the decision was due to the invasion of government warehouses by hoodlums on Saturday. He said the curfew was from 11 p.m. on Saturday to 8 a.m. on Monday. Manu also expressed worries that the hoodlums carted away palliatives meant for distribution to members of the public. “Some hoodlums and vandals forced their way into government warehouses and looted items meant for distribution as palliatives. “After this period, the government may decide to review the situation; our intention is to forestall further breakdown of law and order,” NAN quoted him as saying.

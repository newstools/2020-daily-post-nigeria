A former Liverpool defender, Jamie Carragher, has named Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur as the club he would like to win the Premier League title if the Reds are unable to defend their title this season. Mourinho has won three Premier League titles from his two spells at Chelsea and is now plotting the way to a fourth at Tottenham. Mourinho’s men moved up to the fifth position on the Premier League table on Monday night following a 1-0 victory over Burnley. “I want Liverpool to win the league, obviously but I would love to see Mourinho win again,” Carragher told Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “Because even though we talk here about tactics and systems and different things and we love it, we get ingrained in it. “Mourinho’s had so much thrown at him. He is yesterday’s man. His football’s from a different era. All these different things – fresh managers, whatever. “I would love to see Mourinho win again in terms of sticking two fingers up to him and me or different people or the press, the papers, whoever is out there. “I would love to see Mourinho win – if Jurgen didn’t.”

Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has warned Algeria that Nigeria will go all out to end their 18-match unbeaten streak in Friday’s international friendly match. Nigeria and Algeria will clash against each other on Friday night at the Worthersee Stadium in Klagenfurt in Austria. Algeria’s last defeat came almost two years ago, a 1-0 loss to Benin in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, qualifier. Djamel Belmadi’s side has won 13 and drawn 5 games. The reigning AFCON champions recorded victories against top sides like Senegal, Nigeria, Tunisia, Mali and Colombia. But Rohr is, however, confident that the Super Eagles can end Algeria’s impressive run of good results. “It is a match to test new players, we want to see what they are capable of, Algeria will be a big test for us, it is a team that has been undefeated for 18 games, and we will try to stop,” Rohr told a news conference on Thursday. “It is a great team in Africa, and they are champions of the African continent, we will try to put an end to their good results.”

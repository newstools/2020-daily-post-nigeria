New Manchester United player, Facundo Pellistri, has promised to work hard every day to earn regular playing time at the club and to prove himself in England. Pellistri stated this shortly after completing a move to Man United from Club Atletico Penarol on Monday night (transfer deadline day). The 18-year-old signed a five-year contract, with an option to extend for a further year. Pellistri told Man United’s official website: “To join a club with the history of Manchester United is a dream come true. I’ve learnt a lot at Penarol, and I would like to thank them for everything they have done for me. “To have the confidence of the manager is an amazing feeling, and I know that working with him will be perfect for my development. “I am coming into a squad full of great players who I will learn from every day. Everyone knows that Manchester United is a club that gives young players an opportunity, and I’m ready to work hard every day to earn those chances and prove myself in England.”

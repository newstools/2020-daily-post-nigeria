Michael Owen, a former Liverpool and Real Madrid striker, has predicted Newcastle vs Man United, Man City vs Arsenal and Chelsea vs Southampton Premier League fixtures. Owen backed Newcastle United to play a draw against Man United at St James’ Park on Saturday night. According to him, Man City will defeat Arsenal at Etihad on Saturday evening, while Chelsea will also beat Southampton at Stamford Bridge. “Newcastle will be more than happy with their start to their campaign,” Owen told BetVictor. “A 3-1 victory at home against Burnley was a solid enough performance, and I think the Magpies will quietly fancy their chances here. United come into this in disarray. “The result against Tottenham won’t be forgotten quickly, and I think it may take a few weeks yet for United to find their feet. I am going for a draw.” Speaking on the Man City vs Arsenal game, Owen said: “Arsenal make the visit to Manchester with their tails up. It’s been a pretty solid start from the Gunners, and they’ll go here with high hopes of taking something. “City simply needs to pick up, and back on home soil I can see Pep rallying his troops to claim the points.” Commenting on the Chelsea vs Southampton match, Owen said, “Chelsea are starting to click. “Their 4-0 win against Crystal Palace two weeks ago was their best performance of the season so far, and I fear a bit for goal-shy Southampton here. “I expect the Blues to have too much firepower, and despite lingering concerns regarding their back-line, I fancy them to take the points.” The kick-off time for Chelsea vs Southampton is 3 pm, while that of Man City vs Arsenal and Newcastle vs Man Utd is 5:30 pm and 8 pm respectively.

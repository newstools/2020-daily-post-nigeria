No fewer than fifty-three villagers including the village head and chief Imam of Lingayado community, Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State have reportedly been kidnapped by gunmen. An eyewitness, Abdulahi Mohammed, an indigene, who said he escaped the attack explained that the village head, Alhaji Dalhatu Mohammed and 53 others were whisked away by the abductors. He said the kidnappers stormed the village on motorbikes and began shooting sporadically and later went on a house to house search, kidnapping a total of fifty-three persons. “Though the bandits did not kill anybody neither did they rustle any domestic animal in the community but took the village head, chief Imam and 51 others,” he said. The eyewitness said he jumped over an open well and ran into the bush when the heavily armed bandits approached his house. Abdulahi Mohammed further said the village has since been deserted by residents who fear the armed bandits may resurface. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Mohammed Shehu confirmed the incident but said it was not yet certain how many people were kidnapped. Shehu said a team of armed police officers have been deployed to the axis to comb the areas and bring the culprits to justice as well as rescuing the kidnapped victims.

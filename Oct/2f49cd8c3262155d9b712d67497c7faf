Agoola Ajayi, the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, has said that the Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu gets a security vote of N750million naira and an imprest of about N150 million monthly. Ajayi, who is the governorship candidate of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) also claimed he (Ajayi) earns N12 million naira and not the N13 million as claimed by Governor Akeredolu. He was reacting to an earlier comment by Akeredolu claiming he (Ajayi) gets the highest running grant of N13m monthly. But the Deputy Governor in a statement signed by his media aide, Allen Sowore, expressed surprise that Akeredolu could announce to the world the sum of N13m as what Ajayi gets as if it was a gift. He said what he receives until the Governor stopped releasing same was 12million naira per month. According to him, this includes the imprest of Deputy Governor’s office, allowances of staff, fuelling of vehicles, care of his residence and welfare of his aides. “Huge as the amount may appear, it amounts to not so much when the heads and number of individuals it caters for are considered,” he added. “The governor gets a security vote of N750million naira every month. He, Akeredolu, also gets an imprest of about N150 million” The Deputy Governor further alleged that Akeredolu’s wife and son also collect millions of naira as imprest on monthly basis without occupying any constitutionally recognised positions.

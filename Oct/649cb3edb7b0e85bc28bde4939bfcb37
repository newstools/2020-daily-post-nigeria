The father of Jimoh Isiaka, the End SARS protester killed by the police, says he has accepted his fate. He wept uncontrollably on Saturday as mourners commiserated with him. Pa Jimoh spoke in Yoruba as he lamented the death of his son. “I have accepted my fate, I had no one except him,” he said. Isiaka was killed as protesters marched round Ogbomoso in Oyo State. Rubber bullets, chemical irritants and flash-bang grenades are standard crowd-control weapons. But the police in Nigeria routinely resort to live bullets to control situations at protest locations. This is Jimoh Isiaq’s Father weeping uncontrollably, imagine the pain he is going through, Please end Sars before they end us. @aproko_doctor @officialnairam1 @segalink @instablog9ja @chemicalbrodar #EndSarsNow #OgbomosoProtests #JimohIsiaq pic.twitter.com/lUK6LVd6PW — iFarmer (@billilee_) October 10, 2020

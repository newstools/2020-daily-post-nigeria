Inter Milan striker, Romelu Lukaku, has won the 2019/20 Europa League Best Player of the Season. Lukaku won the award on Friday in Nyon, Switzerland. The 27-year-old saw off competitions from Manchester United’s Bruno Fernandes, and Sevilla’s Ever Banega to win the fourth edition of the award. The Belgium international scored in all six of Inter Milan’s games after entering the competition in the knockout stage. The former Manchester United and Chelsea striker netted seven goals in total and also provided two assists. The forward opened the scoring from the penalty spot in August’s final, but he was unfortunate to later deflect in a shot that gave Sevilla the title. Lukaku ended 2019/20 with 34 goals in all competitions for Inter Milan.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, asked his players to target Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford, during their 6-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday, the Manchester Evening News reports. Mourinho is said to have instructed his full-backs Serge Aurier and Sergio Reguilon, to press high. The former United boss was confident that neither Rashford nor Greenwood would track back with them. With defending not the strong suit of either player, the Spurs’ full-backs were then able to push onto both Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who didn’t get any protection from the players in front of them. Aurier and Reguilon could then combine with Spurs’ wide forwards Erik Lamela and Heung-Min Son to inflict damage on the United backline. United took the lead through Bruno Fernandes, before Tottenham fought back through braces from Harry Kane and Son as well as strikes from Tanguy Ndombele and Aurier.

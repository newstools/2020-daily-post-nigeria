The National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS) on Monday appealed to the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai to Re-open both private and public schools in the state. In a press statement signed by the General Secretary and Chairman of the association on Monday, Mallam Ja’afaru Yusuf and Mr. Iorhena Philip Terfa said the government should specify a date for resumption. According to the statement, “We are concerned about the adverse effects the continuous lockdown of schools will have on the learners and the society, “We want to inform the general public and the Government that our schools are fully ready for resumption as we used the WAEC Exam as a litmus test and it ended without recording an infection or case. “We wish to congratulate the Governor and the entire NAPPS members on the occasion of our NAPPS day 12th October 2020 also our parents for the untiring support particularly in the provision of E-learning during the lockdown,” the statement said “We also observed that most states that have re-opened have no better preparedness than Kaduna State. “Our Prayer, let a specific date be announced to make our preparation more effective, this will also heal both students and schools physically and psychologically.” The statement added.

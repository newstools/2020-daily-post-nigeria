Human Rights lawyer, Femi Falana, on Monday said his group has identified the barracks where the soldiers who shot End SARS protesters at Lekki toll gate came from. Some soldiers had shot and killed some unarmed End SARS protesters seated at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos State. Following the outcry that greeted the incident, the military had denied the involvement of soldiers in the shooting. However, Human rights lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, Falana insists that soldiers were present at the Lekki toll gate and shot at protesters that day. Speaking on Arise Television, Falana maintained that there was evidence of soldiers shooting at the tollgate gate. According to Falana: “We have already identified the barracks where the soldiers left for Lekki, we have already identified the barracks. “The President was likely to have been told, soldiers were ordered, so, I want to believe that was why it was not addressed and they said it was a rumour but I think the facts are emerging now, that indeed soldiers went to Lekki, indeed they fired at protesters and indeed some of the protesters at least two have been officially acknowledged to have died from gunshot wounds.”

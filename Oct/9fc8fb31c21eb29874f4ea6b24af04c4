New Manchester United player, Facundo Pellistri, has identified the club’s former player, Diego Forlan, as one of the people that convinced him to join the Red Devils. Pellistri explained that Forlan advised him a lot, adding that the Uruguay legend plays an important role in his career. The 18-year-old completed a move to Man United from Club Atletico Penarol on transfer deadline day earlier this month. The Uruguayan youngster signed a five-year contract at Old Trafford, with an option to extend for a further year. “Diego was very important in my career, he was my coach. He advised me a lot,” Pellistri was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying on Thursday ahead of their Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Saturday. “We all know how Diego was as a player, but he’s a very good person too.” He added: “It’s unbelievable and fantastic to hear such comments from the players they were, and are. Cavani is going to be a team-mate of mine. So I’m very glad and happy to hear those comments. “Cavani is a top player, and I think he’ll be a great player here also.”

A Nigerian man has been arrested in Malaysia for the murder of a 36-year-old fellow Nigerian over a love triangle involving a Malaysian woman. The Kuala Lumpur Police Chief Comm, Datuk Saiful Azly Kamaruddin, disclosed this during a press conference at the Sentul police headquarters on Monday. He said that the yet-to-be-named Nigerian man was found dead at a condominium unit in Jalan Kuching, Kuala Lumpur on September 23, with wounds on his neck, face and arms. “After two weeks, we managed to detain the main suspect in front of the Nigerian High Commission. The 34-year-old man was the victim’s housemate and was attempting to seek protection from the embassy. “We believe the motive behind the murder was a misunderstanding involving the Malaysian woman, and we believe that the suspect and victim were both attracted to the woman, ”he said.

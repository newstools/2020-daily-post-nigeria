Femi Fani-Kayode, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and a social commentator, has warned against any plan by President Muhammadu Buhari and the Chief of Army Staff, Tukur Buratai to crush End SARS protesters with military force. He said such a move will lead to the end of Nigeria. The protests for the scrapping of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, unit of the police have intensified despite government’s announcement of the disbandment of the operation. Currently, captions such as, “end bad government in Nigeria; end bad governance; end police brutality; Justice for Jimoh Isaiq; restructure Nigeria; reform the Nigeria Police”, among others are trending on social media and also appearing on placards on the streets to indicate that the protest has gradually shifted from its original purpose. The former Minister of Aviation warned that it would be disastrous to kill the protesting youth the same way members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN, were killed. In a tweet on Sunday morning, Fani-Kayode said, “The plan to deploy soldiers to slaughter #EndSARS protesters just as Shiite Muslims and IPOB youths were once butchered will be Burutai & Buhari’s gravest error. “It will turn the #Endsars movement into the #EndNigeria movement. We warn again: Do not kill these innocent youths.”

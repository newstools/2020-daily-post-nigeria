Flights in and out of the domestic airport could not be made following the discovery of a huge hole on the runway. Following the development, which was yet to be ascertained on how it happened; management of the airport prevented flights from the airport. According to a source in the airport, the hole was discovered during the routine checks on the runway as well as other airport facilities.

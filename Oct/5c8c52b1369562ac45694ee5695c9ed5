Music superstar, Ayo Balogun, also known as Wizkid, has mocked Lauretta Onochie. Onochie is President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Assistant on Social Media. On Friday, Wizkid tweeted at her, wondering why she’s not protesting like other mothers. “@Laurestar old woman…. “see your mates” God bless every woman #EndSARS”. The tweet was in reaction to a march against SARS by hundreds of women in Lagos. They asked that authorities proscribe SARS for their extra-judicial activities. “Stop killing our children, they are the leaders of tomorrow”, they chanted. Some days ago, Wizkid called President Buhari an old man. This was after the Nigerian leader wished United States President Donald Trump recovery after he tested positive for COVID-19. In her reply, Lauretta called Wizkid a dumb kid.

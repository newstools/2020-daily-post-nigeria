The Pan-Yoruba Socio-political organization, Afenifere, has denied involvement in a viral video which threatened the Igbo extraction from the South East of Nigeria to quit Yoruba land. According to Afenifere, there is no affiliation whatsoever with the initiator of the quit order which gave the Igbos 48 hours ultimatum to leave the South West region. Amid the tension in the country which was occasioned by series of violent protests, a UK based Nigerian with the name Adeyinka Grandson had in a viral video on social media issued a quit notice for some nationals especially the Igbo to vacate Yoruba Land, a situation which has continued to generate reactions across board. Afenifere, in a statement personally signed by its National leader, Pa Reuben Fasoranti in Akure, Ondo State capital disowned the alleged quit notice. The statement reads, “Our attention has been drawn to a Whatsapp video now going viral, purportedly issued by one Adeyinka Grandson or his representative, giving a 48-hour ultimatum ending on Sunday, October 25, 2020 for some Nigerian nationals, especially the Igbo, to quit Yorubaland. “Most embarrassing to me as Afenifere Leader was that the young man who made the announcement kicked off with the well-known tune of Afenifere anthem, thus giving the impression that it was an Afenifere initiative. “This is to say that we do not know anything about the quit order nor are we in any way connected with its issuance or the initiators. “For the time being, in addition to our other releases, let us all maintain peace.” Pa Fasoranti, however, urged people of the region and Nigeria at large to embrace peace.

Manchester United midfielder, Andreas Pereira, has left Old Trafford to join Serie A club, Lazio on a season-long loan ahead of the Red Devils’ Premier League clash with Tottenham Hotspur this weekend. Lazio confirmed this in a post via its official Twitter handle on Thursday evening. Pereira has fallen down the pecking order under manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad since the arrivals of Bruno Fernandes and Donny van de Beek. The 24-year-old was not included in Man United’s matchday squads for their first two Premier League matches this season. Pereira also missed Man United’s match against Luton in the Carabao Cup. Meanwhile, speaking about Pereira recently, Lazio manager, Simone Inzaghi said the Brazilian would be perfect for the club. Inzaghi said: “I like Pereira so much, He would be perfect for us.”

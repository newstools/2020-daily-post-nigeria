Unbelievable. Just always so absent. Also, Olamide took to his Twitter page wondering why the Nigerian government has refused to act despite call by Nigerians to End SARS. “Police brutality is skyrocketing by the day and the Nigeria gov. is not deaf nor blind, they see all the trends and tag along with which ever one they like. “ You don’t have to like this one to do right thing. The hashtags are becoming tiring. The people are sick of it,” Olamide tweeted.

Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, has predicted a ‘difficult’ clash when his team face Barcelona in today’s La Liga El Clasico tie at Camp Nou. Zidane explained that Barcelona is a team that is always strong with every coach they had so far. According to him, Barca will always be Barca, adding that the Catalan club knows how to play good football and can still make things difficult for their opponent. Real Madrid head to the game following a 3-2 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League earlier this week. “They’re a team that is always strong with every coach. Everyone brings their own things, but Barça is always Barça,” Zidane was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “They are a team that knows how to play good football and can always make things difficult for you. I won’t go into the details. “What I do know is that we are going to have a difficult game and that’s good for us. To get out on the field and play a game that is going to be difficult from the start.”

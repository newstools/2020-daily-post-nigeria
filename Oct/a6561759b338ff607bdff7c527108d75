Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has assured Odion Ighalo that he still remains part of his plans, despite the arrival of Edinson Cavani. Ighalo made a bright start at Old Trafford, scoring five in his first four starts. However, since football resumed after the lockdown, the former Super Eagles striker has yet to feature regularly. Cavani has not travelled for United’s Champions League group stage opener against former club Paris Saint-Germain. This could mean Ighalo who was back on the bench for the 4-1 win at Newcastle, will be named as a substitute tonight. Solskjaer said ahead of the game: “I think as a team and a club we always want to get players in. And I think Edinson coming in, we’ll give him time to adapt to the Premier League and get his sharpness and fitness back. “We’ve had some very good performances by Odion and he’s still a very important part of this squad.”

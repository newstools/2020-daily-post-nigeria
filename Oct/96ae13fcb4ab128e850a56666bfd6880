Manchester United have reached an agreement with AS Roma for the transfer of defender, Chris Smalling on a permanent basis. Man United disclosed this in a statement via its official website on Monday night. Smalling was signed by Sir Alex Ferguson in 2010 from Fulham. The England centre-back went on to make 323 appearances for Man United, scoring 18 goals. Meanwhile, Manchester United also confirmed the signing of centre-back, Willy Kambwala, from Ligue 2 club, Sochaux. Kambwala, 16, has represented Sochaux Under-19 level and has captained France’s Under-17. The defender will join Neil Ryan’s Under-18 squad once his mandatory period of self-isolation is complete.

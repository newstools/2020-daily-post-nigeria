The governor also said that he expects the panel to turn in its report within 12 weeks, describing the turn of events of the End SARS protest as unfortunate in view of the collateral damage so caused on lives and properties in the State and urged the youths to refrain from further protesting on the issue as government has noted their demands and doing everything possible to address them.

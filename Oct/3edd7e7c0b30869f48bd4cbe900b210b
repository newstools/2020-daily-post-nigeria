Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, has joined the End SARS campaign going on across Nigeria. He tweeted the hashtag at 9:40pm Nigerian time on Wednesday. The philanthropist also tweeted a link on #EndSARS and #EndPoliceBrutality. Jorsey’s display of solidarity comes 24 hours after music superstar, Kanye West, added his voice. Kanye told authorities to listen to citizens. “I stand with my Nigerian brothers and sisters to end police brutality, the government must answer to the peoples cries #EndPoliceBrutalityinNigeria”, the fashion mogul tweeted. Earlier, Black Lives Matter declared that it rises with demonstrators as they stand against the defunct notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad. More than 6 people have died and scores wounded since last Saturday. The federal government had been accused of attempting to suppress the Twitter campaign.

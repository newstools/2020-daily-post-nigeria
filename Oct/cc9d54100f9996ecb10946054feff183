Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has claimed he wants to extend his stay at the Premier League club, rather than return to Barcelona. Guardiola will be out of contract at the Etihad Stadium next summer. Barcelona’s presidential front-runner, Victor Font, has already declared his intention to bring the 49-year-old back to Camp Nou. The LaLiga club’s outgoing president, Josep Maria Bartomeu resigned this week ahead of an expected vote of no confidence next month. “I’m incredibly happy here. “I’m delighted to be happy here and hopefully I can do a good job here this season to stay longer,” Guardiola said. Guardiola was in charge of Barca between 2008 and 2012, a spell that saw him win 14 trophies.

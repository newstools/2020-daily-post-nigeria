An automobile mechanic, who was identified as Salaudeen Lawal, was on Sunday stabbed to death by a notorious cultist terrorising Igbesa in Ogun State. DAILY POST reports that the suspected cultist is currently at large. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST this afternoon. It was gathered that Lawal was invited by a car owner to help repair his vehicle which had developed a fault along the road in Igbesa, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government area of Ogun State. But in the course of his duty, the said cultist, identified as Bobo, was said to have accused him of blocking the road. According to Oyeyemi, an altercation ensued and “the said Bobo broke a bottle and stabbed the deceased on his hand and cut one of the veins.” “Distress call was made to the police at Igbesa divisional headquarters and the DPO SP Abayomi Adeniji quickly led his men to the scene and rescued the victim to the hospital where he gave up the ghost while receiving treatment,” it was said. The suspect, having realized what he did, fled the scene of the incident immediately, our correspondent learnt.

Meanwhile, the culprit has been declared wanted by the police as the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, launched a manhunt for him. Ajogun urged residents of the community to remain, assuring them that the suspect would be arrested.

An armed gang have abducted Clement Uhembe, a senior lecturer with the Federal University, Lafia in Nasarawa State. Uhembe is a former commissioner in the state. The gunmen invaded his residence in Lafia at about 8:30pm Tuesday, Daily Nigerian reports. His wife, Amarya Uhembe, said the abductors, about ten, broke into one of their apartments as the husband was observing siesta after returning from work. The lecturer has been taken to an unknown destination. “When I noticed they were armed men, I quickly tried to close the door, shouting for help before my husband came to join me in the struggle to close the door. They forced themselves into the parlour.” She said the gunmen later allowed her husband access to his mobile phone to communicate their demand. Amarya disclosed that they asked for a N30 million ransom.

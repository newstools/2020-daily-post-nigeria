Assistant Inspector General of Police (rtd), Dr. Charles Ugomuoh has called on the Federal government to fully implementation the five point demands of the End SARS protesters. Speaking in Abuja, the ex-Police boss, who is the Chairman, Board of Trustees of CUG Foundation, a non-governmental organisation, said the demand by the End SARS protesters calls for serious government attention. He said the disbandment of SARS by the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu was appropriate step, saying that the purpose for which SARS were created while he was in service had been grossly abused. Ugomuoh maintained that government must engage the protesting youths, and that the idea of not having leadership for government to talk to them was a mere pretense. “EndSARS is a metaphor, a call to end poverty, call for end to perversive unemployment and call for change from bad government, a call for electoral reforms. “How can the protesters say they have no leadership, but somebody is funding and feeding them. The EndSARS is ganering ethnic dimension,” he added. While faulting President Muhammadu Buhari’s appointees, he said government had been disconnected from the governed, adding that the resources being looted daily by the President’s appointees could have been used as unemployment allowances. According to him, government should be rejigged.

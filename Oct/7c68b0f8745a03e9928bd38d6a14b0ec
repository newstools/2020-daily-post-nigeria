Balarabe Musa, former governor of old Kaduna State, on Sunday, said Nigeria could have been better if the leaders had done well. Musa made the remark while noting that Nigeria has not done well in actualising most of the dreams of its founding fathers at 60. Speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, the elder statesman, however, stated that Nigeria’s aspirations could be achieved if both the leadership and followers resolved to play their part in earnest nation-building . “Honestly, the country has not fared well at 60. It is very disappointing that this is where we are. “But things can be better; we can still achieve the dreams of the founding fathers if we all play our role in nation-building,” he said. He urged leaders to always make the welfare and well-being of the people the focus of their policies and programmes. The former Governor stressed that political and economic restructuring of the country was key for progress “We need to restructure the country politically and economically. We need to ensure that power actually resides with the people. “The economic and political models we are currently operating only empower a few. Governments must be structured to impact posively on the masses,” he said. He decried the security challenges in the country, saying the problem was threatening the progress and prosperity of the nation. Musa said if the country had acted at the right time, the rising cases of banditry and the problem of insurgency could have been averted . “We acted too late. Things are getting out of hand because we did not act at the right time. If we had taken timely actions ,we would not been here,” he said. Musa, however, said that the situation could still be reversed “if we sustain doing the right thing,” he said.

The Street of Jibowu in Lagos State has been littered with corpses as security operatives engage youths in the area in the ongoing crisis in Lagos State. What has been a peaceful protest in the state turned bloody on Tuesday night after soldiers from the Nigerian Army opened fire at unarmed protesters, killing some and leaving others with various degrees of injuries. However, the violence escalated today, Wednesday 21, 2020 as the youths took to the streets destroying and setting properties ablaze. Several videos online have also shown armed men gunning down youths in the state. A video obtained by DAILY POST shows corpses littered on the ground at Jibowu as mourners gathered around. Video… God have mercy … do they want to finish the youths?

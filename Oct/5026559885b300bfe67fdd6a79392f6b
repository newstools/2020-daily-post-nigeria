Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has left Phil Jones and Sergio Romero from his 25-man squad for the Premier League. The pair were also left out of United’s Champions League squad last week. There are also two lists: the main one and one comprised of homegrown players. Academy products or players under the age of 21 are not included in the main group. This is why Brandon Williams, Mason Greenwood and Facundo Pellistri have not been listed, despite the fact they are all in United’s 25-man squad. Marcos Rojo is one of 13 names on the non-homegrown list, along with deadline day signings Alex Telles and Edinson Cavani. MAIN LIST

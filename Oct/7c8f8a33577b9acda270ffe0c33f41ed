The candidate for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the Saturday’s governorship poll in Ondo State, Eyitayo Jegede, has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of creating problems for voters. Jegede, who won his polling unit, also urged INEC to improve on its performances. According to him, INEC’s performance during the Edo State governorship election was very good. He stated this on Saturday while briefing newsmen at the Sacred Heart Primary School along Cathedral Road in Akure. “I expect I will win,” Jegede said shortly after casting his vote at Polling Unit 9, Ward 2 in Akure South Local Government Area. Evaluating the conduct of the election, Jegede, added: “I plead with INEC to improve on its performance. The performance of Edo was very good. “Here, at this polling unit, the voters have conducted themselves in an orderly and peaceful manner, and turnout has been massive. “Unfortunately, it’s INEC that is creating the problems for our voters, not the voters creating problems for INEC. “They will claim to be observers or INEC officials, but they stay directly behind those who are voting, giving signals to those people to go and collect money.”

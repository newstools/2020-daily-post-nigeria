FCT Minister, Muhammad Bello has said that victims of violent End SARS protests in the nation’s capital will be compensated. Bello spoke on Thursday when he and the Minister of State, Ramatu Aliyu, led an entourage of political, religious, community and traditional leaders on a tour of affected areas. At the Kabusa Junction and Apo/Waru areas, Bello commiserated with the traders for their losses. He said the government would assess the extent of their losses and work towards appropriate compensation. “For those that have been encountered with destruction of their property, by the grace of God, the FCT Administration will ensure that all that needs to be done to ensure that you get adequately compensated will be done”. Bello noted that the administration will ensure that peace and harmonious co-existence is maintained in the FCT. “All of us came here to earn a living, to find what we can do to maintain ourselves and family. I assure you that the FCT Administration will continue to ensure that your lives and properties are protected.” Bello confirmed that some arrests have been made by the police and urged residents to volunteer information to the relevant authorities. In her remarks, Aliyu reminded citizens that they were brothers and sisters regardless of ethnic or religious affiliations. The minister sued for calm in Abuja, noting that protests for the betterment of Nigeria should not have resulted in violence. At Dutsen Makaranta where a customary court and police outpost were destroyed, she said “We feel your pain. This is a court established to give justice to the people. “We will be wondering what it has got to do with the protests and properties being vandalized. This goes a long way to tell us that it’s just the work of miscreants or hoodlums targeted at government facilities”.

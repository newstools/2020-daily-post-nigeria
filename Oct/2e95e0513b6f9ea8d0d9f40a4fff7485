The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Kaduna State Chapter, has raised the alarm over a continuous rise in drug abuse and addiction among youths in the state.
The State CAN Chairman, Rev. John Hayab, made this known to newsmen in Kafanchan, Jema’a Local Government Area, NAN reports. Hayab said that the menace of drug abuse was fast eating deep into the fabric of the society, adding that swift and decisive action must be taken to savage the situation.
“CAN in Kaduna State is saying no to drug addiction and that’s why we came to Kafanchan. “We are speaking to pastors, women and youths if there’s anything they can do for us to overcome this because if you are in your senses when an enemy strikes, you will know how to react. “But when you are drunk and out of your mind, an enemy can even destroy you and you can do nothing ; you will not be useful to the society neither can you help yourself,” he said.
According to him, people who take drugs in order to summon courage to fight their enemies often turn on their families and friends when such enemies are long gone. “We must preach against drugs in our churches, in our community meetings and everywhere. “ That is why I am challenging all pastors today; If you don’t speak against drugs, the problem will only get worse. “If one gets angry and takes drugs before fighting; once there is no enemy, the next thing, the addicted person does is to turn against his family and friends,” he added.

Akinbiyi stated that “the motorcyclist rode against traffic (route violation) from Redeemed to Mowe before it ran into the truck which was on its legitimate lane heading towards Sagamu Interchange.” “The truck has been taken to Redeemed Police Station by TRACE and FRSC officials while the dead victim, including the Okada rider, have been taken to Fakoya Mortuary, Sagamu,” he said. Meanwhile, the TRACE Corps has appealed to “motorists and motorcyclists to avoid driving in a direction prohibited by traffic (One-Way) particularly on an expressway due to its attendant risk.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-848100" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201013-WA0001.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="480" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201013-WA0001.jpg 1000w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201013-WA0001-300x144.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px">

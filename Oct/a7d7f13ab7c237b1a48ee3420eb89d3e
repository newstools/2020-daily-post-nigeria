Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello has said that his administration had to clear over N50 billion in salary obligations inherited from previous administrations in the state. Gov. Bello stated this during his speech to mark Nigeria’s 60th Independent anniversary in Lokoja on Thursday. He said the bulk of that money was borrowed along with other debt obligations which according to him continued to impede the ability of the state government to free up funds for infrastructural and other development. ” Those whose actions hurt our state and people must face a reckoning,” he added. Bello who noted that the State Public Service and Pension Reforms had been a huge success, added that non-payment, late payment and percentage payment of salaries are becoming a distant memory to Kogi workers. He added that inasmuch as government revenues have always been tight since his administration assume office in 2016, the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened matters. The governor maintained that his administration would endeavour to keep meeting the wages obligations to the genuine civil servants of Kogi States. “However, Government will be taking legal action soon against some of those who compromised the system and fraudulently intercepted wages to which they were not entitled. Bringing consequences on those who compromised our workforce and payroll is one way we can forcefully deter such misconduct in future” he said.

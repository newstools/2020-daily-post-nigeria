Prince Uche Secondus, the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has advised Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State to forget the past and demonstrate the spirit of democracy by bringing everybody on board in the development of the state. Secondus gave the advice at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja, on Monday when Obaseki paid a thank-you visit to the members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP. He urged Obaseki to work with the three arms of government, especially those who offended him in the course of the last election. Secondus said: “My advice for you is that the election is over, the expectations are very high. You must now show the experience you came with from the private sector. “In the political world, it’s your ability to lead everyone together, especially in your last tenure. “It’s important to make sure that there are three arms of government – the executive which you head, even though you’re the overall boss, make sure that the legislative arm, those who have offended you, who ran helter-skelter, bring them back, they’re your children. “You’re the father of Edo, bring them on board and work with all of them because that’ll be your legacy. “It’s not money or anything else but your ability to bring everybody on board to work with you, and I’m quite sure that Edo people are ready even those from the other party, who are willing to come, let them come.” Secondus said that Obaseki’s victory was a confirmation of what God could do when men arrogate His power to themselves, urging him to continue with his humility and fear of God. “Today, Nigeria needs leaders like Obaseki and his deputy that are humble, who can listen and care for their followers.”

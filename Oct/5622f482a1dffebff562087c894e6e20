Lagos State Government has condemned the vandalization of the warehouse at Mazamaza housing the food palliative packages. They were donated by the Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) group. Abisola Olusanya, Acting Agriculture Commissioner, in a statement on Thursday, recalled that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu received the items on September 22. He said the food palliatives were “meant for distribution to the indigent”. Olusanya noted the warehouse is not state-owned and that its usage was made available to the CACOVID group. The official disclosed that Lagos was allowed to commence rebagging of those allotted to it from the quantities meant for South-West States. “The rebagging was being done to account for each beneficiary receipt, as was required and monitored by the CACOVID team. The distribution was on-going but had to be halted due to protests, before the invasion of the warehouse today. “For effective distribution of the food palliatives, groups such as Transport Unions, Ethnic Groups, Religious Associations, Artisans and Tradesmen Association, Marketmen and Women Association, People Living with Disabilities, Orphanages and Old Peoples’ Homes among others were being used as distribution channels to their members.” Olusanya regretted the invasion of the warehouse and appreciated the support offered by the CACOVID group.

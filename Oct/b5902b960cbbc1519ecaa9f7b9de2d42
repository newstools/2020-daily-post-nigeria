Ado Local Government Executive Chairman, James Oche, has condemned the killing of a police officer and a motorcyclist by gunmen in his community in Benue State on Wednesday. Oche described the act as cruel, inhuman and intolerable. He also vowed to bring the perpetrators to book at whatever cost. “The Council Boss is embittered by the development and has said there is no room for criminals and their elements in Ado further expressing his zeal to, in using the instrumentality of the law sanitize his domain,” he was quoted as saying in a statement by his Special Adviser on Security, Johnson Odey. “The chairman summoned an emergency meeting of the Local Government Security Council and thereafter personally briefed security agencies who are on course trailing the assailants. “He urges the people to remain calm, law abiding and also volunteer information that would lead to the arrest and prosecution of the killers while promising that his administration was ready for the task of ensuring the security of lives and property.” Meanwhile, the Benue State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Catherine Anene, told NAN in Makurdi on Thursday that the Force is still investigating the motive behind the attack.

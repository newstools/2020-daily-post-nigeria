United States President, Donald Trump was caught on camera on Monday struggling for breath after he left the hospital. Trump left the hospital after spending just three days in the Walter Reed Medical Center following COVID-19 diagnosis. He had last Friday announced he and his wife, Melania Trump tested positive for COVID-19 after Hope Hicks, one of his closest senior advisers was diagnosed with the virus. Trump arrived at the White House on Monday night and immediately took off his mask before doing a photo, at the balcony to salute the Marine One helicopter as it departed. In a footage, which surfaced online and now viral, the 74-year-old President appeared to be struggling to breathe and looking like he was in pain as he stood at the balcony. However, not quite long after the footage went viral, the President posted a video on his Twitter encouraging Americans not to be afraid of COVID-19.

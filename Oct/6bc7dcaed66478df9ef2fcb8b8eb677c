Arsenal’s director of football operations, Huss Fahmy, has left the club as the internal restructuring continues, ESPN reports. Fahmy arrived at the Emirates in 2017 and was responsible for the Gunners’ contract negotiations with both existing players and new signings. The North London outfit have made a few significant changes within the club, including the redundancies of 55 non-playing staff members and an overhaul of their scouting department. Raul Sanllehi also left his role as head of football suddenly in August. Technical Director, Edu and manager Mikel Arteta have since assumed greater influence in recruitment. Fahmy, a former Team Sky executive, has subsequently decided to move on in what a club spokesman insisted is an “amicable” departure. Arsenal are expected to hire a replacement but Fahmy’s successor will have a less-encompassing position and would not occupy a place on the executive team.

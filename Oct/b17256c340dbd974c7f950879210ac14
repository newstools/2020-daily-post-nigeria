The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has filed an additional proof of evidence against Malabu Oil & Gas. It was tendered before Justice I. E. Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja. The company is being accused of alleged money laundering to the tune of $USD 875,740,000. EFCC re-arraigned Malabu, Aliyu Abubakar and six others on September 8. On Tuesday, Bala Sanga, the prosecution counsel, mentioned the presence of Prosecution Witness One (PW1), Temitope Erinlomo in court. The prosecution concluded its evidence-in-chief with the PW1 on September 10. Sanga said the filing of additional proof of evidence against the first defendant, Malabu Oil & Gas Limited, was to assist the court to reach its conclusions. But defence counsel declined cross-examination of the witness on account of the prosecutionâ€™s new proof of evidence. He noted that his team was served at a short notice, arguing that they needed not less than 24 hours to go through the application. The defence further submitted that it was beyond the prosecution to determine whether the additional proof of evidence will be helpful in the matter or not. Justice Ekwo adjourned the matter until November 28, 2020.

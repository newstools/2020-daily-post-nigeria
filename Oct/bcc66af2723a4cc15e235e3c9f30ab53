An Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court on Monday arraigned three men over alleged exhumation of corpses. The defendants, Kola Fatoye, 40, Abimbola Fatoye, 35, and Ahmed Ojo, 56, are facing a charge of exhumation of corpses, NAN reports. The prosecutor, Monica Ikebuilo, told the court that the defendants committed the offence between March and September 2020, in Orun-Ekiti. She alleged that the defendants dug up graves and severed heads of corpses at St. Paul Anglican Church Cemetery in Orun-Ekiti. Ikebuilo said that the severed corpses were those of Philip Akintayo, Moreani Ajayi and eight others, and alleged that the suspects used the extracted parts of the corpses for ritual. “The charms from the ritual were found with the defendants,” she claimed. According to her, the offences contravened sections 242(1) b, 210 (e) and 213(b) of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. However, the Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adefumike Anoma, while delivering judgement ordered that the defendants be remanded at the correctional centre, pending issuance of legal advice. Anoma adjourned the case until Nov. 6 for mention.

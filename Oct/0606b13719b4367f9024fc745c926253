Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s fate as Manchester United manager could be sealed within the next three weeks, the UK Mirror reports. The Red Devils were hammered 6-1 before the international week, a result that leaves them 16th on the table. United have only won once this season, needing a 100th minute penalty to see off Brighton 3-2. Solskjaer’s men return to action with seven fixtures across three weeks. It begins this Saturday, when they travel to play Newcastle in the Premier League. After that comes a trip to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League. Their next three games will be at Old Trafford. First come Chelsea, before RB Leipzig in the Champions League. Mikel Arteta will then bring his improving Arsenal team in the league. United travel to Turkey to face Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League, before a trip to current league leaders, Everton.

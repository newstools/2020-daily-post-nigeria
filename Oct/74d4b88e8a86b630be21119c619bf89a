Manchester City, Pep Guardiola, has named Leeds United boss, Marcelo Bielsa, as the person he admires most in world football. Bielsa and Guardiola come face-to-face on Saturday afternoon, when City travel to Elland Road in the Premier League. “He is probably the person I admire the most in world football – as a manager and as a person. “I think he is the most authentic manager of all time, in terms of how he conducts his teams. He is unique. “Nobody can imitate him, it’s impossible, especially his behaviour as a person on and off the pitch. “I was fortunate sometimes to meet him, I don’t see him quite as much now. But when I get the pleasure to spend time with him, it’s always inspirational for me. “The value of the manager does not depend on how many titles he has. “My teams won more titles than him, buy in terms of knowledge of the game, I am still away from him. “His teams are always a joy to watch, how honest they are, they always want to attack and produce good football for spectators,” Guardiola said.

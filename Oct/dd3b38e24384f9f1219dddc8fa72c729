The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, has ordered the immediate detention and orderly room trial of one Inspector Adadu Innocent attached to PMF 22 Ikeja, for hitting and injuring one Kayode Jaiyeola, of the Punch newspaper at Maryland, Lagos on Thursday. The police chief, who was monitoring the deployment and operational activities of officers and men of the command for the enforcement of the order against unlawful gathering and protest by some unpatriotic individuals, raced to the scene and personally moved the injured journalist to the Police Cottage (hospital) at Area F, GRA, Ikeja, where he personally waited and ensured the injured journalist was given immediate medical treatment. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Muyiwa Adejobi, in a statement, said preliminary findings carried out by the Commissioner of Police and eye witness accounts from senior officers on the ground revealed that the officer suddenly attacked the journalist without previous altercation or confrontation. “This propelled the Commissioner of Police to order for his trial to serve as a deterrent to others who are fond of engaging in unprofessional and unethical conducts. “Odumosu urged the general public to believe in the command’s commitment to sanitizing and reforming the policing system in Lagos State in conformity with the international standards.”

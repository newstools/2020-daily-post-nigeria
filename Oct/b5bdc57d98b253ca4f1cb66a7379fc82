One person has been killed and another injured in Adamawa State following separate attacks believed to have been perpetrated by herdsmen. David Titus, identified as the youth leader (Kpalagbe) of Nega Community of Bolki Ward in Numan Local Government Area, was said to have been on his way out of his home base, Bang, when he was shot dead. Sources said the killing of David Titus took place on Saturday, October 17, a day after another Bang youth, Kennedy Bitrus escaped with injuries. Kennedy Bitrus was said to have been returning from a trip to Bang on Friday when he ran into armed men who swooped on him, dealing him blows over which he had to be rushed to the hospital. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, has confirmed both incidents. Nguroje gave no details of how the incidents occurred but said police personnel from the command headquarters had been deployed for investigation. “For now, no arrest has been made but the command has been informed. The command cannot allow anything that will frustrate existing peace achieved by the command through community engagement between farmers and herders. Our men are going after the perpetrators, possibly to arrest them and bring them to book,” Nguroje said.

President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has congratulated the newly appointed 19th Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Ahmed Nuhu Bamalli. Ambassador Ahmed Bamalli was appointed by Governor Nasir El-Rufai after a meeting with Zazzau council of chiefs. The seat was left vacant since the death of Alhaji Shehu Idris, the 18th Fulani Emir, who died on Sunday, 20th September. Reacting, Lawan, in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media, Ola Awoniyi, described Bamalliâ€™s appointment as well deserved. He expressed hope that the new Emir would meet the high expectations of the revered office and justify the trust and confidence that his people have expressed in his character and ability through his selection and appointment. Lawan also congratulated the state authorities and particularly the people of Zazzau Emirate for the peaceful and smooth transition after the painful exit of their 18th Emir. He prayed that the reign of the new Emir, like that of his predecessor, would enhance peace and development in Zazzau Emirate and Kaduna State.

A friend of Nda Ara, identified as Umar Dan’Assabe Mohammed, told DAILY POST on Monday morning that those that killed him must be brought to book. Also, a resident of the state capital who never wanted his name to be mentioned sent a text message to our correspondent in Lokoja which reads “Good evening. Could you believe that a member of my church was shot today and bled to death during the sporadic shooting? We are about starting the requiem mass now in our church. I am psychologically and emotionally down. May God take vengeance for all of these”. Another casualty recorded in Mondays brutality from the masked hoodlums is the Kogi State correspondent of the Sun Newspaper, Emmanuel Adeyemi who was hit by a stray bullet. Adeyemi was about entering the press centre of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) when he was hit by live bullets fired by the masked thugs. He is currently on admission in a private hospital.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-852209" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201026-WA0050-681x511-1.jpg" alt="" width="681" height="511" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201026-WA0050-681x511-1.jpg 681w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201026-WA0050-681x511-1-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px"> DAILY POST correspondent, who had been monitoring the health condition of Mr Adeyemi, gathered that he had a successful surgery at about 8:30PM Monday. In a reaction, the Police public relations officer, William Aya, said those who shot the journalist could be the looters who were scaring people to enable them perpetuate their nefarious acts. He said that the shootings were not from the Police officers, adding that they were being trailed and would be brought to book shortly.

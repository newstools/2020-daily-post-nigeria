Arsenal are set reopen talks with Mesut Ozil about a pay-off, which could pave the way for a move to Major League Soccer (MLS), the UK Mirror reports. Ozil, who turns 32 next week and is the club’s highest earner on £350,000-a-week, has been excluded from Mikel Arteta’s 25-man Europa League squad. The Gunners tried to reach an agreement with the player before the transfer window shut, but Ozil refused to leave the Emirates. However, Arsenal hope they can negotiate a settlement which could see Ozil leave in January. The club accepts Ozil is unlikely to leave before then, despite being left out in the cold. He is also almost certain to be dropped from the 25-man squad for the Premier League which will be confirmed October 20.

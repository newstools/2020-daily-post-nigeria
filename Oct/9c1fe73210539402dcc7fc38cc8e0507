Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has hit out at the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), following their 3-1 defeat to Real Madrid on Saturday. Federico Valverde gave the visitors the lead, before Ansu Fati levelled with a smart finish. However, a VAR review led to Madrid being awarded a penalty, with Clement Lenglet deemed to have pulled Sergio Ramos’ shirt. Ramos stepped up to make it 2-1 from the spot, before Luka Modric added a third late in the game. Koeman told Barca TV: “Every decision goes against us. In five games there have been none in our favour. “There was the [Leo] Messi penalty against Sevilla that was not given and the red card against Getafe. “Today’s penalty is just something that happens in the area.”

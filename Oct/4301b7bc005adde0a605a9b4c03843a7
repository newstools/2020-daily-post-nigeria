Members of the Ogun State House of Assembly have said they are yet to receive their constituency allowance since they were inaugurated in June 2019. This, they said, was contrary to insinuations by members of the public that the lawmakers have not been embarking on any projects despite receiving constituency allowance. The Speaker of the Ogun Assembly, Olakunle Oluomo, on Wednesday, said the members were yet to be paid their constituency project allowance. DAILY POST gathered that the lawmaker representing Ado-Odo/Ota II constituency, Musefiu Lamidi, had, during plenary, expressed concern over what he called the “misinformation in some quarters that members of the assembly had received their constituency project allowance and had failed to do the needful in their constituencies.” Lamidi stated that he was accused by his constituents of collecting constituency projects allowance from the government and had refused to use the money accordingly. Reacting, Oluomo informed that most of the projects embarked upon by the lawmakers in their various constituencies were being financed from their personal resources. “We have spent one year and a few months; no one has collected constituency project allowance because of the economic situation in the country; anything we do is from our sweat. “The assembly will not hesitate to do the needful immediately we receive any money from the government. “We will announce to the people immediately we receive money for constituency projects from the state government,” he said.

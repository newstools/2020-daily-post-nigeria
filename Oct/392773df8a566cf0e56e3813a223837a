A former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has said that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side must be ‘consistent’ in winning games for them to win the English Premier League and Champions League titles this season. Berbatov disclosed this ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash with Arsenal on Sunday. “Everyone assumed Manchester United would have a tough time against Leipzig, but they were really excellent a complete performance,” Berbatov told Betfair. “They pressed when they needed to press, attacked the ball well, passed the ball well, and they also showed that the goals are there, it’s just a matter of bringing them out. It was a great night for the team all around. “Fatigue and motivation play a part, it can be hard to switch back and forth, and a lot of it is just a coincidence too. “This result at home will do wonders for United’s confidence, as their home record hasn’t been fantastic. Not only have they won at home, but they’ve also beaten Leipzig 5-0! “That is an incredible result. Hopefully, this win will change their fortunes going forward. “Ole deserves credit for performances like this, it can’t be a situation where good results are the players, the bad results are the manager, that does not work. “I wouldn’t jump to the conclusion that United all of a sudden can win the Premier League or the Champions League, it is too early, and they need to become that word again, consistent.

Nollywood actress, Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde has asked that the family members of those who died during the Lekki tollgate incident speak up. The actress in a post via her Twitter account urged people to stop with the sensationalization if there were no deaths. According to her, “it is a Crime of Human Rights to shoot someone not pointing a gun at you or running from you.” She also said the government will still reveal who ordered the terror on peaceful protesters. “Now that the whirlwind is settling, let’s see clearly and sieve the facts from the sensation. “Remember that the Main Reason is to Stop Police Brutality in Nigeria and we still demand to know who ordered the Terror on Peaceful protesters while there’s Still No known arrests of killer MIU. “Who sent the Military and started the VIOLENCE and HOOLIGANISM. “We Demand to know who brought touts in BRT busses and OFFICIAL VEHICLES. “While the Government said SARS had ended and claimed to understand and our agitation, the people sent to rein in the enraged rioters on the streets were EXECUTING them! “This is a Crime of Human Rights! You do not shoot someone NOT pointing a gun at you or running from you! “EVERYONE who was involved in turning the protest into a Violent Rollercoaster should Now be Brought to book! “If not, then everything else is a LIE! Calling on journalists, investigators, NGOs pls we have work to do. “ No lies, No fear. If People died during the Lekki Toll Assault, let their people speak out please and if there were No deaths then enough with the sensationalization because it does not remove from the Crime that happened. “Peaceful protesters were attacked and we will like to know why and by whom,” she said. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-851289 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_5550-997x1024.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="760" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_5550-997x1024.jpg 997w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_5550-292x300.jpg 292w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_5550.jpg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

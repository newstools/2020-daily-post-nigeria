Former Manchester United striker, Diego Forlan, has predicted that fellow compatriot, Edinson Cavani will succeed at Old Trafford. Cavani, 33, is edging closer to a move to Man United before Monday’s transfer deadline. The Uruguay striker is a free agent, after ending his seven-year spell with Paris Saint-Germain this summer. “I think Cavani is going to do well [at Manchester United],” Forlan told The National. “Edinson will show his conduct and way of doing things, his professionalism, the way he works hard and trains. “It will be his conduct that other players can watch and learn from.” Cavani played the majority of his 116 caps alongside Forlan during his time with the Uruguay national team.

No fewer than 22 people were killed in the wee hours of Tuesday in Tunga Kwana community in Talata Mafara Local Government Area of Zamfara State. DAILY POST gathered that the bandits stormed the village and started shooting sporadically, killing even women and children. It was also learnt that most of the villagers who escaped into the forest and later found themselves in Talata Mafara town said that the situation was terrible as the bandits continued to unleash terror attacks on the villagers. “The sight was simply unbelievable considering the way the bandits were unleashing terror attacks on the villagers”, said a villager, Ahmed Mohammed. “Throughout their operations, there was no single security operative in the area to rescue the villagers.” According to Mohammed, the bandits have not been happy with the villagers as they had last week reported to the security operatives that the bandits have been rustling away their domestic animals. He explained that even on the day of the dastard operation; the bandits rustled so many cattle without any challenge from any security operative. When contacted, the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Mohammed Shehu, confirmed the incident, saying that 20 people were killed, not 22 as narrated by the villagers. Shehu said that armed police men have been deployed to the axis immediately the report was received, appealing to indigenes to remain calm as the security operatives were on top of the issue to fish out the bandits and bring them to book. “The security operatives in the state are not relaxing in their efforts but it is not a day job to wipe out bandits entirely in the whole state. “People should bear with us because were not happy as the insecurity situation has been escalating irrespective of all efforts to block them.”

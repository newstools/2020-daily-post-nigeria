Big Brother Naija, BBnaija finalist, Vee has revealed how ex-housemates Tacha, Mercy and Cee-c helped her overcome hatred from viewers. Vee on Thursday during her media rounds said she has been faced with death threats and referred to as a ‘Venom’ following her time in the reality show. When asked how she’s dealing with the hate and threats from some viewers, Vee said she learnt how to ignore the negative and focus on making the money. According to her, she learned not to dwell on the negatives from Tacha, Cee-cand Mercy. Vee said: “There were death threats after I left the house, some called me ‘Vee bitter leaf, Venom’ but I learnt from Tacha, Cee-c and Mercy to get over the negativity no matter the insults and keep going for the bag “So I’m not going to get into that and allow that to weigh me down. I have chosen to be with people that care about me instead.”

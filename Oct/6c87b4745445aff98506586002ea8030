The Buhari volunteers movement has said the End SARS protest was perpetrated by unpatriotic, blood thirsty miscreants, separatist as well as agents of destruction of Nigeria. Coordinator of BVM, Jigawa state chapter, Musa Gambo Guri disclosed this in a press statement issued to DAILY POST. He said the protest in its original form was a step in the right direction and commendable due to the fact that some SARS officers were taking undue advantage of the organization to harass and intimidate innocent citizens. Gambo explained that peaceful protest is lawful but unconstitutional for any group to stage a violent protest under whatever condition. “Any protest where looting, arson and rape becomes the order of the day, that protest is no longer constitutional.” The movement, therefore, commended President Buhari for approving the genuine demand of End SARS protesters and approval of N75b to help Nigerian youth. It, therefore called on Nigerian Youths to join hand and support Mr president in his quest to end banditry and eradicate corruption.

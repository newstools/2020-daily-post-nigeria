Hundred of mothers in Lagos have joined the End SARS protest. They marched around the Agege area of the state on Friday afternoon. They carried placards and chanted songs during the procession. They are equally demanding the proscription of the notorious Police unit. The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) has been infamous for extra-judicial activities. The federal government and the Police insist on reform. But citizens and bodies, including Amnesty International, insist on complete scrap. AI said Nigerian authorities’ inaction over the years emboldened SARS agents to operate with impunity.

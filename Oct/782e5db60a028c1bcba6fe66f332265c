Pope Francis, the head of the Catholic Church, has urged everyone to pray for Nigeria. The Bishop of Rome made the call on Sunday. He said supplications were needed to forestall further civil disorder in Africa’s most populous country. “Let us pray to the Lord for Nigeria, so that every form of violence might always be avoided, in the constant search of social harmony through the promotion of justice and the common good”, he tweeted. There has been widespread violence after the End SARS protests demanding an end to police brutality went awry. Scores have died across the country and hundreds injured. The international community has appealed for calm and urged Nigerian authorities to probe the use of force by security operatives.

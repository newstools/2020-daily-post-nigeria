The Forum of APC State Chairmen has debunked the purported 14-day ultimatum given to its National caretaker committee to set up a convention committee. The ruling party says the order given by a group called “Concerned All Progressives Congress is baseless, as it is an unknown group in the all progressives Congress family. This is part of a statement issued by the Kebbi State APC Chairman Arc Bala Sani Kangiwa on behalf of the Forum of APC state chairmen after its meeting at headquarters in Abuja. Arc Kangiwa said the forum unanimously condemns any attempt to distract efforts of the APC Caretaker Committee led by the Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni. The forum assured that the group are not members of the APC
He said the APC has recognizable processes through which members can lodge any legitimate grievance and that shadowy groups, with questionable agenda, could not claim any concern for the party The statement explained that ‘‘the Chairman of the APC Caretaker Committee (CTC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, Wednesday, 14th October 2020, met with the APC States Chairmen, at the National Headquarters of the party in Abuja and briefed them on the progress so far made on their assignment, from inception to date’’. ‘‘The entire APC state chairmen are pleased and proud of what the Buni led caretaker committee has achieved so far and the committee assures the support of the entire APC members across the country’’ Kangiwa noted that the party is getting more united with more people joining, maintaining that the party’s victory at the Ondo State governorship election is a reflection of its successes.

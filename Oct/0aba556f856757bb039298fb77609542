The head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has confirmed that the training camp for next month’s 2021 African Cup of Nations double-header against Sierra Leone will open November 9. Rohr, speaking with NationSport, said he was fine-tuning the squad list for the two matches, which will be played in Benin on November 13 and Freetown on November 17. The German, however, confirmed that injured pair of Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi and Bordeaux’s Samuel Kalu would be major omissions. “Yes, we are playing in Benin. “On Monday, November 9, we will open the camp,” he said. Early this month, Rohr blooded some new players during the two preparatory matches against Algeria and Tunisia in Austria ahead of the AFCON qualifiers. The experiment saw some newly-invited including the likes of Zaidu Sanusi (FC Porto, Portugal), Frank Onyeka (FC Midtjylland, Denmark), Samson Tijani (TSV Hartberg, Austria), Cyriel Dessers (KRC Genk, Belgium), and Chidera Ejuke (CSKA Moscow, Russia) being handed their first outings in the national team colours. Nigeria currently lead Group L with six points after winning their opening two matches at home against Benin and away against Lesotho.

British-Nigerian Actor, John Boyega has joined Nigerians on social media in the ongoing #EndSARS campaign around the country. Nigerian celebrities and youths on Thursday led a peaceful protest around Lagos State and other parts of the country. The #EndSARS movement has gained momentum in the past few days. Boyega on his Twitter page said the reform of SARS three years ago has done nothing for Nigerians and, therefore, needs urgent attention. He called on the present administration and leaders to immediately pay attention to the pleas of Nigerians as many are in danger. Boyega in a series of tweets on his verified Twitter page wrote: “ Three years ago Nigeria’s police chief re-organised SARS after public condemnation about the violence that came with their operations. That change has done nothing for Nigerians and today many are still in danger. #EndSarsProtests “We can’t simply enjoy Banana island every December without noticing the concrete wall placed between Nigerians and their potential. The limitations become unbearable for them and this needs serious attention. “The youth in Nigeria deserve good leadership and guidance. This situation is tied to many other issues. “Please lend your attention to this pressing problem! Meanwhile, DAILY POST reported that some men of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) threw teargas canisters at peaceful protesters in Abuja on Friday. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847096" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_9892.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="1036" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_9892.jpg 828w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_9892-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_9892-818x1024.jpg 818w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px">

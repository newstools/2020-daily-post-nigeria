Borno State governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum, has lamented that insurgency has forced Borno citizens to become unproductive, adding that most have completely lost their means of livelihood. He warned that Borno State currently has over 50,000 orphans without access to any form of education, stressing that, with over 50,000 young men growing up without education there is a serious threat to national security as the future of the young men did not spell good fortune for Nigeria. Zulum who was speaking during a lecture at the National Institute for security studies in Abuja observed that, for Nigeria to attain sustainable national development and security, there has to be commitments on the part of leaders and the followers. He attributed the crises in most parts of the country to the obsolete/inadequate equipment and personnel deployed for the job. He noted that while other countries are talking of artificial intelligence and other forms of technologies in their security architecture, Nigeria is still digging trenches to protect her citizens. According to him, national security and sustainable development are two sides of the same coin, saying without security there will be no development. Zulum, who lamented the quality of education in the country, stressed that Universities have become mere edifices producing unproductive graduates. He further cautioned Nigerians not to take the security crisis in the northeast as a regional affair, saying; “the insurgency is not our problem alone, let’s act or it will consume all of us”. “It’s a pity when others are talking about education and infrastructure development in the rural areas, we’re struggling to feed our people.” Governor Zulum said

A musician, Amzat Ibrahim, on Thursday told an Ile-Tuntun Customary Court in Ibadan that his wife Zainab, is an adulterer who slept with his best friend. Amzat made the allegations in a counter statement after Zainab prayed for divorce on grounds that her life was being threatened. “My lord, the truth is that Zainab and I fight because of her infidelity. Zainab and my close friend are romantically involved. ”She disappeared from my house for three months. She took my children away. I later found out that she took them to a friend’s house. “I caught the two of them in bed,” Amzat said. In her defence, Zainab told the court that her husband was threatening her life. She alleged that he humiliates and insults her around town. “He keeps monitoring my movements,” she added. Following the development, the president of the court, Chief Henry Agbaje, advised the couple to substantiate their claims before a court. Agbaje asked them to produce two of their relatives each in court. He adjourned the case until November 2 for judgment, NAN reports.

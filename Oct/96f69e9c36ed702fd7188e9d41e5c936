The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Thursday, urged the United States, US, and the United Kingdom, UK, to impose a visa ban on political stakeholders involved in any form electoral malpractice during the Saturday’s governorship election in Ondo State. HURIWA made the call while applauding the UK, US, embassies in Nigeria for taking measures to help Nigeria clean up its electoral system. National Coordinator of HURIWA, Emmanuel Onwubiko, stated this in a statement he forwarded to DAILY POST on Thursday. According to HURIWA: “We specifically urge the UK and US embassies to follow through with their threats to impose visa ban on the electoral officials if the weekend’s Ondo State governorship election is undermined.” The rights group urged voters to resist any attempt by politicians to lure them into thuggery. The statement added: “HURIWA hereby appeals to young voters in Ondo State never to accept to be lured into becoming political thugs in the state for any politician because their future should be uppermost in their minds and in their calculations. The youths who are approached to take up arms for politicians should ask the politicians to bring their own biological children and to stop attempting to destroy their future.” The frontline rights group said the youths are saddled with the responsibility of ensuring a peaceful governorship election on Saturday. HURIWA said youths should demand that children of politicians lead violence if asked to cause mayhem during the Saturday’s election.

Aisha Yesufu, co-convener of BringBackOurGirls, BBOG, advocacy group, has reacted to the attack on those protesting against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, in Abuja. Yesufu warned that the attack on anti-SARS protesters will not deter youths from the ongoing campaign. The activist noted that youths are resilient and intelligent, hence will not back down from the protest due to the attacks. In a post on Facebook, she wrote: “Nigerian government needs to be careful. “Sending hoodlums to attack #SARSMUSTEND protesters in Abuja the way they did to BBOG members in 2014 will not work now the way it didn’t then. “The youth have resilience and intelligence. Don’t mess with them #SARSMUSTEND.” Recall that armed thugs had attacked peaceful protesters in Abuja. The thugs armed with cutlasses and sticks had attacks protesters in Berger area of Abuja.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest injury update on Hakim Ziyech, Christian Pulisic and Billy Gilmour ahead of the Blues’ Premier League clash with Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon at Stamford Bridge. Ziyech, Pulisic and Gilmour have been sidelined in the past few weeks due to injury. The trio missed Chelsea’s previous matches against Barnsley, West Brom and Tottenham Hotspur. But Lampard is now saying that Ziyech and Gilmour are far away to return, while Pulisic is in the squad to face Crystal Palace. “Pulisic is in the squad for tomorrow,” Lampard said at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “He won’t start the match because of the injury he’s had, and it’s been a difficult injury, but I am very keen to get him back in there. “It’s great to have him back for himself and for the boost he gives the team because he’s an important player for us. Hakim Ziyech is getting closer, but he’s not quite fit enough to be on the bench.” Lampard added: “Billy is progressing well. It was forecast as a four-month injury when he went into surgery, and we are three months on from that, so it will be four weeks from now that he’ll be hopefully fit barring any hiccups.” The kick-off time for the game is 12:30 pm, Nigerian time.

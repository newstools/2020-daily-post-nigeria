Al-Nassr have made a £5million offer for Arsenal midfielder, Mesut Ozil, according to TYC Sports. The Saudi Arabian club is keen to land the 31-year-old World Cup winner. Ozil has not played for the Gunners since March 7. He has been frozen out of the Arsenal first team by manager Mikel Arteta ever since football resumed after the lockdown. Arteta also left him out of the 25-man Europa League squad for the 2020/2021 campaign. Although Ozil might never play for the club again, the German playmaker is willing to run down his £350,000-a-week contract which expires in June. Ozil is understood not to be interested in the two-year deal put forward by Al Nassr.

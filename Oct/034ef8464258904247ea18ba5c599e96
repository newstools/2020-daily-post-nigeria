A 2023 presidential campaign poster of Atiku Abubakar, former Vice President on Saturday, surfaced online. The campaign poster of Atiku, who was a former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, posted on Twitter by a political analyst, Olushola Olufolabi. In the poster, Atiku was presented in Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba attires signifying the three main geopolitical zones in the country. Messages on the campaign poster in the three languages read: “Atiku Kawai 2023, Atiku Nikan 2023, Naani Atiku 2023.” A tweet accompanying the poster by Olufolabi described the former Vice President as a unifier. “ATIKU !! The practical unifier, join @AtikuKawai2023 to make it happen!,” Olufolabi tweeted. As at the time of filing this report, neither Atiku or his media aides have reacted to the campaign poster.

Legendary Nigerian musician, Innocent ‘Tuface’ Idibia, has thrown his weight behind the ongoing protest against police brutality in the country. Tuface said Nigeria should be shut down completely, amid the End SARS protest. In a tweet on his verified Twitter handle, the Benue-born singer said Nigerians should stop going to work until politicians were made to answer for bad governance. Tuface said only markets should be allowed to open. “I wonder why everybody is still going to work. We need a total shutdown until these politicians start to answer!! Unless they want to use SARS to pursue us to go work #EndSARS. “#EndPoliceBrutality #endimpunity #endlooting, only market for essential things should open,” he wrote.

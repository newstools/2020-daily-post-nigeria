In just a few days after emerging winner of the 2020 edition of the Big Brother Nigeria reality TV show and barely 24 hours of receiving the N85 million grand prize, a lady, whose name is yet to be confirmed, has surfaced on social media claiming to have a child for Laycon. In viral Video, she alleged that the BBN star had sex with her after a party at QILOX, a popular destination for topshots in Lagos. The Lady said that after the “one night stand” the Big Brother Naija star gave her his contact which she found to be not correct when she tried to reach out to him. The lady said later on, she started throwing up and noticing other symptoms of pregnancy a few months after the sexual intercourse occurred between them. She claimed that she decided to voice out when she saw Laycon on the popular BBnaija show. Laycon has, however, reacted to the claim through his handlers, led by Nollywood actress Scarlet Gomez. Gomez described the video as false, saying the BBN Lockdown winner doesn’t know the lady and has never met her. In her words: “We don’t know her and Laycon has never seen her.” See video #Laycon‘s baby mama surfaces in just a few hours after he received N85m grand prize… ladies want their share pic.twitter.com/0rCSHVPnln — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) October 1, 2020

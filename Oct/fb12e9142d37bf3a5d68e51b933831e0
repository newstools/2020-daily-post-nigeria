The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has confirmed that two people were involved in a liquid gas truck accident along Kubwa express road, Abuja. The Corps Public Education Officer (CPEO), ACM Bisi Kazeem, who disclosed this to NAN on Thursday in Abuja said that rescue operations were still ongoing at the scene of the accident involving the truck. He said two male adults were involved in the lone accident. “One male adult was injured with bruises and leg pain and has been moved to the Kubwa General Hospital. He said that the accident occurred at the early hours of Thursday while the call came in at about 8:18 am noting that the response team arrived at 8:22am. “The fire service is still there with our men and also with the police. So far, we have been able to move one casualty to the Kubwa General Hospital.” On the possible cause of the accident, Kazeem said that observations revealed that the tanker had lost control. “It was a loss of control and the tanker fell. Although an investigation is still on, we can’t just be accurate for now,” he said.
Kazeem urged tanker owners to put in place safety valves to avoid spillage of the content of tankers in case of crashes.

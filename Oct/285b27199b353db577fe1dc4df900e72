The Nigerian Senate on Thursday confirmed Alhaji Isa Kwarra from Nasarawa State as Chairman of the National Population Commission. The confirmation followed a satisfactory report of the Senate Committee on National Identity and National Population Commission. Chairman of the Committee, Senator Ahmed Saidu Alkali, said the nominees were screened and found satisfactory with the requisite qualifications to serve as Chairman and Commissioners. According to him, there was no petition from anywhere that would have encumbered their nomination, hence, the Committee recommended their confirmation by the Committee of the whole.

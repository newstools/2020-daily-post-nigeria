Rivers State Executive Council has approved the employment of five thousand youths into the State Civil Service. The approval was given during its meeting on Wednesday 28th, October 2020, which was presided over by Governor Nyesom Wike and held at Government House, Port Harcourt on Wednesday. Briefing journalists after the meeting, the State Commissioner for Employment Generation and Empowerment, Sylvanus Nwankwo said the youths must not be more than 35 years. He said there are existing vacancies in the civil service needing Engineers, Lawyers, Medical Doctors, Technicians and other fields that youths could fill. Also addressing newsmen, the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim said the recruitment drive undertaken by the Wike administration will cushion the employment gap in the state. Nsirim also said the council approved that civil servants that were asked to stay back at home during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown are to resume work on Monday 2nd November 2020. “Civil servants on grade level 1 to 10 who have been at home because of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown are to resume work Monday, November 2nd 2020. Similarly, bars that have been closed down since COVID-19 lockdown are to open, while night clubs will remain closed” he said.

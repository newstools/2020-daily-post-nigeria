The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun has expressed sympathy with teachers in Ogun State over what it described as the “unimpressive working conditions which Ogun teachers are subjected to by the ruling government” of Governor Dapo Abiodun. As the world celebrates Teachers’ Day on Monday, the PDP alleged that “Ogun teachers’ statutory monthly renumerations are being diverted to private vaults; other standing emoluments, gratuity, pensions and even leave bonuses are not being paid as at when due.” The party emphatically stated that teachers have never had it so bad in Ogun, saying their high sense of perseverance is applauded. In the spirit of this year’s Teachers’ Day, the PDP challenged the ruling government of Gov Abiodun to re-order its priority by exhibiting unwavering commitment to the plights of Ogun teachers. In a statement made available to DAILY POST by its Spokesman, Akinloye Bankole, on Monday, the Ogun PDP restated its commitments and solidarity with the teachers and other workers in the State. “Your cause shall continue to be our cause as we remain resolute in championing a reign of a better future for all in Ogun state and beyond,” Bankole disclosed. The statement reads in part: “The Ogun state chapter of the People’s Democratic Party(PDP) joins Nigerians in celebrating the entire members of Nigerian Union of Teachers(NUT) and in particular, Ogun State Teachers as the world observes Teachers’ Day today. “For us as a party with a long standing tradition of excellent working relationship with members of the working class, especially the teachers in Ogun state, we have always held that teachers’ welfare and entitlements deserve priority attention by any sane government. Teachers are the central factors that drive every other sectors in social engineering.”

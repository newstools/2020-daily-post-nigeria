The Federal Government of Nigeria has ordered the reopening of all schools in the country. This is after about six months of shutting down in order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Adamu Adamu, the Minister of Education, disclosed this during a press briefing in Abuja. The minister further advised all schools to adhere to the guidelines for the reopening of schools. The minister said all unity schools should open by October 12, “while states and private schools will determine their own modalities of reopening. “We have consulted widely with all stakeholders in the education sector. Our eyes and ears are opened to the international media. I’m glad to report that there has not been any single case of COVID-19 in all Unity Schools. No single fatality among the students,” he said. “We have come to the conclusion that we have to review our decisions. After consultation with PTF, we have resolved that our Unity Schools be opened on October 12, 2020.”

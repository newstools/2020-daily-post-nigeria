Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has said “disgraceful” players at the club will cost Ole Gunnar Solskjaer his job. Keane labelled United players as “bluffers”, following their 6-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur. “I’ve been saying it for the last 12 months, year and a half, their performance against Spurs was disgraceful. “You all have bad days in football. Some of the players were a disgrace to the Man United badge. “Too many bluffers and ultimately, these players will cost Ole his job. The players he has got there – they threw the previous manager under the bus. They will do the same to Ole,” Keane told ITV ahead of England vs Wales. United currently sit in 16th place in the Premier League after losing two of their first three fixtures.

Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has urged End SARS protesters to vacate access roads in the state. Sanwo-Olu urged the protesters to leave the roads and embrace dialogue. He made the appeal in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile entitled: ‘Leave The Road And Let’s Dialogue, Sanwo-Olu Appeals To Protesters’. Youths protesting against police brutality have taken over major roads and highways in Lagos State. However, Sanwo-Olu said: “We have shown unprecedented commitment to the complete overhaul of the Nigerian Police. The inauguration of this Judicial Panel of Inquiry is only the first step in a long line of reformative actions that will lead to a thorough revamp and reorientation of the Nigeria Police. “I believe that some of the actions we have taken should, to a large extent, show our sincerity and willingness to address all your concerns. “Let me reiterate that I am on the side of the young people out there. I understand your pain and I know your concerns are genuine and legitimate.”

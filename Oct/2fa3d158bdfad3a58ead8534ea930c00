Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that midfielder, Bruno Fernandes will captain the Red Devils in Harry Maguire’s absence, when they face Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League group stage fixture on Tuesday night in France. Maguire sustained a slight injury on Saturday in Man United’s 4-1 victory against Newcastle United in the Premier League. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Monday, Solskjaer said: “We hope Harry will be fit for the weekend [for the Chelsea game] but we are not sure. “The captain is sitting next to me. Bruno will captain the team tomorrow [Tuesday].” The kick-off time for the match is 8 pm.

Yiaga Africa has said that the Ondo State governorship election was marred with vote buying. The Civil Society Organisation also cited inadequate compliance with COVID-19 protocol. Aisha Abdullahi, Co-chair, Yiaga Africa 2020 Ondo Election Observation Mission, spoke at a press conference on situational report. She commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for early arrival of materials to polling units. The mission leader said they received reports of vote buying from Akure South, Ose, Ondo West, Ilaje and Akure North with the secrecy of the ballot compromised. Yiaga lamented that a number of electoral offenses occurred in the presence of security personnel. The body decried that they made no attempt in some cases to reprimand the culprits. Abdullahi said they observed compliance with INEC COVID-19 protocol on the two-tier queuing system in 88% of polling units, the presence of infrared thermometer and disinfectant/sanitizers in 74% of polling units. The body hailed Ondo people for their conduct during the voting process and pleaded they remain patient and peaceful. The final results of the election are expected to be announced on Sunday.

The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Kaduna State chapter, has enjoined citizens to be law abiding and respect constituted authorities for peaceful coexistence in the state. Rev. John Joseph Hayab made the call today in Kaduna while in a zoom meeting with members of the association. He noted that the 24-hour curfew imposed in the state was as a result of the current attack on some private and government properties including tge looting of warehouses in the state capital. The state chairman appealed to all ministers of God to closed down their churches today (Sunday) in compliance with the governmentâ€™s imposition of the 24-hour curfew. He also appealed to Christian youths in the state to shun acts that would undermine the peace that the state is enjoying, saying that the association is on her feet to suggest ways to government that will be to the interest of the entire citizens. Though, a member at the meeting advised the government to as a matter of urgency empty their warehouses as many have been living from hand to mouth and may be tempted to do the wrong thing to get what to eat. The chairman regretted the level of damages done to private and public properties and prayed that the act will stop for good.

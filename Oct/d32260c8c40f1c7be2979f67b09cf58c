All the 44 aspiring Local Government Chairmen and their Councillors are to undergo narcotic drug tests, before been allowed to fully participate in the forthcoming February 2021 scheduled Kano Local Government elections. This hint was dropped by the Kano State Commissioner for Local Governments, Alhaji Murtala Sule Garo, urging the prospective contestants to subject themselves to drug tests. Sule Garo insisted that the drug test would go along way in ensuring that leaders who are paramount in the dispensation of democratic norms are free from being addicts for people to enjoy benefits of the system. The commissioner made the call at a two-day workshop organized to create awareness on drug and substance abuse at the local government level. The workshop was organized by the state government in collaboration with the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency, (NDLEA), Kano State Command. “I am calling on all Chairmanship and Councilorship contestants in the forthcoming local government elections to undergo drug tests with NDLEA to ensure that public office holders are not addicts,” he said. Garo said the workshop became necessary to curtail the menace of drug abuse in Kano, especially at the grassroots. He added that soon, the state government will conduct drug tests on employees of Local Government Councils in the State. The NDLEA Commander in Kano, Dr Ibrahim Abdul, while speaking, noted the side effects of drug abuse and said the sensitization was very timely. The workshop was attended by senior officers of the 44 local government areas of Kano State.

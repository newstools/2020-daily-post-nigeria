Abia Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu has directed that the curfew in the State be relaxed to now take effect from 6pm to 6am from Sunday, 25th October, 2020. The Governor also directed all markets in the State to be reopened during the day, while Market committees should mobilize adequate security teams to watch over the markets at night and during the day. The directive was contained in a release by the State Commissioner for Information, John Okiyi Kalu and made available to DAILY POST on Saturday morning. Governor Ikpeazu further directed all commercial tricycle operators to henceforth vacate the roads during the curfew time of 6pm-6am daily to avoid being caught in the evil plans of armed urchins who want to hide under the noble cause of genuine EndSARS protests to perpetuate acts of brigandage, arson, armed robbery and other violent crimes According to the release, “tricycle operators that fail to heed this directive will have themselves to blame as security agents have been authorized to impound and detain erring operators with their tricycles till the current curfew regime is lifted. “Public and private schools will remain closed till further notice”.

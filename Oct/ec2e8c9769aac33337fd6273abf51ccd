Atletico Madrid midfielder, Thomas Partey, is set to quadruple his salary after agreeing to personal terms with Arsenal over a £250,000-a-week deal at the Emirates, the UK Guardian reports. Partey is set to join the Gunners in a sensational deadline day switch. The 27-year-old was one of Mikel Arteta’s two major targets this summer, with Houssem Aouar choosing to remain at Lyon. Arsenal however knew that they only needed to trigger Partey’s £45m release clause to push through a deal. However, the club have been desperately trying to balance the books before moving for Partey and the club are expected to offload the likes of Sead Kolasinac, Sokratis and Matteo Guendouzi before the window closes. Partey will earn around £250,000-a-week with the Gunners and that represents a significant raise on his £60,000-a-week wages at Atletico. It’s claimed the club have also agreed to pay Partey’s representatives a seven-figure sum. Partey is currently undergoing a medical in Madrid.

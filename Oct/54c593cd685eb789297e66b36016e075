Peter Obi, a former Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Vice Presidential candidate, and former Senator, Ben Murray-Bruce, have reacted to the selection of Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as two final candidates in the race to lead the World Trade Organization (WTO). DAILY POST had reported that WTO members on Wednesday selected two final candidates for the final round. They are: Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and South Korea’s Yoo Myung-hee. With the two women advancing to the final round of the selection process, the WTO will likely have the first female director-general in its 25-year history. Reacting, Ben Bruce and Peter Obi congratulated Okonjo-Iweala who served as Nigeria’s Finance Minister for making it into the finals. Ben Bruce wrote, “I congratulate my sister, @NOIweala on making it into the final two amongst contenders to lead the WTO.” Peter Obi tweeted, “Dearest Sister @NOIweala, My sincere congratulations on your selection as one of the final two. “God Almighty who sees your goodness and commitment to a better Africa and the world will grant you success. God bless you always.”

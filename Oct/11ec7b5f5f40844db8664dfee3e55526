Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has hailed his side’s resilience following their 2-1 win at Rapid Vienna. The Gunners began their Europa League fixture with victory, despite going behind to a Taxiarchis Fountas goal. David Luiz headed in Nicolas Pepe’s free-kick, before substitute Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang finished off a fine team move. Arteta told a press conference after the game: “We knew it was going to be a difficult match. We made it harder in the beginning with the goal we conceded. “I really like the reaction. The second half we understood much better the spaces we have to attack. “In general we scored two good goals, the second was fantastic. We are delighted to start with victory.”

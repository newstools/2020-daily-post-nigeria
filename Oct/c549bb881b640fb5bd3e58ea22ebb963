A grandmother, Anthonia Amos, who was arrested by the Police for selling her four day old grandson in Imo State, has said she traded the baby because of her anger towards her son-in-law. Anthonia said she sold the baby because she was angry that the father of the baby did not pay her daughter’s bride price before putting her in a family way. She made the confession while speaking with newsmen as she was being paraded by the Rivers State police command with two others who were allegedly involved in the crime. The suspect alleged the baby’s father provided only N1000 for the hospital bills when her daughter was in labour. “I was only trying to hide the news of the pregnancy from my family and my husband who would have blamed me for not bringing up his daughter properly. I was pushed into selling the baby to anyone who would love and care for him. “I received N500,000 for the baby out of which I gave the nurse, Pauline Umoh N100,000 for the treatment and I intended to give my daughter N50,000 to take care of herself,” she said. Officers at the Trans-Amadi Police station, who apprehended the woman, said the arrest of the grandmother led to the arrest of Pauline Umoh of Ukanafu LGA of Akwa-Ibom state and Juliet Obianwa of Mgbidi in Imo state who bought the baby. Juliet Obianwa narrated that she was told that the baby is from an Orphanage Home and she was asked to pay one million naira to regularize the adoption processes. “I was looking for a baby boy to adopt that was what led me to the incident,” Juliet said.

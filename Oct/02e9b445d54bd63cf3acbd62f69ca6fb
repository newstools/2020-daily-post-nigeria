Prophet Jeremiah Fufeyin, the Senior Prophet of Christ Mercyland Deliverance Ministry, has charged Christians and Nigerians, especially clerics to pray against another civil war. Fufeyin said this while reacting to the violence that erupted across the country following calls for an end to police brutality and Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The cleric who predicted the situation on 22nd of June, 2020 called on the church to pray fervently because keeping quiet over the situation spells doom. He had warned in June, 2020 that some people were planning war, stressing that the development would shake the country and leave the country in a devastating catastrophe. The Prophet had said, “Let us pray for our country Nigeria. There are different things that are about to happen. The country is shaking. Everybody is talking about the story, even small children. Some people will say how did these things come about, other would say God was doing it. “Let us pray for Nigeria, somethings that I am seeing, I have never seen before. The things that are about to happen, if it is good for the country, it should manifest to reality but if it is bad, let it be cancelled. “As a prophet, what is about to happen, every household, every media, news houses will carry it. Let us pray that is red light. There is struggle. I can’t bare it, I can’t stand it, I don’t know whether it is truth or not. “I am seeing death,” Fufeyin said. Also, in a viral video on Thursday, Fufeyin prayed for people who have lost their lives, their families, the Nigerian Government and everyone hurting in the country. He said, “Don’t keep quiet. Things are happening in uncontrollable manner. If you think the things that are happening in Edo, Lagos, Rivers, Delta, Ibadan wouldn’t affect you, you may be wrong,” He added the church would be strategic in helping to tame the tide.

Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, will be without three key players when they host Midtjylland in the Champions League tie at Anfield on Tuesday night due to injury. The three players are Joel Matip, Naby Keita and Thiago Alcantara. Klopp disclosed this during his pre-match press conference on Monday. Klopp’s men head to the game following a 2-1 victory over Sheffield United in the Premier League on Saturday. Asked if they [Matip, Keita and Alcantara] would be fit to feature against the Danish side, Klopp said: “I do not think so. “It is still what I said last week, we look day by day, but it looks like we will need a few more days. “So, for tomorrow night, they will probably not be ready.” The time for the match is at 9 pm, Nigerian time.

Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has expressed his sincere support to Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, after the Portugal captain had contracted COVID-19 ahead of both sides’ Champions League clash on October 28. Messi wished Ronaldo a speedy recovery from the virus. Ronaldo initially tested positive for COVID-19 on October 13 while on international duty for Portugal, forcing him to withdraw from the squad and self-isolate. The 35-year-old missed Juventus’ two games against Crotone and Dynamo Kyiv respectively. “Obviously when Cristiano played for Real Madrid the games were special,” Messi told DAZN ahead of Barcelona’s El Clasico clash with Real Madrid this weekend. “Matches against them always are [special], but with Cristiano on the pitch they took on a particular significance. “That is now in the past, and we look forward to today’s challenges. Wednesday there could be this challenge, and we hope Cristiano can be there and will soon recover from Covid.” Messi added: “The [matches I played] with Cristiano were and are special duels which will remain forever. “They last many years, and it is not easy to maintain those levels for such a long time. “The duel between Cristiano and me was very good on a personal level, and I think people enjoyed it. The fans of Real, Barca, but in general all football fans, have seen a great show. We hope to give them even more emotions [on Wednesday].” Messi and Ronaldo have won eleven Ballon d’Or awards between them.

The Serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church (CGCC), Pastor Tunde Bakare, has warned the President Muhammadu Buhari administration not to kill Nigerians. Bakare, speaking on The Platform, a special programme to commemorate Nigeria’s Independence Day anniversary, on Thursday asked the federal government to get rid of corruption instead. Buhari, during his 60th Independence Day speech, intimated that fuel will soon sell for N161 per litre. According to him, fuel subsidies were being paid into private pockets. “Don’t kill Nigerians, kill corruption. Because we knew that the subsidy being paid is going into private pockets,” the cleric said. Bakare also recalled that when he joined Nobel laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka; Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Femi Falana; among others to protest during Goodluck Jonathan’s government in 2012, the protest was not against subsidy. “I campaigned against the oppression of the poor,” Bakare said, adding that the subsidy by the government was not used to advance the cause of the poor.

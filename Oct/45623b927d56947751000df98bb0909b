Alor community in Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State has allegedly dethroned Igwe MacAnthony Okonkwo. Okonkwo, who was deposed on Sunday by the Alor People’s Assembly, was among 13 traditional rulers who were accused of travelling to Abuja with oil magnate, Prince Arthur Eze, without permission from the state governor, Chief Willie Obiano. As sanction for disobedience, Anambra State government had slammed a one-year suspension on the monarchs, but Alor community accused Okonkwo of gross misconduct besides the ill-fated trip, necessitating his removal. In his place, the community selected Chief Ebelechukwu Chukwumesili as the new monarch of the community. Chukwumesili was presented to Alor people by the Ifite section of the town, and adopted as the monarch-elect by the community at a town hall meeting presided over by the President-General of Alor People’s Assembly, Chief Uzoma Igbonwa. He was later crowned by the kingmaker of Uruezena village, Alor, Edwin Ezeoke, while the traditional staff of office was handed over to him by Eze Ofo of Alor, Chief Gibson Onyekaonwu of Umuoshi village. Minister of Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige, who hailed from the community and also attended the meeting on Sunday expressed confidence that the new monarch would rule the people well, restore peace and build bridges of friendship amongst his people which he said eluded the community in the old order. Ngige said, “You can see the mood of the town’s people; joy all over the place because it was a tortuous journey but I told them to abide by the rule of law. Alor people spent seven years in court to get their town’s government legitimated. “And the town’s government put in process the election of a new Eze Di Ora Mma in accordance with the constitution of Alor people”. “Everybody is happy with the development; I’m happy with my people. I’m a man of rule of law,” the minister said.

Tension has been reported within the Oyigbo axis of the boundary between Rivers and Abia State following report of abduction and killing of a Police officer by some hoodlums. DAILY POST gathered that the Police Officer who is attached to Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS is said to be a native of Enugu State and was allegedly abducted and killed by hoodlums suspected to be members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB in the area. The slain officer who was believed to be on special duty around Oyigbo reportedly took permission from his squad leader to go out in search of food, Wednesday night when he was abducted, taken to a bush path and slaughtered by his killers. A source within the area said, “passersby who saw the dead body of the police alerted the Oyigbo Divisional Police who dispatched officers attached to tactical units of Operation Sting and Anti-Cultism and others to curtail the activities of the rampaging hoodlums who later retreated to a neighbouring state after the exchange of fire”. A senior officer who was part of the operation revealed that the hoodlums mutilated the body of the deceased officer indicating that the officer was killed, “in a very cruel manner.” When contacted, Spokesman of Rivers State Police Command, SP Nnamdi Omoni confirmed the incident but said details of the development are still sketchy. The Rivers State Police Command had in a pre-Independence Day address warned hoodlums acting in the guise of the proscribed IPOB members to stay off the state or face the full wrath of the law.

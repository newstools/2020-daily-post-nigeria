President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday called the Oba of Lagos, Rilwanu Akiolu, to convey best wishes to him on the occasion of his 77th birthday. Malam Garba Shehu, Buhari’s spokesman, said this in a statement on Thursday. He disclosed that the president again commiserated with the traditional ruler on the recent violence that led to the loss of lives and property in Lagos. ”The President recalled his long association and friendship with the Oba and appreciated the personal role that the latter has played in nurturing the peace and development of Lagos state and nation as a whole,” Shehu said. The Oba’s palace was burgled last week. His staff of office, artefacts, valuables, shoes, were carted away. Rituals for Akiolu’s return to his official residence at Iga Idugaran, Lagos Island, have been completed. The palace was originally built in 1670.

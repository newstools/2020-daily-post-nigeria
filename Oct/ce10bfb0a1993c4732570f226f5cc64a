Uma Ukpai, popular evangelist, has slammed members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and the Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB, over their agitation for a new country. Ukpai, who is the founder of a 50-year-old Uma Ukpai Evangelistic Association, stressed that those pushing for the actualisation of Biafra are mad people. The clergyman made the remark while addressing members of his ministry in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, on Tuesday, NAN reports. According to Ukpai, “There will always be crazy people, even when people are seen to be normal. “Whoever is agitating for Biafra shows the level of his madness, but everybody is mad, the difference is the level of your madness,” he said.

Mourinho reveals why Tottenham threw away three-goal lead to draw 3-3 with West Ham Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said his side’s inability to deal with set-pieces cost them three points against West Ham. Spurs raced into a three-goal lead in the opening 20 minutes of their Premier League clash on Sunday. Harry Kane scored twice and provided an assist for Heung-Min Son. However, even with the introduction of Gareth Bale, Tottenham failed to extend their hand. Fabian Balbuena, a Davinson Sanchez own goal and a stunner from Manuel Lanzini ensured the Hammers drew 3-3. Mourinho told Sky Sports: “Of course I have to analyse the second half and have to do it internally, but for you I prefer to say football happened, and praise West Ham’s belief. “It is not easy to be losing 3-0 and be dominated, to keep the belief. I knew they are a different team to last season, but to lose an advantage of three goals is a big punishment and eventually deserved. “I found already by analysing from touchline, some things are completely out of the context, once more an indirect free-kick, the own goal, the third is a free-kick and second ball, a rebound. “The game was under control, we had Harry Kane to score the fourth when he hit the post, Gareth Bale to kill the game. The game was more to the fourth goal, but that’s football.”

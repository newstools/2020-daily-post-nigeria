A former Barcelona forward, Gerard Deulofeu, has said that captain, Lionel Messi is not the best player in football history. Deulofeu, who now plays for Udinese on loan from Watford, believes Barcelona legend, Ronaldinho, deserves the title ahead of Messi. “For me, Ronaldinho is the best player in history,” Deulofeu told the official Serie A website. “I met him, I went to see a match at the Camp Nou, and he was sitting next to me. It was a wonderful experience. “Messi is incredible too. I like him very much. I played with him for six months, and he is a nice person, a great player. “The whole world knows about Messi.”

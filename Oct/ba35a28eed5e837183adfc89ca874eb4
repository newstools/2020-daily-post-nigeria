Using the hashtag, #PCOSWithMedplus, Nigeria’s leading health and beauty retail pharmaceutical chain, Medplus Pharmacy reached out to audiences to share their stories with PCOS and its relevant symptoms, from irregular periods, difficulty getting pregnant, weight gain, to excessive hair growth. Mrs. Joke Bakare, Medplus Founder and CEO, commented, “PCOS is a major condition that impacts several aspects of life for women, but yet, it tends to be under-recognized by women as they have no idea what their symptoms mean, and end up suffering in silence until they have difficulty getting pregnant or until they develop other complications from having PCOS. As a pharmacy that deeply cares about our community and the wellbeing of Nigerian women, we found it vital to spread awareness of PCOS to encourage women to speak up about their symptoms, share their stories, and find a community with Medplus where they can always get support.” Here are 4 stories from the campaign that shows the importance of health awareness campaigns and creating safe spaces for people to share their stories and gain knowledge. *Note: Names have been made anonymous upon request* 1.

The Boyfriend That Learns
A man shared a message, “After reading the stories, I think my woman also has PCOS. Periods are very irregular.

The Woman Who Wants To Support Other “Cysters”
She shared, “I want to share my story to encourage other ‘cysters’.I was diagnosed of PCOS last year when I went to the gynecologist for a normal medical checkup. While growing up, I was the only girl out of 7 girls that saw her period very late, and afterward, I noticed it wasn’t frequent, as bad as seeing it twice a year. It’s been so bothersome really, aside from that, I have a lot of acne because of the background PCOS, with facial hairs and hair in other parts of the body, which isn’t supposed to be as a lady. I spend a lot of money on wax, it’s been a terrible phase for me…” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-845146" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-4.png" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-4.png 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-4-300x300.png 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-4-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-4-150x150.png 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-4-80x80.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> 4. The Condition That Led To A Breakup
Another woman shared, “I was also diagnosed with PCOS. For 4 to 5 years, I didn’t see my period. One minute I’m the happiest person and the next minute I’m just so moody and sad for no reason. The doctor advised I get married on time, with the way he explained it, I felt I was never going to have a child, and had to even break up with my boyfriend.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-845147" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-5.png" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-5.png 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-5-300x300.png 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-5-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-5-150x150.png 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-5-80x80.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> 5. The 30-Day Period And Abortion Rumours
She commented, “Good evening, I have PCOS, I was diagnosed a couple of years back. Sometimes I bleed for 30+ days and they’re usually heavy and then I wouldn’t see my period for months, sometimes 6 months… I rarely go to people’s houses too, I can’t keep explaining why I menstruate for one month plus. I remember one incident, my host started telling people I did abortion.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-845148" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-6.png" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-6.png 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-6-300x300.png 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-6-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-6-150x150.png 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slide-6-80x80.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> Though PCOS Awareness Month is over, Medplus continues to encourage people to spread awareness, get tested, and reach out to someone to talk to.

A retiree, Dr (Mrs.) Nma Olebara has embarked on a three-day hunger strike to protest the unpaid eight-month pensions arrears by Senator Hope Uzodimma-led government of Imo State. Olebara said there was no genuine reason for her to continue having sumptuous meals when some of her colleagues were dying of starvation and inability to afford medication. In a statement made available to the media, Dr. Olebara disclosed that she chose to fast and starve after receiving calls from three pensioners begging for food last weekend. According to her, “the calls I received from three pensioners this weekend led to this hunger strike. One said, ‘Doc, please help me, no matter how little, so that I can soak garri in water and drink, if I die without getting my money, my blood will be on the head of whoever that is holding my money’. “The second one said, ‘I went to FMC and couldn’t buy the drugs prescribed for me worth N28,000’. “The third said ‘Nma, sorry to disturb you again, anyhow, please, I will send my grandchild, please some cups of rice so that I can eat something before taking my drugs’. The writer and inspirational speaker wondered how long these starving retirees will carry on with the hunger. She described the situation as unfortunate and height of insensitivity on the side of the government. She concluded, “how can I be eating when my colleagues are hungry and dying. How can I be sleeping when they cannot sleep? I am on a three-day hunger strike. May God come to our rescue. Please pray for Imo state pensioners”.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has been advised to start Marcus Rashford on the bench for their clash with Arsenal. According to Gunners legend, Rashford has proven to be more effective as an impact substitute. The England striker came off the bench to net a hat-trick, as United thrashed RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Wednesday night. Rashford has made it a habit of scoring late for United, with all but one of his goals this season coming in the final 20 minutes of matches. “Marcus Rashford is the perfect supersub and should start on the bench for Manchester United this weekend,” Merson told Daily Star. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer should use him more often like that because the stats show that’s where he can sometimes be most dangerous. “When he starts, he doesn’t really score bundles of goals and often finds it difficult. “Arsenal is going to be a tight game. If it’s 0-0 after 60 minutes and Rashford comes on just when defenders are getting tired, he could have a field day.”

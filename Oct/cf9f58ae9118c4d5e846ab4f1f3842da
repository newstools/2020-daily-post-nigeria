Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has reacted to a statement by President Muhammadu Buhari blaming past leaders for Nigeria’s present woes. Buhari, during his 60th Independence Anniversary speech, called out past leaders from 1999 to 2015, for having the impudence to criticize his government.  However, reacting via his Twitter handle on Friday, Atiku Abubakar said Obasanjo’s administration was a period of restoration for Nigeria. According to him, Nigeria paid off her entire debt between 1999 and 2007 and maintained a 6% GDP growth. His tweet read, “Between 1999 and 2007, Nigeria paid off her entire foreign debt while maintaining an unprecedented 6% annual GDP growth. “Those were periods of national restoration, and I am very proud of the work President Obasanjo and I did for this nation we care so much for. Facts don’t lie.”

Some Nigerian football supporters have expressed disappointment over the National team’s performance against the Desert Foxes of Algeria in an international friendly which the Super Eagles lost 1-0 on Friday in Austria. The match served as a warm up game for both teams as they prepare for next year’s AFCON qualifiers. Ramy Bensebaini netted the only goal of the encounter in the 6th minute. After the match, fans took to their Twitter accounts to share their thoughts about the game. A sport journalist with the BBC, Debola Adebanjo, said, “Algeria’s organization cannot go unnoticed, better shape of the ball and understood how Nigeria wanted to play through the wings and blocked them everytime; ruining Nigeria’s rhythm at every opportunity. Algeria are the team to beat.” Another supporter, Peter Nwosu, said, “Eagles definitely deserved to lose, maybe even by more goal margins. In Maduka Okoye, though, it does seem like we might have found ourselves a good goalkeeper.” On his part, James Iloba said, “Watching the Nigerian team play was like watching some high school boys hurriedly put together to play a set. “Pass back all the time and not an iota of excitement, they did not play like a Nigerian team today.” May Johnson said, “If we had the chance to ask Super Eagles players individually if the game plan was to break down the Algerian defense then you would understand where the problem is. “There was no actual tactical plan to break down the defense. For me, Rohr is to blame.” Nigeria will also take on Tunisia in their second friendly game on Tuesday at the same venue in Austria.

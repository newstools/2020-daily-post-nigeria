The once peaceful End SARS protesters have set a tanker loaded with diesel ablaze for allegedly crushing a teenager to death near the Effurun roundabout in Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State. The deceased who is about 13 years of age is simply identified as Oghenevwegba, DAILY POST reports. Seeing the remains of the deceased on the ground, the End SARS protesters set the tanker ablaze as the driver ran to safety. Hoodlums took advantage of the process as they looted the Delta Shopping Mall (Shoprite) and other business centres in the areas. It took the swift intervention of soldiers from the Nigerian Army 3 Battalion to bring the situation under control. One of the conveners of the protest, Comrade Israel Joe, in a chat with DAILY POST said the protesters set the tanker ablaze in expression of anger over the death of the young boy. He noted that hoodlums hijacked the protest in the process. Joe said the protest has been temporarily suspended to avert any crisis in the area. Joe also urged the people of Delta State, particularly the youths to obey the 48-hour curfew imposed by Governor Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa to stem violence as street urchins have hijacked the protest.

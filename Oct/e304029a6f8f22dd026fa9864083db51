Right in front of the government house with the government owned bus! God is watching. We move aggressively.” Lagos State had been tagged as the epicentre for the protest against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, and police brutality in general. Despite the peaceful protest, some armed thugs had attacked protesters in Alausa area of Lagos State. Alausa is where the seat of power is located in Lagos State.

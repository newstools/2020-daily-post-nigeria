Aftermath of the End SARS protest, which later turned violent where some police stations and formations were attacked with arms carted away, the Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has granted a grace of seven days within which all those with illegal arms and ammunition in their possession in the state must turn them in. According to Akeredolu, the seven days period of grace commences from today, Friday October 30, 2020. Governor Akeredolu specifically directed that all such arms and ammunition should be returned to the Commandant of the South West Security Network, otherwise known as Amotekun at the Pa Fasoranti’s Gardens, Alagbaka, Akure, the state capital. The governor, who spoke through the State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, Donald Ojogo, emphasized that those in the category of illegal arms and ammunition bearers are to take advantage of the window of grace to turn in the deadly weapons as security agencies shall take necessary steps against defiance after the seven days period. “Those who find it difficult to physically present such arms and ammunition for obvious reasons are advised and indeed, encouraged to call 08079999989 for further advice and instructions on appropriate steps to be taken.”

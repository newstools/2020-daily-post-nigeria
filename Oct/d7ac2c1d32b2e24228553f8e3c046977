A former Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, on Saturday said the Nigerian government should provide an enabling environment for the Anti-Special Robbery Squad, SARS, protesters across the country. Atiku said the Nigerian government should provide a non-toxic environment for youths to protest. He made the call while declaring his support for the ongoing anti-SARS protest nationwide. In a series of tweets, the former Vice President, said a new policy that would enthrone the interest of Nigerians should be considered by the government. Atiku tweeted: “Nigerians should be provided with a non-toxic environment for #EndSARSProtests. It is their constitutional right and an ingredient of democracy. “They deserve to be heard and not killed or maimed. “I stand with you all as you peacefully protest to #EndPoliceBrutality and enthrone a new policing order that underscores interest of the citizens.”

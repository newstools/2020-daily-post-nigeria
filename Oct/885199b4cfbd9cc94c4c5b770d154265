Arsene Wenger has spoken of his admiration at Mikel Arteta’s stamp of authority on the Arsenal team. Arteta took over the Gunners in December 2019, after Unai Emery was sacked. Emery himself had replaced Wenger in the summer of 2018. When Arteta arrived, Arsenal was languishing below mid-table, with noises of discontent within the squad. But the 38-year-old, who spent five years as a player under Wenger, has worked wonders to restore the club’s identity as well as creating a sense of positivity and momentum that convinced captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to sign a new contract last month. Arteta has already added the FA Cup and the Community Shield to the trophy cabinet at the Emirates. Wenger has been impressed by the Spaniard’s start but hopes to see an improvement in the club’s Premier League form after they finished eighth last season. “[Arteta] got the grip back on the team. They finished well, though they had a bad Premier League. Fifty-six points!” Wenger noted in an interview with The UK Times.

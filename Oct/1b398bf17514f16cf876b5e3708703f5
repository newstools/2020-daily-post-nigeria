With two days to the governorship election in Ondo State, the Federal Government has released fresh guidelines for the conduct of the poll in the state on Saturday. Sani Aliyu, the National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, said no face masks, no voting. According to him, votes will commence at 8 am and close at 2 pm, but anybody in the outer queue will still be allowed to vote. Aliyu disclosed this during a briefing in Abuja on Thursday. He said: “On Saturday, Ondo State will hold governorship elections across 18 local government areas. We are expecting about 1.5million eligible people to cast their votes across 3,000 polling units in the state. “So this is clearly a huge exercise. It is a huge exercise that would also come with risks. “Therefore, in order to protect the voters, election officials and candidates in the electoral process, we urged everyone to strictly comply with the INEC guidelines that we have worked with INEC to set up with regards to the election. “For clarity, face masks are mandatory, so no face masks, no voting. Physical distancing must be enforced, especially in the queue areas of the polling units. “Alcohol-based hand sanitizers will be provided. Votes will commence at 8 am and close at 2 pm, but anybody in the outer queue will still be allowed to vote.”

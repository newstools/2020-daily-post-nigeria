Less than two weeks after its inauguration by Governor Dapo Abiodun, the Ogun Judicial Panel of Investigation has received no fewer than 20 petitions. DAILY POST reports that the panel was set up by Gov Abiodun to investigate complaints and petitions of victims of police brutality and abuse of human rights by security operatives in Ogun State. This was part of the demands of the End SARS protesters as they sought justice for individuals who were victims of police brutality and extrajudicial killings. Speaking after a meeting with members of the panel on Friday, the Chairman, Hon. Justice Solomon Olugbemi (Rtd), said “we have received 20 petitions already and sitting starts immediately.” According to him, the sittings of the panel would be transparent and open, saying media stations are invited to cover same. Olugbemi disclosed that the maiden sitting of the panel would hold on November 5. He added that the panel would be sitting on Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays, by 10am at the Magistrate Court 1, Isabo, Abeokuta. A statement by the media officer of the panel, Femi Osipitan, called on members of the public, who may have complaints to send in their petitions to the Secretary of the Panel or send an email to endsarsjudicialpanel@ogunstate.gov.ng. “Justice will surely be delivered,” the statement read.

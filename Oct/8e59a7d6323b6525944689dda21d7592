Hollywood celebrities, John legend and his wife, Chrissy Teigen have lost their newborn child after complications. Recall that Chrisy had been admitted in the hospital days ago after she had bleeding. She was admitted at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Sunday after revealing that she had been on bed rest and bleeding for “a little less than a month.” However, on Wednesday night Chrissy took to her Instagram page revealing that her newborn son died despite attempts to save him. Her post read: “We are shocked and in the kind of deep pain you only hear about, the kind of pain we’ve never felt before “We were never able to stop the bleeding and give our baby the fluids he needed, despite bags and bags of blood transfusions, it just wasn’t enough.” Teigen revealed that they waited to name the baby until after delivering like their first two pregnancies, but this time they had already begun calling “the little guy in my belly” Jack. “He will always be Jack to us,Jack worked so hard to be a part of our little family, and he will be, forever. “But everyday cannot be full of sunshine, on this darkest of days, we will grieve, we will cry our eyes out but we will hug and love each other harder and get through it,” her post added. The couple had their two children, Luna and Miles, through in vitro fertilization (IVF). But this pregnancy happened naturally, something Teigen said she didn’t think was possible for her.

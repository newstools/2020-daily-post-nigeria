Two key Super Eagles stars have left the team’s camp ahead of their friendly clash with Tunisia on Tuesday night in Austria. The players are William Troost-Ekong and Samuel Kalu. This was revealed by the Super Eagles’ media officer, Toyin Ibitoye. Troost-Ekong and Kalu were in action for the Super Eagles’ friendly 1-0 defeat to Algeria last Friday. ”Kalu was allowed to leave the camp and return to his club because of the knock he got in the game against Algeria,” Ibitoye told Brila FM. “For Troost-Ekong, he was permitted to go because he just joined a new club, and they’ve a game on Friday, so they want him to train with his team ahead of the game. “So with these two players out, we’ll have the chance to see new players for the game.” The kick-off time for the Nigeria vs Tunisia match is 7:30 pm.

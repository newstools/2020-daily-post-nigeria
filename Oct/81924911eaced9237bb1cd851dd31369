Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that Alex Telles will play no part when they face Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday. Telles tested positive for COVID-19 and is still in self-isolation. The defender arrived at Old Trafford this summer and has played in only one game for the Red Devils. “Telles won’t be ready. “Everyone else at the moment look as if they would be involved,” Solskjaer told a press conference on Friday. When asked about the availability of outcasts Sergio Romero and Phil Jones, he replied: “Sergio just returned to training this week and just started his pre-season work. “Phil has been injured, and he had an operation, and he is working really hard to get back. Hopefully, he will be fit by December.”

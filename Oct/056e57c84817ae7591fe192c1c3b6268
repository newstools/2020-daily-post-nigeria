The British Government has called on Nigerian authorities to respect the rights of End SARS protesters. The United Kingdom said this in reaction to several cases of assaults at protest locations. On the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), the UK observed the promise by the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on rights violations. Catriona Laing, British High Commissioner to Nigeria, gave her country’s position on Sunday. “We welcome the government’s announcement on the future of #SARS – an important first step. The IGP’s commitment to ensure accountability for human rights violations is essential to restoring public confidence in @PoliceNG “Hearing reports of violence affecting ongoing protests. Urge authorities to respect the right to protest and protestors to remain peaceful. @UKinNigeria.” Protests are continuing in different states amid reports of live bullets against demonstrators.

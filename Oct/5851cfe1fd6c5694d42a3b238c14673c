Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries, the Personal Assistant to President Mohammadu Buhari on New Media, Bahir Ahmad, and Popular Human rights activists, Deji Adeyanju, have reacted to the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS by the Inspector General of Police. DAILY POST recalls that following the nationwide protest against police brutality, Mohammed Adamu, the Inspector-General of Police, on Sunday ordered all officers and men of the now-defunct Special Anti-robbery Squad to be redeployed with immediate effect. Reacting to the development in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Sunday, Apostle Suleman insisted that Adamu’s order to disband SARS was not enough, adding that Nigerians want an executive order to effect it. Similarly, Ahmad hoped it would turn out to be the best decision for Nigeria. On his part, Adeyanju believes the dissolution of SARS is not yet over. Below is Suleman, Ahmad and Adeyanju tweets: @APOSTLESULEMAN, “IGP just announced SARS has been dissolved… that’s not enough..we want an executive order to that effect..” @BashirAhmaad, “SARS is now over, we hope it will turn out to be the best decision, for us, for our security and for the country. #EndSARS.” @adeyanjudeji, “It’s not yet over. #EndSARS.”

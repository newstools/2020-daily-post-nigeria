Former Ondo Governor, Segun Mimiko, has condemned the violence in the state ahead of Saturday’s governorship election. He observed that many people were scared to attend political rallies. The former minister lamented that at least five persons died in recent weeks during political violence. Mimiko is Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) national leader. NAN reports that the ex-governor spoke on Wednesday in Owo Local Government Area during a ZLP rally. Iroko, as fondly called, told the crowd to ask parties why their “members are using guns to pursue members of rival political parties.” He further berated the use of students’ shuttle buses for election campaigns. “Our party believes that government projects are for the benefit of the people. They should know that there is life after office.” ZLP candidate and Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, is contesting against Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Eyitayo Jegede, flagbearer of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP).

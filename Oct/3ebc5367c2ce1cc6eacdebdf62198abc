The Kwara State Police Commissioner, Mr. Kayode Egbetokun, on Tuesday, warned that he will deal decisively with any police officer that intimidates or harasses innocent citizens in the state. A statement by the state police command’s spokesman, Okasanmi Ajayi in Ilorin, also said “there is no Federal Special Anti- Robbery Squad, FSARS, in Kwara State.” In apparent reaction to the nationwide ban on activities of the FSARS, by the Inspector General of Police, the statement said “The SARS in Kwara State Command is fully and completely operating under strict supervision of the commissioner of police. “They don’t investigate cases and could only be seen on the street when responding to distress during emergencies, or while performing their core assignments against robbery and kidnapping,” it added. The statement said, the state police command, had earlier banned searching and checking of phones and harassment of innocent citizens by police officers in the command. It advised “public members to report any SARS operatives seen on patrol searching citizens phones indiscriminately to the commissioner of police through 08125275046 or 08032365122, as such officers will be deemed to be performing illegal duty.” DAILY POST recalls that two SARS operatives in the command were recently arrested for harassment and intimidation of two young men while coming from an emergency as captured in a viral video in Ilorin, the state capital.

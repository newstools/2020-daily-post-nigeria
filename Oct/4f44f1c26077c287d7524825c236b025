Rotational Chairmanship of Kano State Council of Emirs is put to halt, as Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje on Tuesday signed the State Emirates Council Amendment Law, 2020, making Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero the Emir of Kano as the permanent Chairman Council of Emirs. In what looks like intentional means to punish the dethroned Emir of Kano Muhammadu Sanusi II, the government then put an arrangement rotating the Chairmanship of the Council of Emirs across the newly-created Emirate Councils of Gaya, Rano, Karaye and Dambatta. But with the signing of the bill into Law, Aminu Ado Bayero was made the permanent Chairman of the Council, with Gidan Shettima as the Council secretariat, a stone thrown from the Kano Emir’s palace. The signing of the bill into law event took place during the State Executive Council meeting held at Africa House, Government House, Kano, Wednesday. “Before the signing of this Amended Law, we had 4 kingmakers from each of the five Emirates. But we now have 5 kingmakers from each of the 5 Emirates in the state, we did that to avert any unwanted situation in an event of appointing an Emir if need be,” Ganduje added. Explaining that, “to avoid contradiction of whatever sort, Kano Emir should, therefore, be a permanent Chairman of the State Council of Emirs.” Governor Ganduje further revealed that, very soon the Emir of Kano would be inaugurated as the Chairman of the State Council of Emirs, adding that, “the Secretariat, located at Gidan Shettima has since been renovated.”

The Premier League in England has agreed to a deal with domestic television broadcasters for matches outside of those in the normal broadcast slots to be shown via pay-per-view. Sky Sports and BT Sports have been broadcasting all Premier League games as part of their existing football packages so far this season. This is a provisional measure because of the exclusion of spectators in grounds due to the coronavirus pandemic. But under the new interim plan, those games outside of the normal slots for broadcast games, mostly in the Saturday 3pm local (1400 GMT) time slot, will now be available. However, this will be only for buying through pay-per-view platforms. “Under these new arrangements, the current live game selections will remain in place and will be broadcast as normal,” Premier League said in a statement on Friday. “In addition, the five matches per round not already selected will be made available to supporters on a pay-per-view basis, accessed via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Sports Box Office platforms.” It added: The agreement will be regularly reviewed in consultation with clubs and in line with any decisions made by the Government regarding the return of spectators to stadiums.” Amongst the matches likely to be on pay-per-view, according to the new formula, are Manchester United’s match at Newcastle United on Oct. 17. Liverpool’s home game against Sheffield United on Oct. 24 is also another one of them.

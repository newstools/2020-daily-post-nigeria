Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has become the first player to score in 16 straight Champions League campaigns. Messi was on target as they thrashed Ferencvaros 5-1 on Tuesday night. The 33-year-old converted from the penalty spot after being fouled in the area in the first half. Messi is only the second player to score in 16 Champions League seasons overall, along with Manchester Unitedâ€™s Ryan Giggs. Ansu Fati added a goal just before half-time, to give the LaLiga side a comfortable lead at Camp Nou. Fati made history of his own with the goal, becoming the first player to ever score more than once in the Champions League before his 18th birthday. There were further goals from Philippe Coutinho, Pedri and Ousmane Dembele after the break.

An activist, Aisha Yesufu, has confirmed that the police shot at her and other End SARS protesters in Abuja. There are footages on social media showing how operatives fired live bullets and teargas. On Sunday, Aisha tweeted about her experience during the rally. She accused President Muhammadu Buhari and his vice, Yemi Osinbajo, of giving a shooting order. “I still can’t believe I am neither dead nor in the hospital. Every step I took yesterday walking away as men of @PoliceNG shot at me, I braced myself for the moment of impact. “It seems President Buhari @MBuhari & @ProfOsinbajo gave IGP order to shoot at protesters. #EndSars.” On Saturday, a protester, Jimoh Isiaq, was killed in Ogbomoso by the police. The identity of the officer is unknown yet. Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has condemned the act. Makinde vowed to get justice for the family.

The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has confirmed that all players of the national team have tested negative to COVID-19, ahead of today’s friendly against Tunisia. NFF disclosed this via their verified Twitter page. “Ahead of tonight’s friendly game against Tunisia, all @NGSuperEagles players have tested negative to COVID-19,” the tweet reads. This comes days after two Tunisian players, Ferjani Sassi and Seifeddine Khaoui, tested positive for Coronavirus ahead of the game. The tests were carried out after their match against Sudan last Friday. This certainly means the duo will not be available for selection on Tuesday. The Super Eagles take on the Carthage Eagles by 7.30pm West African time.

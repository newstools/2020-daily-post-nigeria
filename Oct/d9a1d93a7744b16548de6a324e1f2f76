Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said Manchester United will be bringing in “one of the top strikers in the world” if they close a deal for Edinson Cavani. Cavani is believed to have arrived in Manchester on Sunday to undergo his medicals. The 33-year-old Uruguyan who is a free agent, will sign a two-year deal with United to bolster their attack. United lost 6-1 to Spurs on Sunday and when Mourinho was asked if he felt sympathy for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, he argued that his successor can have no complains. “It is not as if he arrived here and met a bad squad. And the team is improving. “They bought very good players. “If it is true that Cavani is coming, Cavani is one of the top strikers in the world. “And Manchester United is Manchester United. It is not this defeat that is going to destroy them,” Mourinho told a Zoom press conference on Sunday.

Real Madrid has been handed a significant injury boost ahead of their La Liga El Clasico clash with Barcelona on Saturday. Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, confirmed that captain Sergio Ramos is set to return from injury when they tackle Barcelona at Camp Nou. Recall that Ramos went off at half-time in Real Madrid’s 1-0 La Liga defeat against Cadiz last weekend. The centre-back was also absent as Zidane’s men were defeated 3-2 against Shakhtar Donetsk in the Champions League on Wednesday. “He’s our captain, our leader,” Zidane told a news conference on Friday. “He’s over his injury, but obviously we won’t take any risks. “He will be with us, you need players who are 100% fit, and Sergio is.” The kick-off time for the match is 3 pm, Nigerian time.

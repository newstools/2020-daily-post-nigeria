Leading smart accessory maker, Oraimo has succeeded in creating a wide range of high quality products that are trusted by majority of consumers nationwide. However, this achievement doesn’t come close to their triumph in adding quality to a global culture – the consumption of audio contents. Consuming audio content is a culture among Millennials and the older generation alike. Audio contents are one of the most consumed form of contents in the world. We listen to them almost all the time. Many young folks have songs blaring in their ears as they read articles online. This means that even when we consume other non-audio contents, we often supplement with audio. I wouldn’t be surprised if you’re doing the same right now.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-846472" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201007-WA0103.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="813" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201007-WA0103.jpg 828w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201007-WA0103-300x295.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201007-WA0103-80x80.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px"> A 2020 research by Statista; a data brewing agency, revealed that the rate at which people listen to podcasts has tripled within the previous decade.

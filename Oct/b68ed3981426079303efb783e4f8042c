The house of former Senate Leader, Victor Ndoma Egba, in Calabar Municipal Local Government Area of Cross River State, has been set on fire by some people suspected to be hoodlums. The multi-million naira building was also looted by some people suspected to be hoodlums some hours behind, who later ignited part of the building with fire, destroying a section of it. Vehicles and other valuables were not spared as at the time of filing this report, fire was still burning while hoodlums had earlier vandalized the property and carted away valuable items. An eyewitness said “After breaking into the house of the former Senate Leader Senator Victor Ndoma Egba in Calabar Municipal local government area in Cross River State, they set the place ablaze even after some people pleaded that putting fire in the building was not safe. “Some people were against setting the place ablaze, noting that it was because the compound was close to another compound hence, injury to one could be injury to all.”

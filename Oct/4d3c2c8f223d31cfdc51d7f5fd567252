The Lagos State Government has made it clear that the 24-hour curfew imposed from Tuesday is “indefinite”. This was confirmed by Gboyega Akosile, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Writing on his Twitter page, Akosile said Lagos will be on lockdown both day and night. “Curfew has taken effect in Lagos State. Lagosians are expected to stay off the streets except essential workers with proper means of identification. “Remember it’s a 24-hour curfew and not 24 hours. This simply means it’s not a day curfew. It is indefinite! “In other words, a 24-hour curfew is locked down during the day and night.” Sanwo-Olu announced the curfew earlier on Tuesday amid violent scenes from the #EndSARS protests around the state and it has since taken effect from 4 pm.

An Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Friday ordered that a 22-year-old, Ekene Jonathan, who allegedly defiled a minor, be remanded in Ikoyi Custodial Centre, pending legal advice. The police charged Jonathan with defilement. Chief Magistrate O.G. Ogrey ordered the police to return the case file to the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for legal advice. Ogrey adjourned the matter until Nov. 18 for DPP advice. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Kehinde Olatunde told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Sept. 22, at Ikota Housing Estate, Ajah. He alleged that the defendant locked up the 11-year-old girl and defiled her in his room. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State.

Florence Ita Giwa has appealed to Nigerian youths to forgive politicians. She made the plea in response to the violence and looting in her state, Cross River, and across the country. In a footage, Ita-Giwa, fondly called Mama Bakassi, admitted the failure of leaders and the older generation. “I am sorry for all the hurt the government has caused us. The ‘big people’ have failed and this generation has suffered enough. Please, stop the looting and burning”, she said amid tears. Ita-Giwa, 74, represented Cross River South Senatorial District in the Senate. She served as President Olusegun Obasanjo’s Special Adviser on National Assembly.

Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has taken full responsibility for their 3-2 defeat in the Champions League. Los Blancos began their campaign this season with a home loss to Shakhtar Donetsk. Zidane described it as “a bad game, a bad night” and vowed to “find the solution” ahead of their LaLiga clash against Barcelona on Saturday. Madrid trailed 3-0 at the Alfredo di Stefano stadium, before Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior pulled back two goals the second half. The result means Zidane’s team have lost twice at home in four days, after being beaten 1-0 by newly-promoted Cadiz. “We made a mistake with the first goal, and then we lacked confidence. It’s just as well my players reacted in the second half. It’s a bad game, a bad night. I’m the coach, I have to find the solution, I didn’t find it tonight.” “We know the situation we’re in. It’s our second bad game. Now we have to prepare our next game. It’s clear that I’m responsible,” Zidane told reporters after the ame.

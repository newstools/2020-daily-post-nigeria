Manchester United on Monday night confirmed the arrival of Edinson Cavani. Cavani arrives as a free agent, having left Champions League finalists Paris Saint-Germain this summer. The 33-year-old has signed a one-year contract with an option for a further year. He will earn around 210,000 per week after tax. Cavani will wear the number 7 shirt for United, which was rumoured to be reserved for Jadon Sancho. It was previously won by great names like David Beckham, Cristiano Ronaldo, George Best and Eric Cantona. United’s top target this summer was Sancho, but they have been unable to agree a fee. It has led the Red Devils to explore alternative options with a forward high on Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s shopping list. Names such as Ousmane Dembele, Lucas Ocampos and Luka Jovic were touted, but Cavani is the player that eventually arrived.

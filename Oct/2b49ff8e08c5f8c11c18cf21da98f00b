A retired military officer, Bode George, has revealed that a former Governor of Lagos State has three jets. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain did not mention a name. In an interview with Arise TV, he stressed that greed was a major problem in Nigeria. The politician warned that if leaders and officials fail to act right, youths may descend on their graves after death. “Look at the former Governor of Lagos State, he has three executive jets, private jets. The other one, 900X, can fly from Lagos to New York. Where is his business? “Look at the Falomo Shopping Mall that was built by Brigadier Mobolaji Johnson; you know what they have there now? The horse cable for Bola Tinubu’s son. What kind of madness is that? These are our heritage. “Look at the end of Awolowo road there, the nursing home. We can’t even train nurses anymore in Lagos State. These are issues, I am talking as an elder statesman. “I am in my mid-seventies, what am I afraid of if I can’t say it? If things go well, fine; if things don’t go well, our children – these same youths – will come and exhume our bodies and be mad with us. “Today, every day, we keep talking about Papa Awolowo, Herbert MacCaulay, talking about our heroes’ past because of their contributions. The greed is too much”, the ex-Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Chairman declared.

The National Economic Council (NEC) has ordered the establishment of judicial panels to probe Police brutality and killings. Laolu Akande, a presidential spokesman, on Thursday said this was the outcome of a meeting attended by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and governors NEC assured that victims of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and other units will get justice. The panels to be constituted in all states will have representatives of youths, students, civil society organisations. Each will be headed by a retired judge. NEC directed governors to establish a State-based Special Security and Human Rights Committee. They are to chair the committee which will supervise the new Police Tactical Units and all other security agencies in their state. The idea is to ensure that Police formations and other security agencies consistently protect human rights. “Members of the Special Committee would also include Representatives of Youths, and Civil Society. The head of Police tactical units in each of the State would also be a member of the Committee.” Governors have also been asked to immediately establish a victims fund to enable the payment of monetary compensation to deserving victims.

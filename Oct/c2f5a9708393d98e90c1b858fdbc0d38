The Federal Government and Organised Labour will resume negotiations over the hike in the price of fuel and electricity tariff. Representatives of both the federal government and organised labour will meet at 7 pm on Sunday. This was disclosed by the Deputy Director, Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Charles Akpan. “The Honorable Minister and Labour is meeting today by 7 pm,” Akpan told Nation. The Nigerian government had recently announced a new pump price of petrol and electricity tariff. However, the organised labour had threatened to embark on strike, an action that led to the suspension of the hike by two weeks.

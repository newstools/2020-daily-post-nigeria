In Akure, the Ondo State capital, aside the vehicles deployed for election duty, taxis, private vehicles as well as commercial motorcycles, popularly known as ‘Okada’ were seen moving about. Recall that the Inspector General of Police, Muhammed Adamu had ordered the restriction of vehicular movement from 12 am to 6 pm on Saturday. DAILY POST gathered that from Oba-Ile axis of Akure North Local Government to the popular Oba-Adesida part of Akure South Local Government the order is not being obeyed. Meanwhile, within the Akure metropolis, as at press time, there is no much presence of security operatives roving through the roads.  Electorates in Ondo State will today, Saturday, October 10, 2020, go to polling centres across the 18 local government areas in the state to elect their governor for the next four years. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had in August published the names of 17 governorship candidates and their running mates with their political parties for today’s poll. However, political observers believe that battle over who emerges governor of the state is clearly between incumbent Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress, APC; candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Eyitayo Jegede, and Agboola Ajayi, candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, ZLP. Mr. Ajayi, a former member of the ruling APC and incumbent Deputy Governor, is battling for the state’s number one position with his boss, Governor Akeredolu. There have been reports of violence and killings with continued clashes between supporters of the APC and PDP, being the two leading political parties ahead of today’s election.

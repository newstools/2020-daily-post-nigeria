The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said that his government has set up a N200million trust fund to compensate victims of police brutality in the state. Sanwo-Olu stated this in a tweet via his Twitter account on Thursday. DAILY POST recalls that this is coming after some hoodlums on Thursday attacked protesters who have been demanding an end to police brutality in Lagos State. “Compensation for victims of police brutality: No amount of money can make up for their experiences, but in Lagos, we have set up a N200m trust fund that will be managed by the panel set up to compensate victims of police brutality. “Actions against officers involved in brutalising protesters: The Lagos CP has arrested the officers involved in brutalising protesters at the Surulere protest venue and an orderly room trial has begun. “Even as we affirm the constitutional rights of all protesters to peacefully make your grievances known, it is also our duty as a government to ensure that the exercise of a set of rights by one group of people does not in any way constrain the rights of any other group of people. “I want to call on the youth and other groups protesting across the state to receive our outstretched arms, sheath your powerful swords and give us a chance at the Federal and State level, to consolidate on these actions being promptly taken to address your concerns,” he tweeted.

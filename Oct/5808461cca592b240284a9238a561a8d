The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu has said that hoodlums who made away with items meant for corps members would be arrested and made to face the law. Adamu said this on Friday after inspecting the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camp in Kubwa, Abuja, NAN reports. “It is very unfortunate that the camp was looted as we went round to see the destruction made by the hoodlums. ”The camp meant for the training of youths to enable them contribute to the development of the country has turned out to be the focus of looters. “However, it is a good thing that corps members were not in camp during the unfortunate incident because it would have been a disaster,” he said. He also revealed that some of the items have been recovered, while some of the hoodlums have been arrested. “A total number of 53 suspects have been arrested so far and would be charged to court. “I urge Nigerians to report anyone suspected to be in possession of the looted items to the nearest law enforcement agency. “For those hoodlums who broke into this facility and stole, we will ensure that we track them and prosecute them,” Adamu added.

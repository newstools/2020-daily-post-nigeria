A public commentator, Shehu Sani, has lambasted Northern Governors over their support for SARS. The former Senator condemned their declaration of support for the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The government critic tweeted his reaction on Friday. “Dear Northern Governors, if SARS is working in the North, why has kidnappings and killings by bandits and terrorists continued unabated? ”#EndsSARS”, Sani wrote. Plateau State Governor, Simon Lalong, spoke on Thursday after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja. The Chairman, Northern Governors Forum, said though the government has approved the scrapping of the unit, the decision should be reconsidered. “Some people said they don’t want SARS, some said they want SARS but a reformed SARS…Let us not just say we are throwing away the baby with bath water. If there are good ones, you don’t chase them away”, Lalong said.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-849043" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201016_104939.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="874" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201016_104939.jpg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201016_104939-300x243.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201016_104939-1024x829.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px">

The Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre, Sam Adeyemi has lent his voice to the #EndSARS campaign seeking an end to the operations of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS). The #EndSARS campaign started a few days ago on social media following complaints of harassment of Nigerians. Following this outcry, the IGP earlier on Sunday banned the Federal SARS from stop and search on Nigerian roads. Reacting, Sam Adeyemi, writing on his Twitter page, said the #EndSARS campaign would continue until the system changed and restructuring took place. The clergyman wrote: “The #EndSARS campaign continues, till the value system driving the treatment of citizens with indignity by police units and public officials changes. “Public officials must use power to serve citizens, not to intimidate and exploit them. This is one restructuring we really need.”

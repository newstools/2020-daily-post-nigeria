Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, was left furious after his side was not awarded a penalty, after Manchester United defender, Harry Maguire pulled down Cesar Azpilicueta during a corner kick in Saturday’s 0-0 draw. Maguire bear-hugged the Spaniard in the 40th minute and although the Blues called for a penalty, neither the referee nor VAR decided to award a spot kick. After the game, Lampard said he did not know why VAR was not consulted. “Yeah, holding is allowed, but headlocks don’t go on,” he told BBC Match of the Day. “I don’t know why VAR didn’t take long and there’s also a monitor to look at. I think if the referee goes to the monitor he gives a penalty. The result leaves Chelsea in sixth place with nine points.

Dr Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has drummed support for Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala’s appointment as the Director General of the World Trade Organisation, WTO. Ikpeazu said that Okonjo-Iweala’s victory will be a huge win for Women and Trade. He made the assertion in a tweet on his official Twitter page. “The victory of @NOIweala will be a huge win for Women, Trade (a pillar of our Government), Africa & the World. “As one eminently qualified for the position of Director General of @wto, we expect all 164 members to support her, including the great United States of America,” he tweeted. Meanwhile, although the organisation had decided that Okonjo-Iweala should be the next DG after she secured wide cross-regional backing, the United States of America on Wednesday rejected the appointment. Office of the US Trade Representative, in a statement, said the organisation “must be led by someone with real, hands-on experience in the field”. But, the Former Minister of Finance, in a tweet on Wednesday, said she was humbled to be declared the candidate with the largest votes amongst the 164 member states of the organization.

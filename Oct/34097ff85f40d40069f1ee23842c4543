Paris Saint-Germain manager, Thomas Tuchel, has described their 2-1 defeat to Manchester United, as one of their worst games ever. Bruno Fernandes gave the Red Devils the lead in the 23rd minute from the penalty. The Ligue 1 champions were level thanks to Anthony Martial’s goal 10 minutes into the second half. However, Marcus Rashford struck the winner late in the game, to ensure United took all three points. “In the first half, we were simply not on the pitch. It was not our level. “I don’t know why, but I can just say that it was not our level, in moving the ball, in possession, in counter-attacking, in challenges, in intensity. “By far, one of our worst games, one of our worst first halves,” Tuchel told beIN SPORTS

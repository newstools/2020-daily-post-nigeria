Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries, on Saturday, called for the proscription of Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS. Suleman explained that SARS was a disgrace to the Nigeria Police Force, NPF, hence should be proscribed. In a tweet, the clergyman stressed that some SARS operatives are worse than criminals. According to the fiery preacher, so many families have been rendered childless due to some trigger happy SARS operatives. Suleman, however, declared that operatives responsible for killing innocent Nigerians would “reap what they sow.” He tweeted: “SARS should be proscribed, they are a disgrace to the police force. They are worse than the ‘criminals’ they claim to be against..their trigger-happy nature have rendered mothers childless,sent youths on premature extinction,wasted destinies. They will reap what they sow.” This is coming at a time when some SARS operatives reportedly killed a man in front of Wetland Hotel, Ughelli in Delta State.

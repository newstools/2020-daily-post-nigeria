An elder statesman, Buba Galadima, has made an explosive revelation about COVID-19 palliatives. He spoke on Monday during an interview aired on AIT. Allegations of hoarding had been made against some federating units. The former National Secretary of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) accused a state of diversion of food items meant for the masses. He narrated how persons sent by the government visited his office to look for buyers. Galadima alleged that the state also sponsored thugs to Abuja during the End SARS protest. “I know of a state, where all the palliatives taken from the federal government were kept in stores and they came to my office looking for buyers for those commodities and they said the buyers must not be from that state”, he said. On Monday, Nigeria Governors denied claims that they deliberately kept the palliatives and refused to share.

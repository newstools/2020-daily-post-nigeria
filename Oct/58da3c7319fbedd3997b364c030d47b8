The Deputy National Coordinator of the Buhari Campaign Organization blamed Buhari for taking things lightly with protesters. He pointed out that former President Olusegun Obasanjo would never have allowed such protest. According to Coomassie: “Can you try this nonsense during Obasanjo’s time? I blame Buhari for taking things lightly. “There are certain things that should be handled with an iron fist.” Video: Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, Deputy National Coordinator, Buhari Campaign Organization

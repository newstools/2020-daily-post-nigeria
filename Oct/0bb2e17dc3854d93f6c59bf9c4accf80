Some citizens who stormed a warehouse where COVID-19 palliatives were stored have donated some of the items taken to beggars. A viral video showing the gesture has attracted 240,000 views. At least, seven states in Nigeria have witnessed spontaneous raids on facilities that house palliatives. They include Anambra, Cross River, Edo, Kaduna, Kwara, Lagos and Plateau States. The first of such incident happened in Nigeria‚Äôs commercial city, Lagos. In its reaction, the government condemned the vandalization of the warehouse located at Mazamaza area of the metropolis. Abisola Olusanya, Agriculture Commissioner, recalled that the items donated by the Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) group were received by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on September 22. Noting that they were ‚Äúmeant for distribution to the indigent‚Äù, Olusanya said that Lagos was allowed to rebag those allotted to it from the quantities meant for South-West States. ‚ÄúThe rebagging was being done to account for each beneficiary receipt, as was required and monitored by the CACOVID team. The distribution was on-going but had to be halted due to protests‚Äù, he added. Some Nigerians have punctured the official‚Äôs explanation. They posited that other states in the region had received their allocation. How the information of the locations leaked remains a mystery but more storage sites are being discovered. Trending footage of youths giving out part of their share was reportedly recorded in Ilorin, the capital of Kwara State. May Almighty Allah continue to bless this set of "hoodlums". Nigeria will definitely be great again. #oyingbo #calabar #ItIsNotFinished #AfricanSocialStar #adesina #Coca-Cola #ilorin #Dj Switch #whatsapp #cross river state #karma #indomie #tung #lawma #AbujaTwitterCommumity pic.twitter.com/cW1465sutI ‚Äî GASIFY‚õΩÔ∏è #ENDSARS‚úäüèΩ (@Acedolapo) October 23, 2020

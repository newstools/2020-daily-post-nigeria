Newly-invited Nigerian goalkeeper, Sebastian Osigwe, has tested positive for COVID-19. His Swiss Super League club, Lugano, confirmed this on Friday. Osigwe was only handed his maiden Super Eagles call-up on Thursday, ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier double-header against Sierra Leone in November. He and another of his club team-mate, Mattia Bottani contracted the virus, while six other players have been quarantined. With eight players out of their next Super League fixture against Young Boys on November 1, Lugano has requested for the game to be postponed. It, however, remains to be seen if Osigwe will be available for Nigeria’s upcoming matches against Sierra Leone on November 13. The reverse fixture against the Leone Stars will take place in Freetown four days later. Osigwe was invited along with Maduka Okoye and returning Daniel Akpeyi, with Katsina United’s Ikechukwu Ezenwa on the standby list.

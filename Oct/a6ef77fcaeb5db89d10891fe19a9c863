Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he is not interested in playing mind games with his predecessor, Jose Mourinho. Earlier this week, Mourinho took a dig at United over the number of penalties they are awarded. When asked by reporters on Friday about Mourinho’s insinuation that United have been reliant on a high number of penalties, Solskjaer chose not to criticise the Tottenham Hotspur boss. “The rules are as they are in football, aren’t they? “It’s more for you and the media. I think it’s important that we have a bit of entertainment as well. “And Jose throughout the years has given us all some fantastic moments in football both in his press conferences and on the pitch. “But as a striker, I didn’t mind how big the box was, when I got in there it was just a strike on goal,” Solskjaer said.

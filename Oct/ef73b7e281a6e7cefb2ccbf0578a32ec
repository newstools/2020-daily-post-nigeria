President of the Senate Dr. Ahmed Ibrahim Lawan, is set to sponsor another wedding ceremony of 100 less privileged and orphaned couples in Nguru and Karasuwa local government areas of Yobe State. The latest mass wedding is the second in a series of sponsored weddings by the senate president. He had earlier in September supported the conduct of another 100 weddings in Bade and Jakusko local government areas. The beneficiaries of the wedding largesse are drawn from each of the political wards of Nguru and Karasuwa local government areas under the sponsor’s senatorial district. The initiative by the senate president was meant to assist to underprivileged intending couples who are of marriageable age but with nobody or means to finance their weddings. Under this arrangement, our correspondent learned that the senate president is to pay all dowries on behalf of the benefiting grooms while he equally takes care of their furniture and household requirements. The Chairman, wedding Organizing Committee and Yobe State Commissioner of Budget, Mohammed Gagiyo revealed that another set of 100 intending couples from Machina and Yusufari are next to benefit from the gesture in due course. The Senate President’s mass wedding intervention is targeting 300 less privileged young ladies with the dowries of their husbands across Yobe North Senatorial District.

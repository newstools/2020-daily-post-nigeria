The Young Progressives Party (YPP) candidate for the October 10 governorship election in Ondo State, Dotun Ojon, has denied withdrawing from the race. Ojon cleared the air during an interview on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Tuesday. According to him, the party is not for sale. When asked if he stepped down for a major political party, Ojon replied “That is not true. “YPP is not for sale and we are not ready to step down for anyone.” Ojon said that the speculation arose, after 10 political parties threw its weight behind another political party. He insisted that he did not know who signed on behalf of the YPP. “For us, it is a sign that YPP has become a force in Ondo State that everyone wants to identify with. When we started, nobody gave us a chance. Nobody knew we could come this far,” Ojon said.

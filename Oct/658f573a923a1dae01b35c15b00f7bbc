Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford has released a statement following the Red Devils’ Premier League 6-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. Rashford promised Man United fans that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men will do better going forward after losing at Old Trafford against Tottenham. The England international also apologized as Man United failed to beat Spurs at home. “First and foremost I’m a United fan. This is my club,” He said in a statement posted on his Twitter handle after the game. “I’m so proud to wear this shirt but there are no excuses, It’s just not good enough and to every single fan around the world that tuned in today, I’m just so sorry. “You deserve so much better than that. I would have stayed away from social media tonight but you deserve to hear from me during the highs and lows, there is no hiding. “I feel horrible but I promise you we will do better.”

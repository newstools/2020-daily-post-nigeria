President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday held a video conference with Mr Charles Michel, President of the European Council, during which the latter reiterated Europe’s support for Nigeria’s Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the next Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The President is leading Nigeria’s charge for Okonjo-Iweala, the country’s former Minister of Finance, to emerge as the first Black and female WTO DG. President Buhari thanked the European Council for its support for Nigeria’s candidate. Also discussed during the conference were issues bordering on debt relief for Africa, EU-African relations and recharge of Lake Chad, which has currently shrunk to less than one-third of its usual size. The lake has reportedly thrown about 130 million people who depend on it for their livelihoods into dire straits. Recharge of the Lake Chad basin is an issue the Nigerian President had vigorously canvassed for at different global fora in recent times. President Buhari expressed appreciation to Mr Michel for expected positive developments on the issues raised.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said that midfielder, Paul Pogba, has been ‘pestering’ him to take some of the Red Devils’ free kicks for some time now. Solskjaer said this while reacting to Pogba’s free kick goal against Brighton in the Carabao Cup fourth round tie on Wednesday night. He said the France World Cup winner has been training hard lately on his free-kicks and he has fine-tuned his touch. Man United defeated Brighton at the Amex Stadium, thanks to three goals from Scott McTominay, Juan Mata and Paul Pogba. “Paul has been working hard, and he has been pestering me to take some of the free-kicks, but of course we have had a few others in Bruno and Marcus,” Solskjaer was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying. “Paul has been training hard lately on his free-kicks, and yesterday I think he fine-tuned his touch.” Pogba will now hope to continue his brilliant display for Man United when they host Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford this weekend in the Premier League.

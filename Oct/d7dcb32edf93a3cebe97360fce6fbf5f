The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has warned that the ongoing End SARS protests may consume Nigeria. Adams said “there are signals” of a national crisis, and advised authorities to properly manage the situation. He condemned the use of live bullets against demonstrators by policemen. No fewer than 6 people have lost their lives since the protests began. In a statement on Tuesday, Adams told the Police that it is the right of Nigerian youths to express anger over extra-judicial activities of law enforcement agencies. “It is most disturbing seeing the number of casualties in the protests growing by the day. It is unfortunate that some bad eggs in the police have become utterly lawless, killing Nigerians raising their voices against SARS brutality. “Those youths protesting are of the digital age, they are the leaders of the future and they are entitled to express their voices and concerns against the state of the nation.” “In the history of our nation, it has never got to this level where the entire system is in comatose. It behoves on the Federal Government to listen to the cries of Nigerians over the spate of insecurity, hike in electricity tariff, increase in the prices of food commodities, and high cost of living. “Many of the youths protesting are students that left the universities years ago and are still unemployed. With their hopes bleak, they are frustrated with the government; they have lost confidence. “More importantly, I think we must restructure this country to regionalism, based on federating units or we exit through referendum peacefully without shedding of blood. Liberia, Rwanda, Congo and Somalia started like this before they were engulfed in war”, Adams warned.

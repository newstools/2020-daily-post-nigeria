Popular singer, Naira Marley, on Friday hinted on a revolution in Nigeria. Marley said the current protest against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, unit of the Nigeria Police Force may lead to a revolution. He stated this while commending youths for protesting. In a tweet, Naira Marley wrote: “This endsars shii can end in revolution.” Recall that Naira Marley had called for a protest against SARS. However, he backed down on his protest, following an intervention by the Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare. Dare had appealed to Naira Marley to shelve a planned SARS protest because the federal government was already addressing the issues affecting Nigerian youths. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847152" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201009_155546_899.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="357" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201009_155546_899.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201009_155546_899-300x149.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

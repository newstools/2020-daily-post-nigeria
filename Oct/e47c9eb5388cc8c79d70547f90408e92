A vigilante has killed an attendant of a Point of Sale, POS, shop in Adamawa State and stolen the cash balance of the day. The vigilante whose name is given as Nuhu Dauda, is identified as a 28-year-old regular customer at the POS shop located in New Badisa, a community in Girei Local Government Area. It was gathered Sunday morning that the suspect went to the shop on Saturday, strangled the female attendant, a 12-year-old secondary school student, and took all the money he could find. The suspect also took away the POS machine at the shop, but has since been arrested and now in police net. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Sulaiman Nguroje, said the suspect had been arrested and found to be a member of a vigilante group operating in the community. “The victim’s family members are helping the police with useful information for a wider investigation,” the PPRO said. The victim, Jemima Reuben, is said to be a student of First Baptist Academy, Yola, who was using the COVID-19 forced holiday to work at the POS shop but was said to be preparing to resume school on Monday, October 12 when all schools in Adamawa State are scheduled to reopen. Girei where this incident happened is a municipal Local Government Area which shares boundaries with Yola North LGA. Girei which is home to the Modibbo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH) and all the television broadcasting stations in Adamawa State, has a huge share of crimes. The office of the AIT, located in the same Badisa neighborhood, was burgled only some days back.

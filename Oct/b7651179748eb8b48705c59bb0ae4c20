Arsenal starlet, Bukayo Saka, has said he pledged his international allegiance to England, because he thinks “they are going to do great stuff” in the future. Saka, speaking with Sky Sports, however wished the Nigeria national team all the best. The versatile player has been handed call-up by Gareth Southgate for their upcoming matches against Wales, Belgium and Denmark. The 19-year-old’s international future has been a tussle between the Three Lions and the Super Eagles, ever since he broke into the first team at the Emirates. But Saka has now given reasons why he went with the country of his birth. “I feel like I’m really, really proud of my Nigerian heritage. “I always still watch Nigeria’s games where I can and I wish them all the best and support them all the way, but I’ve seen the process of how England are transforming and I think in the future they’re going to do great stuff. “I feel like it was right for me to choose England,” he said.

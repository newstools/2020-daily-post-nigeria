Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, was sent off as Napoli registered their first Europa League win of the season, thanks to a deflected Matteo Politano strike to beat Real Sociedad away from home. The Partenopei had lost their opening fixture 1-0 at home to AZ Alkmaar. Gennaro Gattuso chose to leave Osimhen on the bench for the game against the LaLiga side. Osimhen came on in the second half and had the ball in the net in the 86th minute, but the goal was disallowed. His night then got worse, after he was shown a yellow card for jumping with elbow raised on Le Normand. Both bookings were for na√Øve challenges he could have avoided and he will now be suspended for the next Europa League match.

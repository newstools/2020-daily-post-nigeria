The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) has said that three people died in a fatal accident at Lotto, opposite NNPC Filling Station on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, on Friday. TRACE also said that one person sustained injuries in the accident which involved two vehicles. The Mowe/Ibafo Area Commander of TRACE, Mr Olusola Ojuoro, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ota, Ogun, that the accident happened at about 8:45 am. Ojuoro explained that an Iveco truck with registration number AAB 458 ZY was inbound Lagos when it lost control due to brake failure and crushed a Mazda bus marked XY 660 EKY. He said: “The corpses of the victims have been deposited at Idera Hospital Morgue, Ogun, while the survivor was taken to an undisclosed hospital by his relative.” Ojuoro cautioned motorists and truck drivers against exceeding speed limits. The TRACE official urged them to ensure that their vehicles were in good condition before putting them on the road to avoid unnecessary loss of life. He also commiserated with the families of those that lost their lives and prayed to God to grant them the fortitude to bear the losses.

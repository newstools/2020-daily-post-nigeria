The Governor of Niger State, Abubakar Bello, has told President Muhammadu Buhari that the people in his state are living in hell, following the collapse of two bridges along the Minna-Bida road and Bida-Wushishi-Zugeru road. Bello met with Buhari at the Presidential Villa on Friday. Speaking to State House Correspondents afterwards, the Governor noted that the poor state of federal roads has made life difficult for commuters and is threatening to cut them off from the rest of the country. He also lamented that floods have destroyed acres of crops, particularly sugar plantations. According to Bello, “something needs to be done immediately to provide alternative routes” and he hopes to be able “to get some quick intervention from the Federal Government so that we can support our local farmers that have lost their livelihood due to floods.” Asked about the President’s response to his request, Bello said, “The President believes more in action, he doesn’t talk too much. I think from his countenance I can say that he felt bad especially for Niger State. We are shouldering all the weight, every cargo from South West passes through Minna specifically. “I think he has an idea, he probably will not know everything but he has an idea what we are going through at the moment. “At the moment we are going through hell in Niger State. So I believe something will be done.”

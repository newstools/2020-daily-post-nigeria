The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Sunday, accused President Muhammadu Buhari of using the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, unit of the Nigeria Police Force, NPF, against Nigerians. HURIWA, a prominent rights group, claimed that Buhari has been using SARS operatives to quell peaceful protesters since 2015. The group made the claim in response to the alleged killing of a young man in Ughelli, Delta State. This is even as the Minister of State for Labour and Productivity, Festus Keyamo denied the involvement of SARS operatives in the matter. Keyamo had also claimed that the young man was alive and hospitalized. Reacting to the controversy, a statement by the group’s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko reads partly: “HURIWA has located the blame for the rampant shootings and extralegal killings of citizens by armed Police operatives known as Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) on the desk of President Muhammadu Buhari for having a long history of impunity and crass misuse of the armed security forces to quell otherwise peaceful protests since 2015, thereby leading to the killing of dozens of Nigerians.”

Newcastle United legend, Alan Shearer, has predicted the position Manchester United will finish this season in the English Premier League, EPL. Man United finished third on the Premier League table last season behind Liverpool and Manchester City respectively. But Shearer expects Man United not to improve on the third position they finished last season, insisting that he doesn’t think the Red Devils can challenge for the Premier League title this term. According to him, Man United are “going backwards” under their manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this season. Shearer stated this ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Saturday. “I wasn’t expecting Manchester United to challenge for the title anyway,” Shearer told The Athletic. “I thought they would challenge for a top-four spot, but at the moment they look as if they are going backwards. “If you look at the three league games they have played, the first game against Crystal Palace they were hopeless. “The second game against Brighton, yes they showed some character to get back into the game, but they also got away with it because Brighton hit the woodwork five times. “The third game against Tottenham, you could use whatever word you wanted, and they could not argue with it because it was there for everyone to see. “And it was not as if it was just because they had a man sent off; it was a shambles with eleven men as well. It was really poor.”

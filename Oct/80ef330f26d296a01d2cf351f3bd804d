The commissioner further explained that “The swapping of Principals to curb examination malpractices, will continue in both BECE and the forthcoming NECO examinations. “Principals in public schools will be swapped to other schools to monitor and supervise examinations. “This will allow external invigilators to do their work effectively and efficiently,” she declared.

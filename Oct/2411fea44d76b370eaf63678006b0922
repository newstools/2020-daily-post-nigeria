The Akwa Ibom State Police Command on Wednesday said it has arrested one Udoh Okon of Mbiakpan Ikot Edim Village of Ibiono Ibom local government area of the state who absconded after bathing his wife with acid. Okon, Friday last week, reportedly poured acid on his wife, killing her, over a minor disagreement and fled to an unknown destination. It was gathered that his wife was rushed to an undisclosed hospital in Uyo, the state capital, by neighbours, where she died the following day (Saturday) from severe acid burns. Confirming the arrest on Wednesday the command’s Public Relations Officer Odiko Macdon in a statement said the man was arrested by the police with the assistance of the youths of the area and would soon be prosecuted.

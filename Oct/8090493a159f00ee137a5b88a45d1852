The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has debunked rumours that some members of the national team tested positive for COVID-19 in Austria, ahead of their international friendly match against Algeria on Friday. The NFF described such reports as “blatant falsehood” and urged fans to ignore the information. The federation, however, confirmed that results of the COVID-19 tests carried out on the Super Eagles players were still being awaited. “The writer of the story totally misrepresented what Rohr said, that since the outbreak of the pandemic, that four of our players had tested positive to COVID-19 but were all now fully recovered from the virus and back in action. “The results of the COVID 19 tests carried out on the Super Eagles ahead of tomorrow’s game are still being awaited,” the NFF tweeted. The game is billed to kick-off 7.30 pm Nigerian time.

The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Sunday cautioned the Mai Mala Buni, National Caretaker Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Yobe State Governor against sending impostors and charlatans to insult PDP state governors and other patriotic leaders just to divert attention from the failures and problems of his party. PDP advised Buni to design a more constructive way of containing the manifest failures of APC government at the federal and state levels instead of “this jealous act of seeking to use nonentities to attempt to drag down PDP performing governors and other well meaning Nigerians.” The party stated this in a statement signed by its National spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan entitled: “Stop insulting our Governors, PDP cautions Gov. Buni.” According to Ologbondiyan: “It is indisputable that governors elected on the platform of the PDP have performed and are performing better, by all standards, than their counterparts in the APC. “Nigerians across the country already know that the standard of living, infrastructural development, wealth creation, employment opportunities as well as growth in critical sectors including aviation, education, health, transportation power, energy, manufacturing, commerce are better in PDP states. “Of course, no APC governor can point to any development project that can compete with the achievements of any of our governors in any sector of life.”

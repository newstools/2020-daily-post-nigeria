One of the youths clamouring for the ban of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) , an arm of the Nigeria Police Force, has been shot in Ogbomoso town in Oyo State. DAILY POST gathered that irate youths on Saturday stormed major streets in the town to demand the proscription of SARS. Our correspondent learnt that the victim who was shot in the leg was shot when the protesters reached Owode Police station in Ogbomoso. It was gathered that the man was shot when the police men at the station were trying to ensure that the station was not being attacked by the angry protesters. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847421" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201010-WA0009-1.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="799" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201010-WA0009-1.jpg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201010-WA0009-1-300x222.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG-20201010-WA0009-1-1024x758.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> A source told DAILY POST that the protesters were later dispersed by the rain. He added that the victim has been rushed to an undisclosed hospital in the town. DAILY POST made an attempt to reach the Public Relations officer of the state Police Command, Mr. Olugbenga Fadeyi whose phone was busied. Efforts made by our correspondent to get the PRO proved to be abortive as at the time of filing this report on Saturday.

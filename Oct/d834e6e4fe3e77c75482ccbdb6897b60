Some police officers who participated in the last gubernatorial election in Ondo State have raised alarm over non-payment of their allowances. Recall that some Police officers were deployed from other states to contribute to the election peacekeeping process in Ondo. However, some of those who were deployed from Oyo State for the October 10th governorship election say they have not been paid their due allowances. The allegation is coming nineteen days after the election was held and won by Governor Akeredolu. The officers who preferred anonymity disclosed to journalists that they were yet to be paid their allowances after participating in the election. The officers said the Police Headquarters in Abuja had sent a signal that they would be paid before deployment but failed to make the payment till this present time. The officers said the non-payment of the election allowances affected police officers from Oyo State posted to Ese-Odo Local Government area of Ondo State for the exercise. The officers called on the police hierarchy to come to their aid and ensured that their election allowances are paid. “Some officers deployed to Owo Local Government have been paid. “No single officer deployed to Ese-Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State have been paid and we were about 300 deployed to that local government. “We are calling on the police authority to pay our allowances and let it not be promise and fail as usual”. However, the Public Relations Officer, Oyo State Command, Mr. Olugbenga Fadeyi, said it was not the Police Command in the state that was handling the payment but the Abuja Headquarters. Fadeyi urged the officers to channel their grievances to the appropriate authority. He said that non of the officers has complained to him and he did not have any details about payment of the allowance.

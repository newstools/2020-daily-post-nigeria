Ex-Big Brother Naija star, Vee, has revealed that fellow ex-housemate, Tolanibaj blocked her on social media. Vee, however, said she has no beef with Tolanibaj, adding that she may have a conversation with her if they happen to meet. The face-off between Vee and Tolanibaj started at some point in the lockdown house but many would thought they will forge on after the show. While Tolanibaj was evicted earlier in the show, Vee stayed till the final day. Responding to a question on the possibility of both of them reconciling, the London-born ex-housemate said, “I don’t have beef with Tolanibaj. Beef is a word when it is two-sided. “I didn’t block anybody. I did not follow anybody. I’m blocked. I’m B for blocked. But I’m not beefing anyone. I’ve to make that very clear. “I intend on being civil. If I see her and we have a conversation, we have a conversation. But one thing I don’t do is force things. If you don’t like me, you don’t like me.”

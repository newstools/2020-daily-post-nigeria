Lagos State Government has come under criticisms for embarking on a clean up of the Lekki area. Last Tuesday, soldiers opened fire on unarmed protesters at the toll gate. The incident attracted global outrage and calls for probe. World powers and international groups have demanded prosecution of those involved in the shooting. On Twitter Friday night, Gboyega Akosile, Press Secretary to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu announced a clean up exercise. The spokesman said waste management personnel were going round affected areas. “Today, @Lawma_gov started a clean up of the mess generated during the #EndSARS protests. The clean up exercise continues tomorrow until the entire city is rid of dirt. @IOdumboni and very hardworking @Lawma_gov workforce sighted today at Lekki toll gate”, he tweeted. Many respondents condemned the word “‘mess”, accusing the state of cover up. Others noted that the government was yet to provide an update on investigation of the shooting. They argue that forensic experts should have been deployed to some of the scenes, especially Lekki toll gate to collect things that could aid probe of the military attack. Some reactions below: @Ugoosings: Crime scene cleared up without investigation. I weep for this country. @MaryanneMoghalu: I suppose you have to do your job, but your choice of words is unfortunate. The lack of empathy is really quite unbecoming. @VetiNazreehlDr: At this point I do not know what to say again. I’m just heartbroken & I weep for us. The country is a mess and there’s no justice system but we’ll all wait for 2023 tho it seems far but I’m sure it’ll be worth the wait. @Jerry_emy: People died on a scene and it is yet to be investigated and you call it a mess. Posterity will never be kind to all the people who downplayed this killings @Obasanjoedeki: It is apparent the government (in its current form and thinking) does not understand that #Nigerians have lost all faith in its ability to discharge its responsibilities as enshrined within our constitution and moved on. @Ayemojubar: You people are cleaning up a crime scene before investigation even start? That place should be locked up for forensic audit and investigation. This is another proof that you people planned to obstruct justice by eliminating evidences. @DandyNaija: The military killed those people and carted their body away. Now the state government has come to wipe evidence from the crime scene without any forensic investigation. Lord, how did I land in this country? Please get me out of here! @E_Osanyin: The mess generated during the #EndSARS protest? By the way, this is a crime scene. Are the authorities done with their investigation? What of the CCTV footage? Anyone looked at it? Why the rush to cleanup a major crime scene? Why are things upside down in this country? @Ajanabijoux: #EndSARs protesters cleaned up after themselves every single day. They are decent human beings! How difficult can it be for you to call a spade a spade and lay the blame at the feet of the hoodlums that caused this?! @OluOmoSWP: Toll gate that should be closed down till investigation is over. But why will they investigate, when they know who and why whatever happened, happened. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-851503" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201024_121739.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1819" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201024_121739.jpg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201024_121739-178x300.jpg 178w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201024_121739-608x1024.jpg 608w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201024_121739-912x1536.jpg 912w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-851505" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201024_120501.jpg" alt="" width="810" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201024_120501.jpg 810w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201024_120501-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201024_120501-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px">

Jadon Sancho has been left out of Borussia Dortmund’s squad for their Bundesliga game against Freiburg, the UK Mirror reports. The England forward was also absent during their German Super Cup defeat against Bayern Munich on Wednesday. This comes as speculation continues to mount, over a late move to Manchester United with transfer deadline day fast approaching. Sancho is United’s top transfer target, but the move looked to be dead in the water up until recently. Dortmund had set the Red Devils an August deadline to complete the deal, but that date has since passed. The 20-year-old participated in the German club’s pre-season preparations, with club chief Michael Zorc regularly insisting the player would not be sold. Dortmund have also rejected United’s latest bid, but Sancho’s omission will again raise eyebrows and suggest a move could still be on the cards.

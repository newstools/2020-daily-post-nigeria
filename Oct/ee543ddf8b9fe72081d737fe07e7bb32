The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has condemned the attack on the End SARS protesters by hoodlums in the state on Friday. The pictures and videos from some of the protesters, which have been circulating online, showed some hoodlums armed with machetes and other dangerous weapons attacking protesters marching along Ring Road, killing one and injuring several others. Reacting, the Governor in a statement released on Friday evening, ordered the state Police Command to provide adequate security for the protesters as they exercise their rights as concerned Nigerians. According to him, a thorough investigation would commence immediately to bring the culprits to justice. “I just learnt that some hoodlums attacked End SARS protesters, who have conducted themselves peacefully in Benin City. “I extend my condolences to the victims of the attacks, including those who lost their lives and others who were seriously injured by these thugs. “It is very disheartening that anyone would want to attack a peaceful protest of young people who are genuinely expressing concerns over police brutality and intimidation in their own country. “I hereby call on the Edo State Police Command to get out on the streets and provide adequate security for the protesters. “I also urge them to ensure that no one is harassed in the course of exercising their rights,” the governor said.

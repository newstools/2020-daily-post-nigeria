A former House of Assembly member, Dayo Akinleye and four others have appeared before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrate Court for alleged involvement in the burning of properties in the State during the End Sars protest. Others include Afolabi Ariyo, James David, Ajimoko Busola and Oyin Filani. The Police Prosecutor, Mr Johnson Okunade told the court that the defendants committed the offence on Oct. 20 at Ado-Ekiti. He explained that the defendants also burnt three trucks conveying cement, saying that the value of the damages was yet unknown. Mr Okunade said that the offence was punishable Under Section 451 of the Criminal Code, Cap. C 16, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. Counsel to the defendants, Mr Kola Kolade prayed the Court to grant bail to the defendants, saying they were implicated. He also promised that the defendants would not jump bail and would always make themselves available in court. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Olanike Adegoke consequently granted bail to the defendants in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties each adding that each of the sureties must be a Civil Servant on grade level 12. She later adjourned the matter to Nov. 11 for further hearing.

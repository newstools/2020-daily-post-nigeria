Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has disclosed he was worried about right-back, Hector Bellerin because he thought the defender would leave the club this summer ahead of Monday’s transfer deadline. Arteta said this on Saturday after Arsenal defeated Sheffield United 2-1 in the Premier League at Emirates, thanks to two goals from Bukayo Saka and Nicolas Pepe. The Spaniard said Bellerin told him he was 100% committed to the Gunners, adding that the 25-year-old now sees what the North London club are trying to do this season. “Yes [I was worried that Bellerin would leave], because I understand a lot of things happened in his trajectory at the club,” Arteta was quoted by Football London as saying after the match. “What I liked is he said to me ‘I can see what we are trying to do’. It was a completely different player I could see. We need to keep him fit as well. “He told me he’s 100% committed to be here and that’s the type of player we need.”

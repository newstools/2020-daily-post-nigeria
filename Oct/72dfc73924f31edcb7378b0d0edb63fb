Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has warned Arsenal that they must end their losing run in the Premier League when they face the Red Devils at Old Trafford this weekend. Arsenal has lost their last two Premier League matches against Manchester City and Leicester City respectively. But Ferdinand wants Mikel Arteta’s side to implement a “mentality shift” when they tackle Man United, adding that the Gunners must respond against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men. “They [Arsenal] have been having a party since Partey signed. Reality hits home now,” Ferdinand said on his FIVE YouTube channel. “They have got to respond. I have said it about Everton, and I am going to say the same thing about Arsenal; it’s how you respond to these situations. “Too many times in the past, Arsenal have not responded in these situations and have gone on losing games, and they drift away. They cannot have that happen this season. “I think Arteta has been a breath of fresh air at the Emirates. This is now a big time to say to the boys: “Listen, you have lost, that is it, we move on”. “And that is the mentality shift that he has to implement in this squad. Can he do it? We will wait and see.” The kick-off time for the game is 5:30 pm.

President Muhammadu Buhari has thanked Professor Tijjani-Muhammad-Bande, the immediate past President of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) for making Nigeria proud. Receiving Professor Bande, the country’s Permanent Representative to the UN on Friday at the State House, Abuja, President Buhari lauded the Ambassador for a job well done. ”You had an opportunity to serve, and you did so well. Thank you very much. By a sort of coincidence, you and Amina (Ambassador Amina Mohammed, UN Deputy Secretary-General) served at the same time. When I addressed the UN, I felt so proud to see my countryman and woman sitting at my sides.” The President used the opportunity to ask for patience and understanding of the country’s development process, saying that it is something that takes time, but expressed optimism that advances in technology, education and experience will help to speed up the process. In his brief remarks, Professor Muhammad-Bande said he was full of gratitude and appreciation to President Buhari and the entire nation, for supporting him in his year-long tenure as President of the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly. He thanked the Nigerian Leader for giving him a chance to serve and the subsequent support. ”You gave me an assignment; you gave me whatever I needed. You provided for my success. The trust you gave and your leadership got us through”, Muhammad-Bande told the President. Having been reappointed, Professor Muhammad-Bande continues in his position as Nigeria’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, New York.

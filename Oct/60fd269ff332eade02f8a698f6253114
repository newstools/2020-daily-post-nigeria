The Ondo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has accused the major opposition party in the state, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, of fuelling violent attacks in the state through its campaign slogan. According to the APC in a statement by its State Publicity, Alex Kalejaye, the PDP campaign slogan for Ondo 2020 tagged ‘Eyitayo must not fail’ is a new version of the old “do-or-die” approach to election matters. While emphasizing that PDP youths are easily moved to action once they hear the slogan, Kalejaye stressed that the slogan is an indication that the PDP candidate and leaders are very desperate for power. Kalejaye said, “This seeming desperation in the camp of the PDP flag bearer induces the party thugs to go wild, and destroy anything in sight. So many innocent people have fallen victims, in the last one week, and vehicles destroyed because they display Akeredolu stickers.” The party urged the leaders of PDP to further educate their followers to exhibit better conducts ahead of Saturday’s election. Kalejaye who expressed optimism that the APC would emerge victorious in the gubernatorial election, “because all the active political actors in the State, from Prof. Ajayi Borroffice, Senator Tayo Alasoadura, to Chief Olusola Oke, are all committed to the reelection bid of Akeredolu.” “Our concern is to ensure we record a credible process that will be a source of pride to the Sunshine State,” he stated.

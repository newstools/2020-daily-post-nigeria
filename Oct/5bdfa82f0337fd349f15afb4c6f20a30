President Muhammadu Buhari has given ministers in his cabinet until next week, to submit reports of their consultations with their constituents on the ongoing #ENDSARS protests. The protests were hijacked by hoodlums all across the country, resulting in looting and arson of properties. Last week, during the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, Buhari told the Ministers to go and interface with their constituents in a bid to stop the looting and burning of government and private properties. Speaking on the Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Chief Femi Adesina, said: “I can tell you because there was another Federal Executive Council meeting yesterday (Wednesday), the president asked for briefs from ministers who went out. “Only two had their reports ready as at yesterday because some others were still in their respective states still carrying out their assignment. “So, the president said all of them should turn in their reports through the Secretary to the Government of the Federation in the incoming week.”

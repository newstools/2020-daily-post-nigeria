A prophet with Celestial Church of Christ, Oluwakemi Sotonode also known as Marvelous, has been arrested by the Ogun State police for allegedly obtaining money running into millions of naira from many people under false pretence. According to a statement by Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, the self-styled prophet of C.C.C, Marvelous Model Parish, Obada-Oko, has been on wanted list of the command for quite some time when a petition was received by the command from one Idris Ilyas on the 11th of November 2019 in which he reported that the suspect contacted him to supply Kaolin stone to a company, and that when he did, the suspect went to the company, received the sum of N1.2million on his behalf and converted it to her own use. “Also, on the 30th of September 2020, the same prophet collected the sum of N200,000 from one Olabangboye Olalekan under the pretence that she would sell a plot of land for him at Obada-Oko area of the state but disappeared after collecting the money. “Likewise in April this year, the same suspect contacted one Kehinde Ojekunle to supply Kaolin worth of N300,000 to a company and she went behind her, collected the money on her behalf and converted it to her own use. “In March 2020, the same suspect obtained the sum of N670,000 from one Gbolagade Damilola under the pretence of supplying her 40 bags of rice but she ran away since then.

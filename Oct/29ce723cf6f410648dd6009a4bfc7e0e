Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has warned his players to keep up their attitude, when they face Manchester United in the Premier League this weekend. The Gunners bounced back from a 1-0 home defeat against Leicester City, with a 3-0 victory over Dundalk in the Europa League on Thursday night. Eddie Nketiah, Joe Willock and Nicolas Pepe all scored as Arsenal took control of Group B with six points from two games. Arteta, speaking after the game, urged his players to quickly turn their attentions to this weekend trip to Old Trafford, where they face a rampant United side unbeaten in their last four matches. “After losing the way we lost against Leicester, it was painful at home and took us a few days to digest that defeat. “But you have to react straightaway with a win, with this type of attitude and let’s get ready. “We go to Old Trafford and we try to win again,” Arteta said. Arsenal have lost three of their opening six fixtures in the league this season.

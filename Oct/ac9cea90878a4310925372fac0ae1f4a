The Lagos State Government has directed all students in public and private schools to stay at home following the tension generated by the End SARS protests in the state. The state Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folasade Adefisayo, issued the directive, on Monday stating that the safety of the students, parents and all staff working in schools was more important “at this critical period.” She urged parents to keep an eye on their wards and not allow them to be used as willing tools in the hands of those who might want to hijack the protests to unleash chaos on the society. The Commissioner also encouraged schools to utilize other means of distance teaching and learning such as radio, television and online media as they have been doing during and post coronavirus lockdown. She further revealed that a new date of resumption for all classes will be announced as soon as possible.

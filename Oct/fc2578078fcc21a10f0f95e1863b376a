The COVID-19 Presidential Task Force, PTF, on Monday, said states are responsible for the safe reopening of schools. PTF Chairman, Boss Mustapha, disclosed this during the committee’s daily briefing in Abuja, NAN reports. Mustapha, who is the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, said that the federal government would only provide necessary guidelines for the reopening. He said, “We wish to reiterate that federating units have the responsibility of determining the dates and modalities for the safe reopening, while the Federal Government provides the guidelines. “The PTF is glad that the economy is opening up the more, but warns that as we continue to study developments in Europe and other parts of the world, no nation can be said to be immune to a possible second wave, if the guidelines and protocols are not adhered to strictly. “Nigerians need to anticipate this and prepare. Our hope and prayers are that it shall never happen.”

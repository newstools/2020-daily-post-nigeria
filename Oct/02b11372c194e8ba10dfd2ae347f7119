Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has approved the full resumption of markets in the state. All food and non-food markets can now operate every day and at their usual hours. Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs, Dr Wale Ahmed, made the announcement in a statement on Tuesday. He said Sanwo-Oluâ€™s decision was to enhance trade and mitigate the hardship of recent times to ensure that residents can recover fast. The government advised traders and market operators to continue to observe safety protocols to prevent a possible resurgence of COVID-19. Markets were shut nationwide at the peak of the pandemic. Their operating hours and days were later rationed after coronavirus cases dropped significantly.

The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, was at the Presidential Villa in Abuja on Tuesday, to meet with President Muhammadu Buhari. Akeredolu, who secured his second term in office by winning last Saturday’s governorship election, presented his Certificate of Return to Buhari. Speaking with State House correspondent afterwards, he called on his current deputy, Agboola Ajayi, to resign if he still has any honour in him. Ajayi had dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) first to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and later to the Zenith Labour Party (ZLP). He finished third in the poll after Akeredolu and PDP’s Eyitayo Jegede. Akeredolu has made it clear that even if Ajayi refuses to resign; his days are numbered since a new deputy would soon be inaugurated. He said, “God has given us victory, who am I to harbour enmity against anybody? it is not necessary. So, if he (Ajayi) comes back, if he has honour anyway, he should resign and leave as Deputy Governor if he has honour. “But if he decides not to, if opportunities are there, I am sure the party will take a decision on him because he is no longer in our party, he has gone to another party. “He has been in three parties within a month, wonderful man. From APC to PDP, from PDP to ZLP, he is a wonderful man.”

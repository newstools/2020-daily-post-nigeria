Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has reacted to President Buhari’s nomination if Lauretta Onochie, his personal assistant on Social Media as a Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Onochie who hails from Delta State was named alongside three others and for confirmation by the senate in line with the laws that set up the electoral umpire. Part of the letter was read by the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan on Tuesday at the plenary. However, Sani said the last senate led by former Senate President Bukola Saraki would have rejected her nomination. He pointed out that the current Lawan-led Senate can’t reject Onochie’s nomination. In a tweet, the former lawmaker wrote: “Lawan Senate can’t reject her, if it were Saraki Senate she wouldn’t near the gate lai lai, when she sees Dino face.”

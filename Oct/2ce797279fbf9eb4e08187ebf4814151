A former Secretary to Oyo State Government, Barrister Sharafadeen Abiodun Alli, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately fish out the killers of Lekki protesters. DAILY POST recalls that some protesters were killed in Lekki area of Lagos on Tuesday. But, Alli who contested the gubernatorial election on the platform of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) in 2019, charged the Federal Government and the Nigerian Army to fish out the killers of the innocent protesters at Lekki toll gate on Tuesday night. He said the posture of the military high command which was currently at variance with the Lagos State Government on the killers of the hapless citizens, had shown that there was more to the said attacks than what the Nigerian government was making Nigerians to believe. Alli said while Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu claimed those beyond his control (soldiers) were behind the attack, the military authority posited that those behind the attacks were not known to it. Alli, then advised the government to immediately set up an high powered investigation panel to unravel the killers as the claim of ‘unknown soldiers’ was not acceptable to all Nigerians. Alli in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Thursday sympathise with families and everyone who have lost loved ones during this sad occurrence. He urged Buhari to apologise to Nigerians on the recent developments. According to him, the soldiers cannot carry out such operations without receiving order from the President and Commander in Chief of the armed forces. “It is unfair for government to deploy armed personnel to attack unarmed youth who are embarking on peaceful protest, demanding for their right. It is time for the president to use this opportunity to address Nigerians. “It is still controllable if the government can take responsibility for the recent developments in our polity. The presidency should be humble enough to apologise to Nigerians”.

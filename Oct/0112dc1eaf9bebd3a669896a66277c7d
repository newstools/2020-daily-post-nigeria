The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s address to the nation on Thursday evening, as disappointing and completely disconnected from the realities of the tragic occurrences in our country in the last two weeks. This was contained in a statement signed by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan. PDP, however, appealed to Nigerians to remain calm and allow a return to normal life. “Our party and, indeed, all lovers of peace in our country, were shocked that Mr. President glossed over the immediate trigger of violent protests – the widely condemned killing at the Lekki Toll Gate by security operatives. A situation which created a global concern and drew the attention of the world to the abuse of human rights going on in our country under his watch,” it read in part. The opposition party also criticized Buhari for his silence on the demand for investigation into the Military’s involvement in the shootings. It added that “Nigerians had expected that Mr. President will provide the lead for the much-needed overhauling of our security architecture to meet the demands of professionalism and respect for rules of engagement.”

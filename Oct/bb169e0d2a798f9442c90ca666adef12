Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has included Petr Cech in his 25-man Premier League squad. The 38-year-old has been named along other three goalkeepers: Kepa Arrizabalaga, Willy Caballero and Edouard Mendy. A club statement read: “Petr Cech has been included in the squad as emergency goalkeeper cover. “This is a precautionary step due to the unprecedented conditions currently caused by the COVID-19 crisis. He takes up a position as a non-contract player.” Cech currently works as a technical adviser at the club and made his professional appearance for Arsenal in the 2019 Europa League final against Chelsea in 2019. Before then, the Czech made 494 appearances for the Blues between 2004 and 2015.

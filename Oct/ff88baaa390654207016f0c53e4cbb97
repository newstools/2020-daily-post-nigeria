Alex Telles has missed Manchester United’s last two matches after testing positive for COVID-19, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed. After making his debut against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League last week, Telles was left out of the squad that drew 0-0 with Chelsea in the Premier League last weekend. The defender was also absent as Solskjaer’s side crushed RB Leipzig 5-0 on Wednesday night and Solskjaer has revealed why. He said: “Telles has tested positive for coronavirus. He’s been out for a few days. No symptoms, he’ll be fine, back soon.” Telles becomes the second member of the first team to have tested positive, after Paul Pogba missed international duty in September having contracted the virus. United’s next game is this Sunday against Arsenal at Old Trafford.

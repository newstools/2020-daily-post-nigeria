Thomas Partey has expressed his gratitude to Atletico Madrid’s fans, team-mates and coaching staff, after completing a deadline day move to Arsenal. The Gunners revived their interest early on Monday and triggered the Partey’s £45million release clause. The 27-year-old midfielder has now put pen to paper on a four-year deal at the Emirates and will earn £250,000-a-week, making him the third-highest paid player at the club behind Mesut Ozil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. He will wear the No.18 shirt at Arsenal. Partey wrote on Instagram: “Dear Atletico fans, today I only have words of gratitude for you. “For several years now, Atletico Madrid has been my home and this family will always be a part of me. “I want to thank the club for the trust placed in me from day one, but above all, I want to thank you, this wonderful fanbase that accepted me from the first moment and one that never stops believing in both the good and the bad times. “Atletico Madrid is not just a club, it is a family. Thank you.”

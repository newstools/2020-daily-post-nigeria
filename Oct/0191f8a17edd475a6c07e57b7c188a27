Arsene Wenger has admitted he was also left frustrated by Mesut Ozil at the club and has offered Mikel Arteta advice on how best to utilize the player. Ozil has not played under Arteta since football resumed after the COVID-19 lockdown. The 32-year-old appears to have played his last game for the Gunners, after he was dropped from their 25-man Europa League squad this week. It is believed Arteta will also exclude him from the squad for the Premier League, to be submitted later in October. Wenger sanctioned what was then a club-record £42.5million fee to sign Ozil from Real Madrid seven years ago and he explains that to get the best out of the German playmaker, he must be surrounded by defensive players. He told Der Spiegel: “He wasn’t exactly the one with the greatest discipline on the pitch. And his game against the ball wasn’t his forte. “But you can deal with that if you put some more defensively thinking players at his side. The main thing is the balance between attack and defence is right. It is no coincidence that (players like Ozil) seem so calm on the ball. They take in more information than others and therefore play deliberately.”

Deji Adeyanju, convener of Concerned Nigerians, has reacted to the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu’s ban on Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad, F-SARS. Adeyanju said the ban should not be rhetorics but permanent. In a tweet, the activist stressed that SARS operatives should not be seen on the roads again. “We don’t want to see SARS on Nigerian roads again after few weeks. This ban should be permanent. #EndSARS. “Don’t let this ban be rhetorics as usual. The suffering and injustice must end. #EndSARS,” he tweeted.

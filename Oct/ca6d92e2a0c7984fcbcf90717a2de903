And by the next day, the ransom had been increased to N200million because everybody had reported that I was missing. “I want to thank the Governor of Rivers State, the NBA President, the NBA Chairman in Port Harcourt, the Commissioner of Police and the Anti-Kidnapping Unit for all the efforts made to rescue me because as at Wednesday they had decided that they were going to kill me. “Some of them were violent because they just kept hitting me and some of them were saying that they were going to let me go if the ransom was paid. “At some point, they got very frantic that they threatened to kill me because they were certain that with the news that had gone round, somehow something was going to go wrong. They were planning to move me into the slump to kill me,” she said.

A total of 33 health workers in Adamawa State have been infected by coronavirus from the time of outbreak of the virus in the state to date. The state Chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Dr Abraham Tizhe, who disclosed this on Tuesday, said one of the affected health workers has died of the infection. Abraham Tizhe, who spoke at the opening of the 2020 Physicians’ Week in Yola, specified that the record covered the period when the disease broke out in the state on April 22, 2020, to now. The disclosure is instructive for a state, Adamawa, which prides itself as one of the least affected by the Coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria. The state, by the latest update posted by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), ranks 30th among the 36 states and Abuja with 248 confirmed cases, zero admission, 229 discharged cases, and 19 deaths. The state NMA Chairman said the marking of the Physicians’ Week demanded sober reflection in light of current realities with the Coronavirus pandemic. He said, “In Adamawa, confirmed cases of COVID-19 pandemic are 248 with 19 mortalities, and among them, 33 healthcare workers were infected and recorded one death. “It will suffice to mention that as at today, Oct. 20, 2020, in Nigeria, the confirmed cases are 61,440 with 1,125 mortality. And globally, there are 40,648,527 infections with 1,122,992 deaths.” He explained that the Physicians’ Week is an annual week-long event in all the branches of the NMA, to celebrate doctors who are contributing to effective health service delivery.

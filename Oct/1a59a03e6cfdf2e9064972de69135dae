President Muhammadu Buhari has said at least 69 people have been killed during the #EndSARS protests across the country. According to the BBC, Buhari gave the number during a virtual meeting with former leaders and security chiefs on Friday. He was quoted as saying 51 civilians, 11 police officers and seven soldiers had died. A statement released by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, at the end of the meeting also quoted Buhari as saying it is unfortunate that the “initial genuine and well-intended protest of youths was hijacked and misdirected”. The past Nigerian leaders present at the meeting included Gen. Yakubu Gowon, President Olusegun Obasanjo, Gen. Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, Chief Ernest Shonekan, Gen. Abulsalami Abubakar and former President Goodluck Jonathan. Each of them commended President Buhari for steps taken so far, in restoring peace and order in the country and also applauded the presidential broadcast of Thursday.

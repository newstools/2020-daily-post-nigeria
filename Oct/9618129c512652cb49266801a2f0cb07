The All Progressives Congress (APC) says the eligibility of its Lagos East by-election senatorial candidate, Tokunbo Abiru, is unquestionable. Publicity Secretary, Seye Oladejo, in a statement on Thursday, said there was no court suit challenging Abiru. There are reports that Abiru has been dragged to court case over purported double voter registration. The APC spokesman called it false and laughable. Oladejo noted that the plaintiffs have not availed themselves copy of the Electoral Act 2010 (As amended). “We understand their panic, fear and unease on account of the overwhelming and calamitous defeat that awaits them on the 31st of October, 2020. “They should do well to ask the traducers of Willie Obiano (of Anambra State) and Yahaya Bello (of Kogi State) and avail themselves of several other Court decisions in that respect,” Oladejo said. He told them to continue to chase shadows, adding that APC was focused on its campaign. The Lagos East poll will be held on October 31. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will on the same day conduct 14 legislative by-elections in 10 states.

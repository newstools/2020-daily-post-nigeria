Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has admitted he wished he could make 11 changes at half time, as his team fell 1-0 to Royal Antwerp in the Europa League on Thursday. Mourinho made four changes at the break and a fifth within 20 minutes of the restart. Dele Alli, Giovani Lo Celso, Steven Bergwijn and Carlos Vinicius did not appear for the second half, while Gareth Bale was hooked off soon. Still, Spurs failed to find an equalizer against the Belgian side. Spurs improved when Harry Kane, Erik Lamela, Heung-min Son, Lucas Moura and Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg came. “You know what our best team is, I always like to think the players deserve an opportunity. “We have a big squad. It’s also there opportunity to catch the chance with both hands and ask for more. “(After) tonight my future choices are going to be very easy,” Mourinho was quoted as saying by Football.London.

Former England striker, Peter Crouch, has urged Chelsea to ‘cash in’ on winger, Callum Hudson-Odoi. Hudson-Odoi has been strongly linked with a move away from Chelsea to Bayern Munich this summer. But Crouch believes now is the right time for Chelsea to sell Hudson-Odoi. He told BT Sport: “It comes down to what Frank thinks of the player [Callum Hudson-Odoi]. It is clear Hudson-Odoi has potential, and he’ll improve. “But has he improved since he was that 18-year-old who burst onto the scene and took our breath away? Maybe not. “I do not think he has improved at the level that I think they would have thought he would. “Maybe it is time [to cash in]. You look at Liverpool cashing in on Rhian Brewster. “If you can get a buy-back clause and a potential sell-on fee it might not be a bad deal given the amount of money and the investments Chelsea have already made.” Meanwhile, speaking about Hudson-Odoi’s future amid declared interest from Bayern Munich, Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, said the 19-year-old is part of his plans at Stamford Bridge this season. “He’s absolutely part of my plans here,” Lampard said after Chelsea’s 4-0 victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday.

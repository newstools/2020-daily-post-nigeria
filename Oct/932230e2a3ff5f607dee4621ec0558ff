Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries, has rubbished President Muhammadu Buhari’s nationwide address over End SARS protest. Suleman described Buhari’s speech as insensitive and useless. He questioned the president’s failure to address the Lekki Toll Gate shooting in Lagos State. In a tweet, the clergyman insisted that the broadcast was a waste of time. According to Apostle Suleman: “Never had a more ‘wasted 12mins’ all my life, insensitive and useless speech. Who gave the orders for people to be killed? “What’s the repercussions of such blatant impunity? nobody was fired for lives wasted?. “No compensation for victims family? I wish I can “unwatch” it.”

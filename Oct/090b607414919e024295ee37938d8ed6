Manchester United’s Paul Pogba has been told to “shut up and do something on the pitch”, after restating his dream of playing for Real Madrid. Speaking after France’s 7-1 friendly win over Ukraine, Pogba was asked about his future. He replied: “Of course, every footballer would love to play for Real Madrid and would dream about that. It’s a dream of mine, so why not one day? His comments did not sit well with German pundit, Jan-Aage Fjortoft who hit back at the 27-year-old. “It’s time that he shuts up and tries to do something on the pitch,” Fjortoft said on ESPN FC Former Liverpool right-back, Steve Nicol, who was also on the show added: “I don’t understand why players are so stupid. “Just because someone asked you a question, you don’t have to answer it.”

The Governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has admitted it was a “difficult” decision to impose a 24-hour curfew on the state. Sanwo-Olu announced the curfew earlier on Tuesday and it has since taken effect from 4 pm. According to him, security officials will de-escalate the violence around the state and arrest thugs and miscreants. “Imposing this curfew was difficult, especially as we have just returned from a COVID19 required lockdown. “This curfew will allow security officials to immediately restore order to the state, arrest thugs and miscreants that have disrupted the peace. “Peaceful protesters and residents of Lagos should obey the curfew and stay in their homes to allow our security forces take immediate action to de-escalate all the issues of violence occurring at this time,” he said.

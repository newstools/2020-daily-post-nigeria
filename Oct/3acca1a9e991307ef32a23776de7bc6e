A former Secretary to Oyo State government, Barrister Sharafadeen Abiodun Alli on Thursday said that secession is not the only solution to the array of problems militating against the survival of Nigeria. Alli, who contested a gubernatorial election on the platform of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) in 2019 in Oyo State made this declaration via a statement made available to DAILY POST in Ibadan. Alli while congratulating Nigeria as the country clocks 60, urged people of the State to continue to pray for better Oyo State and Nigeria at large. The former SSG while acknowledging the fact that many problems are confronting Nigeria, however, maintained that the call for secession is not the solution to the problems the country is facing. Alli, while insisting that Nigeria is yet to get to its desired destination, urged the people of the country to hope for a better future for the State and Nigeria as an entity. The Ekefa Balogun of Ibadanland while speaking further, urged Nigerians, especially those calling for secession to consider the dreams of the founding fathers of Nigeria and seek the realisation of the dream. “Though Nigeria is yet to get to its desired destination, the people should hope for a better future for the State and Nigeria as an entity. “Nigerians, especially those calling for secession should consider the dreams of the founding fathers of Nigeria and seek the realisation of the dream. The 2020 anniversary marking sixty years of self-rule is an opportunity to bless Nigeria and its existence as a nation. “60 years of Nigeria’s independence will mark a great new beginning of hope, peace, prosperity and abundance for its citizenry. Nigeria will be exalted! It will not fail, it will excel and rise beyond the imaginations of the world. “It will be a pride to Africa and the World. All that we had lost will be restored; where we have failed, we will succeed.”

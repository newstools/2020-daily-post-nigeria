Lyon midfielder, Houssem Aouar, has insisted he is not disappointed about missing out on a move to Arsenal. The Gunners had several offers rejected for the 22-year-old by the French club who were demanding a €60million (£55.5m) fee. Arsenal eventually landed Thomas Partey from Atletico Madrid in a €50million (£45m) deal on deadline day. Aouar, who made his debut for France in the 7-0 thrashing of Ukraine on Wednesday, remains adamant that he is happy to remain at Lyon. “Of course I asked myself all the necessary questions,” he said. “I am in the headspace to have a great season with my club and get back the points that we have lost. “So of course we are going to try to have the best season and to try to put Lyon back in its rightful place, at the top of France. “Disappointed? I am the opposite. I am at home, in the club that I love, with my friends and my family.”

Newcastle United legend, Alan Shearer, has singled out three Manchester United stars for praise following the Red Devils’ Premier League 4-1 victory against the Magpies on Saturday night. The three players are Bruno Fernandes, Marcus Rashford and Juan Mata. Shearer believes Fernandes, Rashford and Mata destroyed his former club, Newcastle because the trio displayed exceptional performances against the host. According to him, Fernandes and Mata caused Newcastle problems during the duration of the encounter, while Rashford was excellent in his goal and assists. Man United defeated Newcastle United at St James’ Park, thanks to four goals from Harry Maguire, Bruno Fernandes, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Marcus Rashford. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men bounced back from their embarrassing 6-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur before the international break. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer deserves credit for changing the team. That team needed to be changed after their last performance, and they played very well,” Shearer told Match of the Day. “They battered Newcastle. I thought Fernandes and Mata were so clever. They stood in those little pockets, in those holes, and Newcastle could not handle it. “They were just too good on the ball and showed so much creativity. “Those two on the ball, they can punish teams, and they caused problems all evening. “Rashford was excellent as well with his goal and two assists. The weight of passing from United was brilliant.”

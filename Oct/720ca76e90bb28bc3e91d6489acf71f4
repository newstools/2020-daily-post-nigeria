The Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, who also the Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Ondo State Election Campaign Committee has accused the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, for the incessant violent attacks in the state ahead of the October 10 governorship poll. Makinde stated this while lodging complaints over what he described as uncivilised and violent attacks on PDP members in Akure metropolis at the state police headquarters in Akure, the Ondo State capital. According to the Oyo State Governor, PDP had always made its campaigns issue-based, but emphasized that the APC government in Ondo State prefers violent attacks as a form of response. “Ondo people are tired and our numerous supporters have continuously been subjected to unfair treatment by those who hold the reins of power in the state. “But if they think what they did in Kogi is applicable here, they are making a mistake; because people are fully prepared for them.” Makinde, however, called on relevant security agencies not to shirk their responsibility of ensuring a peaceful, free and fair election come Saturday.

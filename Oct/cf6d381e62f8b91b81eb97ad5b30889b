Orji Kalu, former Abia State Governor, says Igbo people and other residents of Ondo State will vote for Governor Rotimi Akeredolu on Saturday. He stated that Akeredolu and the All Progressives Congress (APC) will win because of the governor’s “developmental strides”. The Senate Chief Whip, in a statement on Thursday, said Akeredolu had made life meaningful for the people regardless of tribe, religion and political differences. He called Akeredolu “a grassroots mobiliser, astute professional and consummate politician”. Orji appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the media, security agencies, civil society organisations and other stakeholders to ensure a credible election. “The people of Ondo State will no doubt re-validate the mandate of the governor because of his developmental strides,’’ Kalu said. The lawmaker said APC would not derail from its probity, transparency, accountability and good governance. The will of the people of Ondo State shall prevail on Saturday, Kalu added.

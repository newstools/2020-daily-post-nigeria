Nigerian rapper, Folarin Falana, also addressed as Falz, has told protesters in Lagos State to stay at home. Falz gave the advice following cases of thuggery and the curfew imposed by the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday. Sanwo-Olu had declared a 24-hour curfew in Lagos following the hijack of the End SARS protest by hoodlums. On Tuesday, a police station in Orile Iganmu and one other were set ablaze by some hoodlums posing as protesters. In a tweet, Falz shared a video of himself accusing the Lagos State Government of lacking what it takes to perform its duty of protecting lives and properties. He urged the protesters to stay at home pending the lifting of the curfew. According to him, there will be designated locations for the protesters going forward, to avoid hijack by hoodlums. “In the light of all the thuggery we’ve seen, and the curfew imposed in Lagos state, it is important that we all stay safe rather than lose more lives. “We are still adamant about our demands and this is just HALF TIME!! We shall be back once the curfew is lifted. “Please Lagos, let’s stay home and be law-abiding. They are desperate to have something on us but they will NEVER succeed. This movement is bigger than all of us! #EndSARS,” he said.

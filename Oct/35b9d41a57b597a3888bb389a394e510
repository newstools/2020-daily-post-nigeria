We believe that some of the discussions are for the consumption of Senators on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. Asked of the position of the controversial appointment of President Muhammadu Buhari’s media aide, Lauretta Onochie, the PDP National Chairman said “We believe that Senate would handle the issue of appointment of President Muhammadu Buhari’s Aide, Lauretta Onochie, so we don’t want to dabble into it. “We also discussed the issue of SARS and we believe that comprehensive Police reforms will be an answer to Police brutality of citizens. We also endorse five points raised by protesters as members of a political party and members of Senators that are here. “We also appeal to the government for adequate compensation for victims of SARS brutality. and I believe that when that is done with reforms as it pertains to the criminal justice system in our country with regards to the protection of lives and property: that is the way to go”, he submitted.

The NAFDAC Director-General, Mrs. Mojisola Christianah-Adeyeye,condemned the attack during a visit to the agency’s office on Monday, NAN reports. Adeyeye said that the drugs and other products taken away were fake and counterfeit and would affect the lives of people who use them. According to her, she was shocked by the incident. She however, appealed to residents not to take or buy drugs from illegitimate persons because their lives would be at risk. “My plea to residents is not to take the drugs because their lives are so precious. “This is not End SARS protest. When I was called and told about it, l couldn’t believe but seeing it in reality is so shocking. “This is not also stealing but waging war on government properties. “NAFDAC aim is to save lives. We cannot be derailed with this happening because it’s devastating news. “With the happening, it will slow our work a little but we are on rebound and that’s why I am here,” Christianah-Adeyeye said. She appealed to the staff to be calm as the agency would look for a way forward. “I am sorry for the happening because it is an invasion of your private space trying to safeguard the people. “We cannot touch anything for now until the insurance company comes to see it. This is a way to destroy a nation and what has happened here should be a turning point. “I pray this should be the last time that young people destroy government properties because NAFDAC is going to spend a lot of money to renovate the office,” she added.

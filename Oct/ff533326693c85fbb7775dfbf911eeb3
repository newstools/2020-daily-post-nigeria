Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, has restated his call for the total reform of the Nigeria Police Force. Governor Wike was speaking while addressing some Rivers women under the auspices of “Concerned Mothers in Rivers State “who came on #EndSARS protest march to Government House, Port Harcourt. Represented by his Deputy, Dr. Ipalibo Harry Banigo, Wike said that the State Government felt their pains. The Governor emphasised that it is only through total reform of the Police that the injustice meted to innocent citizens of the country would stop. “As a Government, we feel your pains and this injustice must surely stop. “To tell you the level of impunity, some SARS officers that were even caught on camera killing people were even promoted. “I want to thank you for the peaceful way you have conducted yourselves and assure you that we shall work together,” he stated. Speaking on behalf of the “Concerned Mothers in Rivers State”, Mrs. Ivy Davies Etokakpan said the protest was to lend their voices to end Police brutality in the country. Niger-Delta activist, Ankio Briggs and Nollywood actress, Hilda Dokubo were part of the protest.

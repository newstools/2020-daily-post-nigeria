The Broadcasting Organisation of Nigeria, BON, has demanded the immediate withdrawal of N9million fines slammed on AIT, Channels and Arise Televisions by the Nigeria Broadcasting Commission of Nigeria, NBC. BON believes that the penalty is too harsh in a democratic setting of Nigeria, which does not in any way follow due process before it was given. In a statement signed by its Chairman, Sa’a Ibrahim, the BON said before slamming the penalty, the commission should have queried the respected media outfits and await their responses. Sa’a Ibrahim said the television stations should be given a fair-hearing before any penalty was taken on them. “In any case the broadcasting commission should be more flexible in its dealings with organizations because we are in a democratic setting not the other way round, so the respected televisions should be given fair-hearing before any penalty “, BON insisted. NBC had slammed N3m fines each on AIT, Channels and Arise TV for their “unprofessional coverage” of the End SARS protests and the crisis that followed it.

The Lagos State Government has extended the start of the 24-hour curfew until 9 pm. It was initially announced to begin at 4 pm. According to a statement on their official Twitter page, the extension is to enable people who are stuck in traffic get to their destinations. It read: “Update! Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has directed that enforcement of the 24hour curfew in the State should not start until 9 pm to enable people stuck in traffic get to their destinations.” This comes amid news that security operatives have opened fire at protesters camped at the Lekki toll gate. The demonstrators have been there for more than 10 days.

The Federal High Court sitting in Bauchi on Thursday ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Bauchi State Independent Electoral Commission (BASIEC) to include 19 deregistered political parties in Saturday’s poll in the state. The parties, which are plaintiffs in the suit, marked FHC/BAU/CS/32/2020, had approached the court to challenge the decision of both INEC and BASIEC to expunge the parties from the forthcoming elections. By excluding them from the elections, the plaintiffs accused the electoral bodies of flouring the order of the Court of Appeal, Abuja, in the suit marked CA/ABJ/CV/507/2020, delivered on the 19th August, 2020 which reinstated them as registered political parties in the court. The appellate court’s lead judgement delivered by the President of Appeal Court, Justice M.B. Dongban-Mensem, held that there was no justification for INEC to deregister the parties. The Court, therefore, ordered the electoral body to reinstate the 22 parties which were deregistered by the electoral umpire for their inability to win an elective office during the 2019 general elections. Ruling on the plaintiffs’ application for an order of the court to be included in Saturday’s local government elections and the forthcoming by-elections in the state, the Federal High Court, Bauchi, affirmed the order of the Court of Appeal in Abuja. The presiding judge, Justice Hassan Dikko granted a leave of mandamus to the plaintiffs for the respondents to comply with the Appeal Court decision. “I hereby grant leave of mandamus to compel the respondents to comply with the judgement of the Court of Appeal in Abuja in suit number: CA/ABJ/CV/507/2020 enrolled on 19th day of August 2020,” the judge held. Justice Dikko ordered that a copy of the judgement be served on the respondents in their various addresses and fixed November 2, 2020, for the hearing of the case.

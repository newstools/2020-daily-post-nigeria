Real Madrid forward, Vinicius Junior, on Wednesday night broke UEFA Champions League record following his side’s 3-2 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk. Real Madrid were defeated at home against Shakhtar Donetsk, following three goals from Tete, Raphael Varane, (OG) and Manor Solomon. Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior did score for Zinedine Zidane’s side. However, according to MisterChip, Vinicius’s goal against Shakhtar is the fastest goal by a substitute player in Champions League history. The previous record (15 seconds) was jointly shared by Lars Ricken and Andy van der Meyde. Real Madrid’s next fixture is against Barcelona in the La Liga El Clasico this weekend.

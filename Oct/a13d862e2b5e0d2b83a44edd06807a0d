Winner of the 2020 edition of the Big Brother Naija reality TV show has debunked reports that he told Erica that he was a Sickle Cell carrier. Recall that after Laycon confirmed his sickle cell status last week of the show, Erica had come under attack. Some viewers had claimed that Laycon told her about his health issues, and she used it against him during an altercation which led to her disqualification. But speaking on Friday, Laycon said, ”I’m not the kind of guy that would want to get something out of pity. ”The only person I remember telling was Vee and I told her in a whisper because she respects information that I divulge to her.”

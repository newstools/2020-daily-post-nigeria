The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has set up a new unit to replace the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team will “fill the gaps” arising from the dissolution of SARS. This was contained in a statement signed by the Force spokesman, Frank Mba, on Tuesday. Mba confirmed that Adamu has “ordered all personnel of the defunct SARS to report at the Force Headquarters, Abuja for debriefing, psychological and medical examination. “The officers are expected to undergo this process as a prelude to further training and reorientation before being redeployed into mainstream policing duties. The medical examination will be carried out by the newly set-up Police Counselling and Support Unit (PCSU). It added that “the IGP has set up a new Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team that will fill the gaps arising from the dissolution of the defunct SARS. “Prospective members of this new team will also undergo psychological and medical examination to ascertain their fitness and eligibility for the new assignment.”

Lionel Messi’s barren run from open play continued on Saturday, as Barcelona lost 3-1 to Real Madrid. All Messi’s goals so far this season, have come from the penalty spot. And it was Ansu Fati who made it 1-1 for the Catalans, after Federico Valverde opened scoring in the Clasico. Sergio restored Madrid’s lead in the second half, stroking his penalty past Neto. Luka Modric ensured Zinedine Zidane’s took all three points with a late finish. The result means Ronald Koeman has lost two of his opening five LaLiga fixtures, while Los Blancos go top of the league.

A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has reacted to the rating of Nigerian beauty queen, Agbani Darego, as the ugliest Miss World ever by Google. Fani-Kayode said the assertion by Google is a deep insult on Nigeria, Africa and people of colour. Social media was agog yesterday when Nigerians discovered that Google ranked their most successful beauty queen, Darego the ugliest among other winners of the world’s most prestigious pageantry show. And Fani-Kayode, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, said “The assertion that Agbani Darego is the ‘ugliest Miss World ever’ is false,” he tweeted “It is also deeply insulting to Nigeria, Africa and all people of color& it is utterly racist. Agbani remains one of the most beautiful women in the world& I am proud of the fact that she is a Nigerian,” he said. The former minister noted that Africa has always taken the front row when it comes to pageantry be it, Miss World, Miss United Nations or Miss Universe. He added that “Africa has always produced winners and the most beautiful women in the world. No-one can take that away from us.”

Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has claimed that Mauricio Pochettino will be the man to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at the club. Berbatov, speaking to BetFair, said that Solskjaer will continue to be under pressure if United’s form does not improve and the club will be forced to take a decision. The Red Devils were whitewashed 6-1 at home by Pochettino’s former club Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. The result means that Solskjaer’s men have picked up just three points from their opening three games and are lying in 16th place in the table. “The pressure on him will only continue to grow, and if they continue to fail to win points, the point will likely come where action is taken. “I believe he is still fine for the job personally, and we will have to see. “To me, it is amazing that Mauricio Pochettino is available for this job, one of football’s finest coaches in my opinion,” Berbatov said. Pochettino has been out of a job since being sacked by Spurs 11 months ago.

A cleric in Imo State, Bishop Uzoma Emmanuel has condemned the extra judicial killings of some innocent and unarmed youths who were protesting against police brutality in the country. The prelate decried the recent happenings in the country and blamed the presidency for not nipping them in the bud. Fielding questions from journalists in Owerri, Bishop Uzoma argued that the countryâ€™s problems would have been solved if the leaders were sensitive to the plight of the people that elected them. He maintained that President Muhammadu Buhari should quickly tender his resignation on account of incompetence. He, however, lauded the Federal Government for disbanding the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for failing the nation but at the same time frowned at the inauguration of SWAT to replace SARS. The cleric further urged the Inspector General of Police and the Federal Government to dissolve SWAT as, according to him, it amounts to selling a dog to buy a he-goat. He further stated that those police officers found guilty in the killings of the unarmed citizens be publicly brought to book, soliciting that compensation be paid to families that were affected and assaulted during the protests. He opined that the police needs reforms and retraining in order to keep abreast of the trends in their profession.

The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Wednesday, linked the shooting at the lekki toll gate in Lagos State to Bola Tinubu, National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC. IPOB alleged that Tinubu “aided and abated” the killings of End SARS protesters by gunmen believed to be soldiers at the Lekki toll gate. A statement by IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful, said the APC National Chairman won’t be allowed to enjoy his alleged stolen wealth. According to Powerful: “IPOB is calling on all the revolutionists to organize themselves together and bring down every property belonging to former Gov Ahmed Tinubu. “He can’t aid and abate the killing of peaceful protesters in Lekki and expect to enjoy his stolen wealth in peace. “Other wicked politicians masterminding this carnage or supporting Fulani terrorist government tormenting Nigerians should also be made to reap the reward of their atrocities.”

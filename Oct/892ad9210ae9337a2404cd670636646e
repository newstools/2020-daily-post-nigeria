Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has left Mesut Ozil out of his 25-man Premier League squad. Ozil had also been cut out from the Europa League squad. This decision means that the 31-year-old will not play for the Gunners until February and is likely to have played his final game for the club. Arsene Wenger, who brought Ozil to Arsenal in 2013, has advised the playmaker to focus on staying in shape in preparation for his next transfer. Wenger told Sky Sports: “You practice every day and you make sure that your level doesn’t drop and that you can go somewhere else after and play somewhere else.” When asked if he has spoken to Ozil, Wenger said: “No, I haven’t spoken to him since I left. “Because I decided to take a distance and not interfere with anything.”

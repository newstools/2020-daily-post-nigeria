Sule Lamido, a former Governor of Jigawa State, and the former presidential aspirant says he cannot pray for the success of the President Muhammadu Buhari and All Progressives Congress, APC government. The former Governor said this when he appeared on BBC Hausa, insisting that at 60, the country has recorded a number of successes despite many setbacks. “You can’t say in the past 60 years of our independence that there is no progress, there is,” he said. “But, honestly, our leaders are not taking advantage of the natural resources we have in the country to make us progress and live better.” Lamido maintained that he cannot pray for the success of the Buhari government because he belongs to the opposition and that Nigerians called members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, thieves and voted for the APC. The former Governor said it is now for Nigerians to weigh the Buhari administration and see the difference between the past and the present. “I am from an opposition party, no matter how much I love Buhari or his cabinet, I can’t enter the mosque and pray for him. “People called us [PDP] thieves and voted for the APC. So, it is left for them to judge now. “If Buhari is doing good, they know and let him lead Nigeria forever, but if he is doing wrong, we are always there to come and take over to do the right thing.”

Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted some of the Premier League fixtures that will be played this weekend. Match Day 7 kicked off on Friday, with Wolverhampton Wanderers defeating Crystal Palace 2-0. On Saturday, Manchester City travel to Sheffield United, Burnley welcome Chelsea and champions Liverpool take on West Ham. Berbatov expects a win for City, but feels Chelsea and Liverpool will drop points. He told BetFair: “Sheffield vs Man City: This is straightforward, Sheffield can’t win a game and Man City are so strong. They have too much quality here, even though they were poor against West Ham, they are still so strong. They will be too good for Sheffield here. Prediction: 0-4. “Burnley vs Chelsea: Burnley have disappointed this season after a decent season last year. Chelsea were good in the Champions League last night and were good in their draw against United though, what a boring game that was! I think Burnley might surprise Chelsea here and nick a draw. Prediction: 0-0. “West Ham are the one team I always say struggle to be consistent. Liverpool have a lot of defensive injuries and have looked weak at the back more than once this season. I think West Ham can grab a draw here. Liverpool have been leaking goals. Prediction: 1-1.”

Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to put an end to shooting of protesters by security agents. Saraki, while describing the shooting incident as a massacre, called for great patience, restraint and compassion in handling the demands of the youth. According to him, dialogue is the only logical option in the current situation— and not violence, adding that It was unacceptable for any Government to turn its weapons on its own young people. ”We must do all that is necessary to protect and engage with them on all issues. Please let the shooting stop and let fruitful dialogue commence. ”Killing our young and defenseless children under any circumstances is wrong. Period. Killing our children is also killing our future as a nation. We must walk back from this. Mr. President this is what needs to be done. I appeal to you to do the right thing,” he said. Saraki said he was horrified by the use of lethal force against End SARS and his heart bleeds for this country. ”This harassment and extrajudicial killing of Nigerians must stop immediately and the security agents who carried out this exercise should be brought to justice. No life of any Nigerian youth taking part in a peaceful protest deserves to be taken. ”This is not the Nigeria that we hope to leave for the next generation. Our young people are the future,” he added. He noted that although dialogue may take a longer time to work, the violent silencing of protesting youth is not an option.

The Governor, while speaking, said it is unfortunate that hoodlums and criminals have taken advantage of government’s action to wantonly loot government and private property, including private business premises and homes in several parts of the State this morning. Oyetola described the act of looting as unacceptable and it stands condemned. “This inevitable conclusion was reached to avert the continuation of this irresponsible act, especially now that the genuine protesters have suspended their protest earlier today. “My fellow citizens, the declaration of a 24-hour curfew, which will be indefinite until further notice, is to prevent the current state of anarchy from degenerating into large-scale breakdown of law and order. “For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no vehicular (including Okada) or human movement during this period. Only those on essential duties will be permitted to move around. These persons too must carry with them proper identification to allow access. “Violators of the curfew rules shall be prosecuted in line with the extant laws of the State. “I enjoin all our citizens and residents to return home and remain in their homes until further notice,” he said.

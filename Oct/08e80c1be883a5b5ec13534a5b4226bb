The Presidency has explained why President Muhammadu Buhari compared the fuel price in Saudi Arabia to that of Nigeria during his Independence Day national broadcast on October 1. The Presidency also said it was unwise and unfair for the government to subsidize the cost of petrol for city dwellers while the farmers and herders who have no cars nor generators are left with nothing. During his broadcast yesterday, Buhari said fuel will now be sold at N161 per liter in Nigeria, noting that other nations such as Ghana, Niger, Chad Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries sell petrol on a higher price than Nigeria. Asked why the President made the comparison during his appearance on Channels Television on Friday, Garba Shehu, a Senior Special Assistant to the President Media and Publicity, said, “We belong to a global market system. We are buying mostly our refined products from the international market. “Is it fair that the taxpayers’ money…how many Nigerians have cars anyway?

How much comes to Nigeria when you look at our technical cost? …”

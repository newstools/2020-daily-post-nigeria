Beneficiaries of Batch A and B of the N-Power programme, who were omitted from receiving their stipends, have been directed by the Federal Government to report to their various state focal persons for verification and revalidation. This directive was given by the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar-Farouq, in Abuja on Tuesday. According to the minister, measures to resolve unpaid stipends withheld for various reasons were almost being concluded. Farouk said that beneficiaries affected now have another opportunity to verify and re-validate their eligibility. She added, “Beneficiaries are hereby directed to report to their State Focal Persons immediately with their bank account details, including bank statements from March 2020 to date, NYSC Discharge Certificates, birth certificates and other related screening documents.” The minister said the verification will not last longer than 13th of October 2020, adding that beneficiaries who fail to attend the verification exercise would have to let go of their stipends.

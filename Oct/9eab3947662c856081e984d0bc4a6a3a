According to him, “The management of a food processing company whose stores were looted in Kakuri has also disclosed that the stolen grains have been treated with chemical preservatives which render them unsafe for consumption. “Residents of Kaduna State are hereby notified to be vigilant and careful about the source of food and medications they take and where they buy them, to avoid these dangers. “The Kaduna State Government appeals to the public for information on the identities of the looters and where they might be hiding the stolen items,” the statement added.

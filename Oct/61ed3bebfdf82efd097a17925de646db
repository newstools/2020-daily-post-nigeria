The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, has claimed that the October 10 governorship poll, will be the last he will contest in the state. Akeredolu stated this on Tuesday while addressing the National Peace Committee and his opponents. At the event, the Governor and all the other candidates signed a peace accord, pledging a violence-free election. “This won’t be our first election, at least for me. This will be the third time around that I will be contesting in the state. And this will be the third and last time that I will be contesting an election in Ondo State. “We went through elections in the last two occasions, all of us operating as brothers. I cannot recollect any violence in those two elections. But if we have one or two issues here and there, it is not to say that Ondo people are violent. Ondo State people, maybe learning from experience, have refused to be involved in violence. Elections here have always been peaceful. “I can assure you that the election slated for Saturday will be peaceful for as long as our security agencies are there. Our people are not ones to confront civil defence talk of the police or soldiers. Ondo State people are peace-loving people. “I will also still address the people on the need to avoid violence. A number of us who are contesting in the election talk to each other because we are colleagues,” Akeredolu said.

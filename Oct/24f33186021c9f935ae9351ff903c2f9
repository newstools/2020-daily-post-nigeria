End SARS protesters on Wednesday shut down streets of the Anambra State capital, Awka, calling for a total reform of the Nigeria Police Force. The protesters also demanded the prosecution of a former SARS boss in Anambra, CSP James Nwafor who headed the squad in Anambra, accusing him of killing and maiming countless young people.

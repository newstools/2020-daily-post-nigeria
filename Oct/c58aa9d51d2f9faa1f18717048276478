The Ekiti Government has ordered the immediate closure of all private and public schools following continued End SARS protests across the state. The State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Dr Kofoworola Aderiye, disclosed this in a statement issued on Tuesday in Ado-Ekiti by Abimbola Dada, the Chief Information Officer in the ministry. He said that the decision to close schools was a proactive step to safeguard the lives of pupils, students, teachers and other staff in the schools. ”It is also to accommodate difficulty being encountered by those finding it difficult to get to their respective schools,“ he said.
Aderiye also said that school activities would resume on Oct. 26.

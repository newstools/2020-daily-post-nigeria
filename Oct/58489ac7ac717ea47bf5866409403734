An Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, OYC, has urged End SARS protesters to allow peace to return in southern Nigeria, asserting that untold hardship posed a serious danger if the protest by the citizenry continues. OYC, in a release signed by its President, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro and made available to newsmen, on Friday night, noted that the protest had inflicted untold hardship and misery on Nigerians, dismissing the alleged killing of northerners in the southern part of the country. The Igbo youth group maintained that southern Nigeria remained safe despite the violence that trailed the End SARS protest. It commended the leadership of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum for the maturity exhibited in the midst of the current turmoil ravaging across Nigeria. According to OYC in its release, “We have urgently reached out to the leadership of Arewa youths to ensure that safety of Igbos in the 19 northern states was guaranteed in the interests of national unity and peaceful co-existence. “We have the assurances of northern youths led by the President of Arewa Consultative Youth Forum, Alhaji Yerima Shettima that the safety and security of Igbos are guaranteed in the north. There will be no attacks or purported threats on the lives and properties of Igbos in the north. While OYC in return, described this gesture exhibited by northern Youths as an act of patriotism and building up trust and commitment towards promoting peace, unity and security. “We assure safety of northerners in the South east zone. Anyone fanning the waves of violence and chaos across the South east region is an enemy of Igbo. Posterity will be inevitably unkind to any acclaimed leader that incites violence through unguided utterances in the South east.”

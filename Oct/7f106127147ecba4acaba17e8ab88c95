Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has named Carlo Ancelotti’s Everton as the Reds’ “next proper challenger” in the Premier League this season. Klopp said this on Friday ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League Merseyside derby against Everton on Saturday afternoon. Everton is the only team in the Premier League to remain unbeaten after four matches this season. Ancelotti’s men are currently on top of the Premier League table with 12 points from four games, while Liverpool is placed fifth with points from the same number of games. “What I think about Carlo Ancelloti was never a secret. I couldn’t respect him more. He’s a wonderful human being,” Klopp told BBC Football Focus. “When I heard he was going to sign for Everton I thought ‘Uhhh, the next proper challenger inline’. They did the perfect business in the summer. “They found exactly the players that they needed to improve an already pretty good football team. Together, getting more used to what Carlo wants them to do makes them a pretty strong team.”

The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has called on the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to arrest those disturbing the peace of the society in the name of End SARS protest. DAILY POST reports that the End SARS protest, which started in Lagos a few days ago, has spread to other parts of Nigeria. A policeman was said to have been killed by protesters in Delta State on Thursday while a police station was vandalised in Ogun State on Friday. Reacting, NANS cautioned the protesters not to throw the country into unnecessary crisis, saying protests currently going on in some parts of the country may develop into a full-blown chaos if care was not taken. This was contained in a statement made available to DAILY POST by NANS National Public Relations Officer, Comrade Adeyemi Azeez in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, on Saturday. According to Adeyemi, the protests had already been hijacked by hoodlums who may take advantage to wreak havoc on other law-abiding citizens of the country. While conceding that the activities of the police force, not only that of SARS, should be reformed for optimal performance, Adeyemi warned that “we must be careful not to set the country on fire”. “We are aware that some internet fraudsters, in a bid to continue perpetrating their criminal acts, are mobilising hoodlums to protest against the activities of SARS,” he stated. Speaking further, the students body recalled that the IGP had ordered that SARS and other tactical units should no longer conduct checks neither should they mount road blocks. Adeyemi, however, expressed worries that the people behind these protests are not satisfied with this. “The police should not hesitate to arrest and prosecute anybody caught disturbing the peace of the public and causing violence all in the name of protest,” he stressed.

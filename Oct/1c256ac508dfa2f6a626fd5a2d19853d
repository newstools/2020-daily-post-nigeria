The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Corps (TRACE) has said that a truck crushed a middle-aged woman at Onihale area, near Owode-Ijako, in the state on Thursday. Mrs Temitope Oseni, the Owode-Ijako Unit Commander of TRACE, who spoke on behalf of the Corps Commander, Mr Seni Ogunyemi, told NAN in Ota, that the incident occurred at about 8:23 am. Oseni said that a FAW truck, marked BHN 1353, was inbound Onihale area when it suddenly lost control due to brake failure and rammed into a motorcyclist and a woman who was about to alight in front of her father’s hotel. According to her, two boxer motorcycles and four persons were involved in the accident, with a male sustaining injury. She said that the corpse of the deceased had been released to the family for burial, while the injured was taken to Famous Hospital at Iyana-Ilogbo, Ogun, for treatment. Oseni advised truck drivers and owners to ensure that their vehicles were in good condition before putting them on the road to avoid unnecessary loss of life. The TRACE unit commander also commiserated with the family of the victim and prayed to God to grant them the fortitude to bear the loss. She said, “the truck and the two motorcycles had been removed from the road to ease free flow of traffic in the area.”

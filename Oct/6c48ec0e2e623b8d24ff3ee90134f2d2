He noted that police officers are also humans, hence should protect themselves. He said: “So, no amount of provocation and insult will make us shy away from our responsibilities. “In as much as we are aware that the government is behind us, we will encourage you to continue to be professional and civic in performing your duties. “But if anybody touches or assault you, you can also protect yourself because when we talk of human right, the police are human, so the rights of police officers should also be protected. “We are sending the message that legally, we have the right to protect ourselves.”

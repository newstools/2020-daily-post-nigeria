Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, on Thursday, commiserated with the families of the victims of the Baruwa gas explosion at Ipaja area of the state. He expressed deep sorrow over the gas explosion that claimed lives and destroyed properties worth several millions of naira. Sanwo-Olu, in a statement signed by Mr. Gboyega Akosile, his Chief Press Secretary, described the incident as a sad memory in the life of the administration. He also said that the government would take stiffer measures against operators of gas plants and or any combustible items in Lagos to avoid future recurrence of such disaster. “The gas explosion this morning has left a sour taste in my mouth. “It’s a reminder of the dark episode of March this year at Abule Ado Soba when innocent lives were lost to gas explosions of monumental proportion and properties destroyed. “I really cannot believe that we would witness another such incident, no matter how little. “I wish to therefore register my heartfelt condolences to the families of those that lost their loved ones in the fire. I pray that God grant their souls eternal rest. “The reports I got showed that the explosion could’ve been avoided if the operators of the gas plant had adhered to safety guidelines. “Lives would’ve been saved, and properties too wouldn’t have been affected,” he said.

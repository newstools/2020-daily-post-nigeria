Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has blamed a loss of composure for their 7-2 defeat at Aston Villa on Sunday. Ollie Watkins scored a hat-trick in the first half, as the Reds conceded seven goals for the first time since 1963. The Premier League champions’ back-up goalkeeper, Adrian, had a night to forget as his mistake in passing out from the back, allowed Watkins to open scoring. “The first goal had an impact, but it shouldn’t. Adrian made a mistake but we conceded goals like this in the past. We lost the plot then,” Klopp told Sky Sports. “When Aston Villa won the ball, our protection was under average.” Despite Klopp’s change of system and personnel after the break, Liverpool still could not prevent Villa from exposing their high line, as deflected goals from John McGinn, Ross Barkley and Jack Grealish’s double sealed a shock win. “We had still good moments but our good moments led to nothing and their good moments always led to a chance or a goal. “They were flying and we were pretty open. All the things you should not do in a football game, we did tonight,” Klopp added. Liverpool travel to top-of-the-table Everton in the Merseyside derby after the international break.

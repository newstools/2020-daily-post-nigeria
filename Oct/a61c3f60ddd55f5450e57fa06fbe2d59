Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodger, has revealed that the tactical plan his team used to beat Arsenal in Sunday’s Premier League tie was to target Granit Xhaka’s positioning during the encounter. Rodgers explained that Arsenal’s formation allowed Leicester to exploit Xhaka in midfield. Leicester defeated Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, thanks to Jamie Vardy’s second-half goal. Arsenal controlled the match in the first half, but they failed to put the ball in the back of the net, with Alexandre Lacazette particularly guilty of squandering good chances for Mikel Arteta’s side. When asked if he changed Leicester’s tactics in response to Arsenal’s set-up, Rodgers told BBC Sport: “No, I think it was obviously a different set-up [from Arsenal], but how our organisation was it was able to cope. “It was just a few little changes, Xhaka coming out to the side meant that Dennis [Praet] could then press him instead of having to go on to the full-back, so that was just about detail “But apart from that, it was about closing the lines, making sure our concentration was good, and then when we had the ball looking to play through.” Rodgers added: “It is the first time they have lost [at home] this calendar this year, it tells you how strong they’ve been.”

Borno Governor, Babagana Zulum, on Wednesday, advised the President Muhammadu Buhari government to invite the Chadian military to help Nigeria fight Boko Haram. President Idriss Deby had declared that Chad will no longer participate in external military operations. He complained that allies had failed to go the extra mile in the fight against Boko Haram and ISWAP. In April, a major operation by the country eliminated 1,000 insurgents Now Zulum wants the Buhari administration to seek Chad’s support against the sects. He spoke when a Nigerian Governors Forum (NGF) delegation visited him over recent attacks on his convoy. About 30 security personnel and civilains were killed in the most recent ambush. NGF spokesman, Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, disclosed Zulum’s comments at the meeting with his colleague. The governor urged the government “to ensure that Chadian soldiers are invited to join the Nigeria Army in the fight against insurgency if any meaningful success is to be recorded on the battleground. Zulum rationalised that no single army anywhere in the world has ever succeeded in quelling insurgency. “He requested that the government looked into ways of complementing the efforts of the Nigeria Army with the Chadian soldiers, emphasising that it is not to undermine the Nigerian soldiers, but to help them in finishing the job within a realistic deadline.”

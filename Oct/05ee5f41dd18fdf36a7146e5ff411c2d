Festus Keyamo, the Minister of State, Labour and Employment, on Thursday, downplayed the possibility of Nigeria breaking up. Keyamo maintained that Nigeria’s breakup was no longer feasible. According to the minister, Nigeria’s history of inter-tribal marriages and investments makes it difficult for the country to separate. He stated this in a tweet while wishing Nigerians a happy 60th Independence Anniversary. “For the umpteen time, I say that our separation as a people is no longer feasible. Our long history of criss-cross marriages & investments is ’till death do us part’. “TOGETHER we will remain and we can pursue our own regional agenda within a united NIGERIA. Happy Independence Day,” Keyamo tweeted. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-844677 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201001_114024_283.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="720" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201001_114024_283.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201001_114024_283-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201001_114024_283-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201001_114024_283-80x80.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said their 6-1 loss to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, was his worst day ever at the club. United have now lost both home fixtures in the Premier League this season, conceding nine goals in the process. What made the defeat to Spurs all the more painful for Solskjaer, was that he lost to his predecessor, Jose Mourinho. Solskjaer, played for the Red Devils from 1996 to 2007 and has been manager since 2018, said he has not had a day as bad as Sunday. “It’s a horrible feeling, the worst day I’ve had as a Manchester United manager and player. “You don’t win games of football by making individual mistakes, errors, making a performance like that,” the Norwegian told Sky Sports.

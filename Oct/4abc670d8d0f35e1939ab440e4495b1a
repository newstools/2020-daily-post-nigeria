Manchester United are considering four alternatives to Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, according to Sky Sports. Dortmund set an August 10 deadline to agree a deal for Sancho, but United have been unable to meet their asking price. The Red Devils are now looking at Barcelona’s Ousmane Dembele, Ismaila Sarr of Watford, Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic and Edinson Cavani, who is now a free agent. United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is keen to add a forward before the summer transfer window closes on Monday, October 5. While Solskjaer’s first choice remains Sancho, Dembele is now a strong alternative on a loan deal. The 23-year-old was a club-record signing for Barcelona, when he arrived from Dortmund for €105m (£95.75m) in August 2017. Cavani, 33, Watford’s 22-year-old Sarr and Jovic, also 22, are also on United’s list. Manchester United have spent just £39m this summer, on Ajax midfielder Donny van de Beek.

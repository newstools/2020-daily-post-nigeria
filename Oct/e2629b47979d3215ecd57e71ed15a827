It is often argued that the future is female and pop-culture in recent times amplifies this notion. There has been an improvement in the representation of women in several sectors in the last two decades and we understand the role of the media as a platform to perpetuate gender imbalance and stereotypes in the society. At Guinness Nigeria (a Diageo company), championing Diversity and Inclusion is one of our performance ambitions and our commitment to shifting this agenda starting with gender has been globally acknowledged as Diageo was named amongst the top 25 most diverse and inclusive companies for the 4th consecutive year in 2019. In order to kick off our Progressive Gender Portrayal ambition in Nigeria, we have planned a series of activities which we would be unveiling in the coming weeks. One of the activities lined up is a virtual panel to discuss the topic: Progressive Female Portrayal in Advertising, Media and the Entertainment Industry slated for Thursday – 8th October, 2020 by 10 am – 12noon. We invite you to register via the link below to take part in what promises to be a riveting discussion. https://diageo.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_qAB5WSXVQWaDmZFoJ0vHUA

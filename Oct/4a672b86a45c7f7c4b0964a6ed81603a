Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Thursday, urged Nigerian youths to believe in the country because they are the future leaders. Sanwo-Olu gave the advice when he hosted sixty students from public and private schools on “Independence Day Conversation with Nigeria’s Future Diamonds” at Lagos House, Marina. “For you to be what you want to be, you must believe in this country, believe in yourself, because you’re the future leaders,” Sanwo-Olu said. “I want you to know that the future is about all of you, the future is for all of us, the future is what you believe for coming here today to be an inspiration for every one of you. “The 60th Anniversary celebration for me is to hand over the baton of leadership, it is to hand over the challenge to all of you.” According to Sanwo-Olu, the celebration is really to reflect on the theme for the 60th anniversary of Nigeria, which is togetherness. He added: “If anything that we all need to learn from, it’s the fact that in our last 60 years there has been so much division among ourselves, there has been so many reasons for us to want to believe that we’re not meant together. “But at the end of the day, it is really the strength in our togetherness that is the strongest strength and attributes that we can have. “I’m a strong believer in that togetherness so that in that togetherness, we can continue to review, realign, redo, but let us also continue to remain bigger, stronger together.”

Arsene Wenger has backed his former club, Arsenal, to finish in the top four this season. In an interview with the UK Guardian, Wenger said the Gunners could be the Premier League’s “surprise package”. The Frenchman noted that Mikel Arteta has brought in decent reinforcements this summer and will improve in his first full season. Arteta finished the last campaign in eighth place but won the FA Cup. Since then he has brought in Willian, Gabriel Magalhaes for £27million and activated a £45m release clause in Thomas Partey’s contract at Atletico Madrid. “I believe it will not be very difficult to improve on the number of points they got last season. “But I’m convinced Arsenal can be in the top four, if not more. Why not more? “They can be the surprise package for me this year: they bought well, they strengthened the defence well. And they kept the players who were already there. In my last year I bought [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang, they kept him. “They have every ingredient and no real weakness,” Wenger said.

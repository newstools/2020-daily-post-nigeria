The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has set up a task force to coordinate with security operatives to ensure the release of abducted lawyer, Bisola Ajayi. According to reports, Ajayi was abducted by unknown gunmen in front of her house in Port Harcourt while waiting for the gate man to open her gate. The NBA President, Olumide Akpata, in a tweet today disclosed the steps taken so far by the Association. “Last night, I received reports that Paulette Bisola Ajayi, a lawyer & daughter of Ngozi Ajayi (also a lawyer) was abducted by at least 4 gunmen dressed in combat fatigues & dark t-shirts in front of her home in Rumukurushi PH, as she was waiting for her gate to be opened. “Her mother and others who tried to prevent her from being taken away were brutalized and shot at by these men who eventually dragged Bisola out of her car and took her away in their own car…a white Toyota Venza. “The increasing spate of such incidents is indeed disheartening. I have spoken to Bisola’s mother to assure her of our support and assistance towards the rescue of her daughter. “I have also spoken to the Governor of Rivers State, the Attorney-General of Rivers State and the Rivers State Police Command to request their assistance in ensuring the safe return of our colleague. “I have also set up a Task Force to collaborate with the relevant authorities and do all that is possible to see to Bisola’s speedy release. She will also remain in our prayers.”

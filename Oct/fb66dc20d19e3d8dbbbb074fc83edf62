Lagos State Police Command has advised End SARS protesters to carry out their demonstrations in a peaceful manner. The command assured that its personnel would not move against them. Muyiwa Adejobi, Police Public Relations Officer, gave the assurance in a statement on Friday. He quoted the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, as appealing to all protesters “to maintain law and order while they embark on peaceful protests.” Odumosu said the Police, “will do everything possible not to infringe on their rights”. Lagosians, including celebrities, have been marching against the activities of the controversial unit. In Delta State, a policeman died in a similar protest. The Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered the arrest and prosecution of the culprits.

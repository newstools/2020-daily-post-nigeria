The apex Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has lauded the Federal Government for the new salary structure for teachers, noting that their reward should no longer be in heaven. The group noted that workers are now better off but lamented that some states still owe workers’ salary arrears and pensions, especially some Igbo states. Ohanaeze called on South-East Governors to look into the matter, asserting that a worker deserves his or her wages. The socio-cultural organization made the commendation in a press release made available to newsmen, by its spokesman, Chuks Ibegbu, on Friday. DAILY POST recalls that President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday approved a special salary scale for teachers in the country. Recall that a new teachers’ salary structure was announced by the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, during the 2020 World Teachers Day celebration. However, Ohanaeze further lauded the federal government for reviving of the Onitsha inland port, calling for it to be permanent and not just a one time show. It called on the federal government to dredge the Imo river to the Atlantic and site inland ports at Azumini and Akwette and also build a federal university of international languages and business at Aba to replace the National Institute of Nigerian languages at Aba now underfunded. OYC called for the creation of additional state and local governments in the South-East zone as a matter of urgency and without further delay to check the current shortchanging of the region. It asked for the dualisation of the Enugu-Makurdi and Enugu-Lokoja federal highway and resuscitation of the Port-Harcourt-Maiduguri rail line.

Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, has said that the Blues’ 2012 UEFA Champions League final victory against Bayern Munich in Germany was one of the best moments of his career. Drogba stated this at the UEFA Best Award and Champions League group stage draw which was held on Thursday evening in Geneva, Switzerland. The Ivory Coast legend was joined by his former Chelsea team-mate Florent Malouda as he received the UEFA President’s Award and the duo shared memories of their crowning moment with Chelsea against Bayern. “I think it’s one of the best moments in my career, if not the best,” Drogba, who scored Chelsea’s late equaliser and the winner in the shoot-out in that final against Bayern said. “I had a manager when I was in Le Mans who told me “you don’t need to play 90 minutes, 10 minutes is enough for you to make the difference”. “At first, I was frustrated, but I learned how to use those 10 minutes and be efficient. So all those goals in the last minutes, I think it is also because of this lesson.” Also reacting, Malouda, who was one of the players making his last Chelsea appearance that night against Bayern Munich, added: “It was I think the greatest achievement of our life. We would have been chasing that trophy for so long. “We were close in Moscow, it was four years earlier with a lot of drama as well, penalty kicks. “That time for this squad, it was a very emotional night, because we knew after that everyone would go their separate ways, but we knew we did something great and we celebrated as much as we could. We enjoyed it!”.

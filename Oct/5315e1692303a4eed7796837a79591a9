For me, that is one aspect of monumental problems we have in our land. End SARS means end injustice, end oppression, end subjugation, end poverty, end hunger, end nepotism, bigotry; it means end every evil in the nation. We are doing that the same time because this time calls for aggressive spiritual intervention. “I think that when people are pushed to the wall, they react, and that is what I think the youths are doing. It is not SARS issue but general wahala. “I, therefore, call on the relevant authorities to find an immediate solution. Open your ears to what is happening and take action to arrest the situation immediately. It is not the time to play the ostrich. It is not the time to bully anybody. It is time to admit that something is wrong and something must be done and it must be done urgently.” Youths have been protesting against police brutality and leadership failure in the country.

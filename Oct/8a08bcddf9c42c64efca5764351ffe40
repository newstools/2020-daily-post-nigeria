A former Manchester United star, Dimitar Berbatov has backed the team in its battle to draw against Tottenham on Sunday. United have not had a smooth start to the new season and needed a contentious penalty to beat Brighton last weekend. Berbatov reckons United will earn a share of the spoils against Jose Mourinho’s side. He told the Metro: “I think this will end up a draw. Both teams are up and down, they have very good strengths and very bad weaknesses. “I hope it’s not 0-0 and the football is good, but they are evenly matched.” For the game between Manchester City and Leeds United, Berbatov said he would not be shocked to see an upset. “I think City will ultimately just have too much quality and win, but Leeds will not lie down,” he added. He tipped Liverpool to continue their 100 per cent start with a 3-0 win at undefeated Aston Villa.

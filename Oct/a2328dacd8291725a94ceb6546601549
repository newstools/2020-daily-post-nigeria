The National Youth Service Corps on Tuesday announced that 43 hoodlums, who invaded its Abuja camp, have been arrested and some of the stolen items recovered. Recall that some hoodlums on Tuesday had stormed the NYSC Orientation camp located in Kubwa, Bwari Local Government Area Council, to loot food, kits and other camp items they believed were kept in the stores. Speaking on the incident, NYSC DG, Shuaibu Ibrahim said, “They came in at 7 a.m. and burgled the store where the FCT administration kept palliatives for COVID-19 victims, but found the store empty as everything was distributed since July. “We told them that we do not have anything left. But when that first group left, another group came and burgled other stores in camp where our NYSC kits are kept. “They took the NYSC kits comprising hats, caps and boots. They also took plastic chairs, mattresses, freezers and drums used to barricade the gate. “The hoodlums proceeded to the NYSC coordinator’s residence, broke the wall, removed television sets, air conditioners, freezers, among other items” NAN quoted him as saying. The DG, while appealing to Nigerians to respect the NYSC camps, confirmed that some of the items had been recovered from the communities around the camp.

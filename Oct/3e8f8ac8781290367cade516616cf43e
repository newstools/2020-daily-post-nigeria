Thousands of young people taking part in the End SARS protest in Anambra State have headed to the SARS command headquarters in Awkuzu. The protesters who converged on Ekwueme Square in Awka with popular musician, Flavour leading the campaign seized the expressway, causing a heavy traffic gridlock in the town. Though the distance from Awka to Awkuzu is about 25 kilometers, the protesters insisted on getting to the once dreaded command headquarters, to ensure that operatives have truly vacated the area. As at the time of filing this report, the protesters are still on their way. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-849123 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FB_IMG_1602853914833.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="640" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FB_IMG_1602853914833.jpg 480w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FB_IMG_1602853914833-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-849124 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FB_IMG_1602853921829.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FB_IMG_1602853921829.jpg 480w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FB_IMG_1602853921829-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-849125 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FB_IMG_1602853932489.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FB_IMG_1602853932489.jpg 480w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FB_IMG_1602853932489-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px">

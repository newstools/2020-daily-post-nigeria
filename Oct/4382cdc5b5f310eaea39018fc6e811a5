The Department of State Services (DSS) has debunked the rumour circulating on social media that its personnel are aiding pro-SARS supporters and thugs to attack #ENDSARS protesters in Abuja. The security agency asserted that none of its personnel has, so far, been identified to be involved in the alleged acts. The Public Relations Officer, Peter Afunanya, in a statement on Tuesday, said part of the untruth being spewed to the public was that some of its officials attached to certain VIPs aided thugs in this regard. Afunanya described the allegations levelled against DSS as untrue, which can only be taken as false narratives designed to cast it in the bad image, as well as inflame the protests. “The Service is a responsible professional Organization and will endeavour to remain so at all times,” he said. According to the service, “It begs the question to conclude that SUVs and persons dressed in suits and sighted in conflict environments are of the DSS. Fact is that no staff of the DSS will engage in acts as the ones being peddled by these rumour mongers and hate speakers. “It, therefore, wishes to state that the allegations levelled against it are not true and can only be taken as false narratives designed to cast it in the bad image as well as inflame the protests.” “Consequently, the public is enjoined to disregard the falsehood emanating from sections of the social and mainstream media, subversive groups and interests. The Service uses this opportunity to call on citizens to eschew bitterness, remain law-abiding and cooperate with security agencies and indeed, the Government for lasting peace and public safety,” he said.

President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has announced that he is leaving the hospital where he is undergoing treatment for COVID-19. The President said he now feels better “than I did 20 years ago.” Recall that Trump and his wife tested positive for COVID-19 late last week. Trump said on Monday evening that he is ready to leave the Walter Reed Medical Centre, urging Americans not to be afraid of coronavirus. Trump tweeted, “I will be leaving the great Walter Reed Medical Center today at 6:30 P.M. Feeling really good! Don’t be afraid of COVID. “Don’t let it dominate your life. We have developed, under the Trump Administration, some really great drugs and knowledge. I feel better than I did 20 years ago!”

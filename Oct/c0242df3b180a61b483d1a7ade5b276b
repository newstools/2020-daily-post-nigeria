Bauchi State Commissioner of Police, Lawan Tanko Jimeta, on Wednesday, directed the anti-riot commanders in the state to ensure compliance with the directive on deployment of anti-riot policemen as given by the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar Adamu. This is even as Jimeta ordered the commanders to warn their men to be firm and professional while discharging their duty. A press release signed by the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Mohammed Ahmed Wakil and made available to DAILY POST in Bauchi, informed that the commissioner’s instruction is in line with IGP Adamu’s directives on the deployment of anti-riot officers to protect lives and properties, critical infrastructure nationwide. According to the police spokesman, Jimeta charged all area commanders and Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) to be at alert and ensure frequent supervision of their men. “In view of the increasing attacks and malicious damage to public and private facilities as recorded in some states, the CP charged all the area commanders/Divisional Police Officers(DPOs) to be at alert and ensure frequent supervision of men under their jurisdiction,” he stated. He, however, stated that Jimeta called on the public, particularly protesters, to exercise restraint and allow measures being put in place to materialise. “While reaffirming his irrevocable commitment towards the successful and holistic implementation of the police reforms by the police management team, CP Jimeta enjoins members of the public, particularly protesting citizens to exercise restraint and allow measures being put in place to come to fruition and engender a police force that would meet the yearnings and aspirations of the citizenry.” DSP Wakil reassured members of the public that the Bauchi State Police Command is committed to protecting lives and livelihood. While seeking the support of religious leaders, youth leaders, and civil society organizations in the state, the PPRO advised parents/guardians to caution their wards to steer clear of acts of violence and criminality, warning that the command will not hesitate to mobilize all resources within its power to confront and neutralize their criminal acts and tendencies.

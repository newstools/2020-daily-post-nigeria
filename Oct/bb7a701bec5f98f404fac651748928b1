The Commissioner of Police in Abia State, Janet Agbede has dispelled rumours that Fulanis were grouping to launch an attack in Abia State . Speaking to newsmen during a press conference in Umuahia, on Thursday, Agbede described the rumour as false. According to the Abia Police Commissioner “this rumour is not only false but the Handwork of those intending to cause more tension and confusion across the state. I wish to reassure the law-abiding citizens and residents in the state to go about their lawful businesses as the law enforcement agencies are ever ready to protect their lives and properties”. CP Agbede, however, called out hoodlums who took advantage of the End SARS protest in the state to loot public and private properties to return them or be ready to face the full wrath of the law.

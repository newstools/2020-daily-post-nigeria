Music superstar, Kanye West, has added his voice to End SARS calls. Kanye declared his position on Monday via Twitter. The fashion mogul urged authorities to listen to the people. “I stand with my Nigerian brothers and sisters to end police brutality, the government must answer to the people’s cries #EndPoliceBrutalityinNigeria”, he tweeted. The campaign against the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) has attracted global sympathies. Organisations including Black Lives Matter, and several international celebrities have shown solidarity with Nigerians. The Police have announced scrapping of the unit but protesters insist their demands have not been met. They want a thorough investigation and prosecution of all officers found culpable of murders and assaults. Ongoing protests have left at least 6 people dead, scores wounded and some in critical condition.

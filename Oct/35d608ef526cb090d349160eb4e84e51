Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, has revealed that Barcelona lost 3-1 against his team because his players defended compactly and attacked with space against Ronald Koeman’s side. Real Madrid defeated Barcelona at Camp Nou, thanks to three goals from Federico Valverde, Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric. Ansu Fati did score a goal for Barcelona as Zidane’s men took all three points against the host. “After the criticism we received, we had to stay calm and united,” Zidane told a post-match press conference after the game. “Play when we had to play, and play the way we did today.” Zidane added: “I don’t know if [the criticism towards us] was fair or not. “What I can say is that I’m proud of my team. We have done it against a team that always causes you problems. “We had to [call on Thibaut] Courtois twice, but we also had chances to score four goals. In the end, I’m happy at getting three points here. “We have to enjoy it after all the comments that were made about us. We’re not here to shut people up. We’re here to do it our way and to believe in what we do. “That’s what we’ve done. I’m very proud of what we’ve done, defending compactly and then attacking with space. “We deserve our victory because we finished 1-3, we were able to score more. We have to think about our deserved victory.”

The Kwara State chapter of the Nigerian Institute of Public Relations, NIPR, on Wednesday, called on the state government and the labour unions in the state to pave way for meaningful dialogue aimed at amicable resolution of the ongoing strike in the state. Reacting to the ongoing industrial action which entered its second day on Wednesday, over the failure to implement the N30,000 minimum wage, the institute blamed the current development on breakdown in communication between the two parties. A statement by the state Chairman and General Secretary of the institute, Dr Saudat Salah Abdulbaqi and Abdulrahman Sanni, respectively called “On the state government to be sincere in opening its book to restore public trust.” It also appealed to the organised labour unions to demonstrate the spirit of give and take in finding enduring solution to the problem. The NIPR, said, ” as part of its corporate social responsibility, it is expedient for the institute, to call for sincerity of purpose among the two parties to restore industrial harmony in the state.” The institute further enjoined, “the state government to always be proactive, in the implementation of its programmes and policies through constant engagement of all critical stakeholders to ensure inclusive governance,” which it described as the hallmark of standard democracies across the globe. “No meaningful development could be attained in an atmosphere of rancour and acrimony,” the institute noted, urging critical stakeholders in the state to urgently Wade in to restore industrial harmony in the state. DAILY POST reports that the state labour movement commenced an indefinite industrial strike action on Tuesday, despite a court order restraining the action, to pressure the state government to sign and implement the N30,000 minimum wage for state and local government councils workers.

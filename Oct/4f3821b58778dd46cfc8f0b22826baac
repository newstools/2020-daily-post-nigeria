Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi has said that foreign-based footballers are scared of visiting Nigeria over the alleged killings by suspected operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). Ndidi made this claim in a tweet on Saturday. The Super Eagles midfielder lamented that many Nigerian youths are being killed by those expected to protect them. Ndidi wrote: “End SARS for the safety of Nigerians. We are scared to visit home because the people who are meant to protect us are killing us. “Looking good with dreads is not a crime.” Other national team stars like Leon Balogun, Shehu Abdulahi and John Ogu had joined the call for SARS to be disbanded.

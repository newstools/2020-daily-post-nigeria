Hoodlums on Thursday destroyed and looted medical equipment belonging to the Abia State Dental Center and the Primary Health Authority Office in Aba, Aba South Local Government Area of the state Medical disposables and consumables were among items looted. The items include Vaccines, X-ray machines, Sterilisers, Air conditioners and fans. The attack was carried out by hoodlums who hijacked the otherwise peaceful End SARS protests. The state government has, however, appealed to those who looted the items to return them to designated government offices or call the Special Adviser to the Governor on Health Matters, Mr Joe Chinwendu. The government warned members of the public not to buy or use any of the stolen items or procure such items from unauthorised persons to avoid getting into trouble with the law. The warning was contained in a release issued by the State Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu, in Umuahia, on Friday. “Kindly note that most of the Primary Health Care and Dental equipment are trackable and will certainly be recovered in due course if not voluntarily returned”.

Atletico Madrid striker, Luis Suarez, has promised not to celebrate if he scores against Barcelona. Suarez swapped the Nou Camp for Wanda Metropolitano this summer after six years. The 33-year-old was informed by Barca that he was surplus to requirements and was forced to leave. Suarez nearly signed for Juventus, before eventually joining Atletico in a €6million transfer. The Uruguay striker will face Barca on November 22 and when asked if he would celebrate a goal if he scored, Suarez told ESPN: “If I scored against Barcelona, I would not yell or go crazy, but I surely would point somewhere.” Suarez has already scored twice in three appearances for Diego Simeone’s men.

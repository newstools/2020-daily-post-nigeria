Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has said his government on Monday deliberately gave out COVID-19 relief packages to some Sagamu youths, who he said they were angry as a result of hunger. Gov Abiodun’s comment was a reaction to videos circulating on the social media wherein it was seen that some suspected COVID-19 palliatives warehouses were looted in Sagamu, Ifo and Ijebu-Ode. The Governor, while addressing a press conference at Okemosan, Abeokuta this evening, said “none of our COVID-19 warehouses were looted.” Abiodun said he was not aware of any looting incident in Sagamu. According to him, “We intentionally decided that as part of our continuous engagement with our youths across the state, in Sagamu local government, we made available some palliatives for the youth, knowing fully well that a lot has been happening across the rest of the country. We appreciate the fact that these are very difficult and trying times. “There’s a lot of anger derived from hunger and the pandemic has not helped them. It is time we all appreciate that things are a bit tough,” Abiodun stated. The Ogun Governor denied stockpiling the COVID-19 palliatives, saying the story was a narrative by a few to malign and paint Governors of different states bad.

Following the killing of protesters at the Lagos tollgate by security operatives, the senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa on Wednesday told president Muhammadu Buhari and other politicians to prepare to face God’s wrath. Reacting in a statement to DAILY POST on Wednesday, Giwa said the blood of innocent Nigerians murdered by the Nigerian Army and other security men would haunt their generation forever. He said,” Without an order, a soldier cannot shoot. The order must have come from the top. But, hear this as God liveth, anybody who had hands in the death of those killed shall not live to witness more years ahead. “The blood of the innocent Nigerians murdered so far will haunt their generation. What a sheer wickedness, how could you kill the unarmed protesters ? “There wouldn’t have been protest if things are going too well in Nigeria. What stops President Buhari from listening to Nigerians? “You dare not face members of the Boko Haram, but you can kill the citizens unarmed. Haa, it shall never be well with the present political leaders in Nigeria. “The APC and President Buhari didn’t promise to kill Nigerians when they voted for them. They didn’t promise to shorten the lives of our children. “What manner of a president are you? Nigerians won’t forget the APC, we shall never forget president Muhammadu Buhari.”

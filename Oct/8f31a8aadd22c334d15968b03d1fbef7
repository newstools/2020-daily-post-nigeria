Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) has removed its Deputy National President, Mohammed Soba, from office. He is the Chairman of Soba Local Government in Kaduna State. ALGON spokesman, Obiora Orji, in a statement on Thursday, said Jega Shehu has been appointed to the position. He said Soba was unanimously sacked by the National Executive Council (NEC) and the Board of Trustees (BOT) at a meeting Wednesday night in Asaba, Delta State. Soba was removed for “conduct against the constitutional provisions of ALGON”. Orji disclosed that the motion for his removal was raised by ALGON Chairman in Nasarawa State, Aminu Maifata. Maifata is the Chairman of Lafia Local Government Area. The motion was seconded by Delta State representative, Ikpokpo Malik, and ALGON Chairman in Sokoto State, Aminu Ibrahim. Reacting, Sabo told NAN that he was not aware of the development. He called it illegal and that the officials had no powers to take such action. “I was elected and if I must be removed, the right procedures must be followed as stated in the association’s constitution. For somebody to summon a purported NEC meeting to remove me, there must be a reason for that and I am not aware. “Before a removal,there must be a ground for fair hearing. If there is any allegation or accusation to my person or my office, they could have informed me and I will answer it,” Soba said.

Arsenal paid Mesut Ozil a loyalty bonus amounting to £8million at the end of September, the Athletic reports. This comes despite the player not featuring for the Gunners since March this year. Ozil signed a new deal in January 2018 until the summer of 2021, making him the club’s highest earner on £350,000-a-week. It has now emerged the deal included a huge loyalty bonus, in a bid to convince him to stay for the entirety of the contract. Despite being left out of the side by manager Mikel Arteta and dropped from Arsenal’s Europa League squad last week, Ozil has picked up the big cheue for staying put. Arsenal were keen to try and offload the 31-year-old, but he has remained adamant he will see out his contract.

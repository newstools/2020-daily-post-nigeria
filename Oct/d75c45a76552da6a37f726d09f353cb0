Dino Melaye, former Kogi West Senator, has advised the Federal Government to work with protesting Nigerians or face revolution. Melaye gave the advice while stressing that the government had no constitutional powers to ban protest. The former lawmaker said the anti-police protest was an indication that Nigerians had woken up from their slumber. In a tweet, Melaye wrote: “Government has no power in our extant laws to ban protests. “So, the Government must realise that the people have woken up from their slumber. Work with the people or welcome a REVOLUTION. SDM.“ The continued protest against police brutality by aggrieved Nigerian youths has led to the dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, unit of the Nigeria Police Force, NPF. Following the dissolution of SARS, the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu had established the Special Weapon and Tactics Team, SWAT.

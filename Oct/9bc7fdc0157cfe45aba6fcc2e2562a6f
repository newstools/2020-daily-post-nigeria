Nigerian rapper, Ruggedman, has reacted to the ban of the personnel of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Abubakar Adamu, in a press release on Sunday banned the personnel of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) from patrols and stop-search duties with immediate effect following alleged killings and harassment of youths. Reacting, Ruggedman urged Adamu to take action and not talk. According to him, some police officers don’t obey the IGP or any Nigerian law. “We have read this before. Some of your officers do not obey you or any Nigerian law,” he wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “We have pictures, videos, names & addresses of rogue officers and their victims. Deal with erring officers. “They are everywhere committing more crimes against Nigeria. Take action, not talk,” he added. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-845574" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ruggedman.jpg" alt="" width="595" height="494" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ruggedman.jpg 595w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ruggedman-300x249.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px">

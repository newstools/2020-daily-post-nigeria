Dembele had drawn the interest of Man United in the past.      , Pogba and Dembele are both international teammates with the France national team. The 27-year-old has personally called Dembele in an attempt to persuade him to make a move to Man United before the transfer window closes later this month. He supports Man United’s push to sign the 23-year-old and believes the winger could become a key part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. Meanwhile, asked about the rumours surrounding Dembele’s future amid interest from Man United, Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman told reporters before his side’s La Liga 3-0 victory against Celta Vigo on Thursday that he trusts the player. “Dembele’s situation? I’m counting on him. “He was very good in the first weeks [of pre-season], but he had a downturn last week. “I am counting on him. But these are decisions for the club and the player.” Dembele joined Barcelona from Borussia Dortmund in a £135.5m deal in 2017.

The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has urged the Federal Government to lead the way in restoring peace and justice in Nigeria. ASUU also said that security operatives must be stopped from the senseless killing of armless youth protesters, while infiltrators must be brought under check through active intelligence. The union said this in a statement posted on its Twitter handle on Friday while condemning the shooting of Nigerian youths by soldiers at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos State. The statement read in part: “The Federal Government must lead the way in restoring peace and justice in Nigeria. Security operatives must be stopped from the senseless killing of armless youth protesters while infiltrators must be brought under check through active intelligence. “For obvious reasons of past betrayal, the youth are right to insist on seeing evidence of how well the government has met their five-point demand. It is only by the continuous engagement that this would happen, not by the deployment of trigger-happy military personnel as reportedly done in the case of the Lekki Toll Plaza.” Meanwhile, the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has provided details of the investigation to the Lekki toll gate shooting. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-851452" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-2.jpg" alt="" width="382" height="680" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-2.jpg 382w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-2-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 382px) 100vw, 382px"> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-851453" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-1.jpg" alt="" width="607" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-1.jpg 607w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-1-169x300.jpg 169w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-1-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px"> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-851451" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-3.jpg" alt="" width="607" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-3.jpg 607w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-3-169x300.jpg 169w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Asuu-3-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px">

The National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has insisted there is no official date for the reopening of camps. This was contained in a statement signed by the NYSC’s Director of Press and Public Relations, Adenike Adeyemi, in Abuja on Saturday. Adeyemi described reports that the orientation course will resume October 27, 2020 as fake. “It is imperative to state that the Scheme has ensured that all the COVID-19 safety protocols incidental to safe hosting of Orientation programmes are in place in all its 37 Orientation Camps. “Note also that some precautionary safety measures already adopted by the Scheme had earned it the commendation of the PTF,” the statement read. The NYSC expressed hope the Federal Government will soon give approval for the full resumption of camping. “While the NYSC sincerely appreciates the patience so far shown by the PCMs who have waited for over six months to be called-up for participation in the Scheme, it equally empathises with them over the unanticipated disruption of their programmes, resulting from COVID-19 pandemic,” it added.

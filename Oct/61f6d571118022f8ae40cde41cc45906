Gift Camille, the girlfriend of Sanni Goriola Wasiu aka Lil Frosh, has spoken about the abuse she suffered. In a statement posted on her social media accounts, the victim narrated how the violence started. She recalled how Lil Frosh hit her at different times, damaged her phone and recorded her naked. The model revealed that the embattled artist threatened to publicize the video. Gift wrote: “@lhilfrosh and I have been dating for almost 10 months now and he has been abusing me physically, mentally and emotionally. At first, I sincerely hoped he was going to change but he didn’t. It started with stripping me off my friends, telling me who to talk and who not to talk to. “It grew to him beating me each time we had an argument. He’ll beat me, smash my phone, destroy my ring light, pour me water, even film me naked and threaten to post. He has done that right in front of @okikidft and it continued. This happened 15th of September, that led to the internal bleeding in my head, confirmed by the doctors. “My manager spoke on my behalf with my permission and he is not to be blamed for anything. He didn’t beg me to go and meet him, no one did, not even my family. Everyone advised me but I still did what I wanted hoping for change. My family has been doing their best to get me in the best space and best health.” Gift thanked everyone that has supported and reached out to her. “I’m getting better now…Justice must be served”, she added. On Tuesday, David Adeleke aka Davido dropped Lil Frosh from his label, DMW.

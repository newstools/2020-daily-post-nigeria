Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, has faulted the disbandment of the Special Anti Robbery Squad, SARS, by the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu. The BNYL said it was in total support of the calls by some Northern groups for transfer of SARS to the North. National Leader of BNYL, Princewill Chimezie Richard, in a statement to DAILY POST on Sunday, said that the Inspector General would be appreciated if he had deployed SARS to Borno to fight the Boko Haram instead of scrapping the unit. “Transferring SARS to the North especially Borno would have been the best decision to take, they needed to engage Boko Haram, only then they will understand that Kaki No Be Leather”. BNYL said the End SARS protest is not the solution to police brutality, adding that the military has abandoned its external duty and now does the work of the police. The Biafra group said Nigerians should drop the End SARS protest and begin to demonstrate for the end of Nigeria. “It will be more sensible Nigerians start to demonstrate for #EndNigeria and not End SARS.”

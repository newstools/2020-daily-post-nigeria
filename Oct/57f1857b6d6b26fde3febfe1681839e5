Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has ordered security operatives deployed to enforce curfew not to shoot the crowd that broke into some warehouses to take foodstuff meant for distribution as palliatives. The Special Adviser, Media and Publicity to the Governor, Christian Ita in press release issued Friday night said “The state governor, His Excellency Sir Ben Ayade has directed security agents mobilized to different locations in Calabar not to shoot at crowds that broke into some warehouses to take foodstuff meant for distribution as palliatives. “The foodstuffs were taken delivery of about two weeks ago with distribution ongoing, especially in the rural areas. The governor is sad at the ugly turn of events following the hijacking of the peaceful protest against police brutality in the state. “While urging security agents to apply the utmost restraint in trying to enforce peace, they should do so without shooting at any one. He appealed to everyone to give peace a chance as government works hard to meet the demands of the young people,” the release added

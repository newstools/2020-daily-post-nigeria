Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu, has declared that Nigeria is already no more. According to Kanu, the country ended when it was allegedly restructured to the advantage of one part. Nigeria is celebrating her 60th Independence Day today, October 1, 2020. And in a tweet, the UK-based secessionist leader, said, “Nigeria ENDED when it was unilaterally restructured to the oppressive advantage of one part of the many parts that founded Nigeria.” He called on those from the areas he described as the disadvantaged parts to join the ongoing sit-at-home in some parts of the country. “If you’re from the parts that got disadvantaged, #SitAtHomeOnOct1st to tell them that you no longer wish to be a slave to #Fulani irredentism. “

Former Manchester United midfielder, Owen Hargreaves, has urged the club to sign a “few players” before the transfer window closes next week. Owen made the appeal while reacting to Man United’s UEFA Champions League group stage draw on Thursday. Man United regained a place in Europe’s top-flight competition after finishing third in the Premier League last season. The Red Devils were drawn in Group H with Paris Saint-Germain, RB Leipzig and Istanbul Basaksehir. “I think they [Man United] can be quietly confident,” Owen said on BT Sport. “PSG are the strongest team in the group H, but I think United are the second strongest team. “RB Leipzig have a brilliant young manager who will relish playing against United. We know that they’re not firing on all cylinders, but hopefully, they get a few players in. It’s a big season for United and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. “[The draw] is not ideal but hopefully they can get a few players in and finish first or second.”

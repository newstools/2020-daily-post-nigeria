Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said the club is still in the market for players. There are less than 24 hours left to the end of this transfer window. Arteta has only brought in Willian from Chelsea on a free transfer and Gabriel Magalhaes from Lille. The Gunners were keen on Lyon’s Houssem Aouar, but the deal now appears dead in the water, as the player now wants to remain in France. Speaking to the media after a 2-1 win over Sheffield United, Arteta insisted the club was working on deals. “e know exactly what we want to do and we’re trying our best to finalise the deals we want. “Believe me, believe me. The ownership, the board, Edu and myself are doing everything we can. “I have 100 per cent backing from them. It is not just words, it is reality.”

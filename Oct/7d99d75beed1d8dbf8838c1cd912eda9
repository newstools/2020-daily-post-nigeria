Deputy Minority Leader, Gombe State House of Assembly, Rambi Ayala, has resigned his membership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Ayala represents the Billiri East constituency. He made the pronouncement on Tuesday after a Gombe High Court dismissed his application that sought the declaration of his suspension by the PDP illegal. The Speaker, Abubakar Ibrahim and his deputy Siddi Buba (both of the ruling APC in the state) were in court with Ayala. Ayala explained that his decision was a result of the undemocratic nature of the party. “Take note that I hereby resign my membership of this party (PDP). Sadly, the party has become grossly and bitterly divided and dangerously lawless,’’ NAN quoted him as saying. The lawmaker said he was not satisfied with the way PDP treated him. Ayala recalled that he was suspended on July 28 without a fair hearing. He lamented that the PDP did not invite him to appear before a disciplinary committee. Chairman, Billiri South, ward of PDP, Lewi Jinjiri, noted that Ayala exercised his right. “We have nothing to do because it’s his choice”, he said.

Big Brother Naija reality star, Nengi has revealed that a reconciliation move with her boyfriend after her eviction failed. The beauty queen who said her relationship with her boyfriend of almost two years ended because she told him she was going for the reality show, gave the update on Thursday. In an interview during her media rounds, Nengi said it seemed like her boyfriend has moved on because he has refused to pick her call. She said, “I have been trying to reach him but he has refused to pick my call. “I think he has broken up with me or he is still angry.” Recall that Nengi had said she did not pursue a relationship with Ozo because of her situation with her boyfriend. She, however, promised that time will tell if she would date Ozo.

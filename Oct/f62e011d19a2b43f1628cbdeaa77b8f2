Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest injury update on Thiago Silva and Kepa Arrizabalaga ahead of his side’s away Premier League clash with Burnley at Turf Moor on Saturday evening. Thiago and Kepa missed Chelsea’s Champions League 4-0 victory against Krasnodar in Russia on Wednesday night due to injury. But Lampard is now saying that Thiago is fit to feature against Burnley, while Kepa is still recovering from a shoulder injury. “Thiago is fit,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying at his pre-match press conference. “Taking him out of the trip to Russia was more of a maintenance issue for him, and I spoke to him about it. “We are just trying to make sure we get the best out of him over the course of a season, and in this schedule where we have game after game after game, it made sense [for him not to be involved] in a game which involved a lot of travelling. Lampard added: “Kepa is outside as I speak and has had some progression in his shoulder injury, so we are hopeful, but we will see with that one. “In terms of the rest of the squad, we don’t have any clear injuries, but we do have a bit of a tired group.”

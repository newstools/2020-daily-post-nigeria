United States President, Donald Trump, on Thursday, said he was feeling perfect. Trump tested positive to COVID-19 last week. The announcement was made after his debate with Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. The American leader returned to the White House on Monday, after a three-day hospitalisation. In a chat with Fox Business, Trump expressed readiness to hit the campaign trail. “I think I’m better … to a point where I’d love to do a rally tonight. I wanted to do one last night. I feel perfect. There’s nothing wrong,” the president assured. Trump, however, declared that he would not participate in a virtual debate with Biden. “I’m not going to waste my time with a virtual debate. That’s not what debating is all about. You sit behind a computer and do a debate, that is ridiculous,” he fumed. The organizers, Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD), on Thursday said that the second Trump-Biden encounter will see candidates “participate from separate remote locations.” The next debate is scheduled for October 15.

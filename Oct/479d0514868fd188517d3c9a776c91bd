The Police Command in Ogun State has arrested no fewer than 23 members of End SARS protesters. Police said they were taken into custody on Saturday when their demonstration turned violent. Abimbola Oyeyemi, Police Public Relations Officer, in a statement, said the protesters gathered in the morning at Panseke area of Abeokuta. He said this was despite the advice by the Police and other stakeholders for cancellation of the protest to avoid being hijacked by miscreants. The spokesman noted that the Alake of Egbaland and Commissioner of Police jointly appealed to them. He regretted that they left the Alake’s palace and headed the Palace of Olowu where the Owu Day traditional festival was going on. “They violently disrupted the ceremony which had former president, Olusegun Obasanjo and Deputy Governor, Noimot Salako in attendance. They damaged the back windshield of the deputy governor’s official car before heading to SARS office at magbon where they fired some gunshots at the men and injured one Sgt Akabudike Augustine. “Consequently, men of the outfit dispersed them and subsequently arrested 23. Some of their vehicles abandoned at SARS office were recovered and searched. One pump action, two locally made pistols, some rounds of ammunition and assorted charms were recovered in one of the vehicles with registration number Lagos KRD 551GJ.” The statement appealed to parents, community leaders and other stakeholders to call their wards to order. It warned that the command will not fold its arms “while hoodlums unleash violence on officers and men for just no reason”.

Armed thugs on Wednesday attacked End SARS protesters at Berger area of Abuja. The thugs who invaded the protest venue at Berger junction were armed with cutlasses. They chased the protesters, and destroyed vehicles parked in the area. DAILY POST gathered that some protesters sustained injuries and have been rushed to the hospital. Meanwhile, the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, on Tuesday set up a new unit to replace the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) Team will “fill the gaps” arising from the dissolution of SARS. But, despite the announcement, protests are still ongoing in different states.

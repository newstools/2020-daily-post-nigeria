A University Don, Professor Solomon Bewaji, has described the violence that followed the End SARS protest nationwide, as an indication that criminals have declared war on Nigeria. Prof. Bewaji, who is of the Department of History, University of Ilorin, lamented that criminals have taken over the protests and have declared war on ordinary citizens of the country. Speaking with journalists in UNILORIN, the Don said, the protesters have shown no empathy to the masses who are bearing the brunt of their actions. The Don said the refusal of protesters to end their demonstration after President Muhammadu Buhari’s apology led to hoodlums taking advantage of the situation. He said: “Otherwise, how do you explain a situation where on the very first day that the protesters came out, they were carrying food in take away packs and distributing assorted drinks not just to themselves but to security agents on patrol. “Ordinarily, they would have discontinued the protests the moment the President disbanded the SARS and the Vice President apologised, but because they want to create a window for criminals to take over, they refused to leave the streets. “Now the criminals have taken over and they have started burning public buildings, attacking innocent people and have ushered in an atmosphere of mayhem and commotion all against the masses of this country.” There have been reports of hoodlums hijacking the peaceful protest across the country. In Lagos State, TVC news station, The Nation, Channels television, police stations were burnt down by hoodlums. While in Benin City, Edo State, hoodlums attacked Nigerian Correctional Centres, where they released several inmates.

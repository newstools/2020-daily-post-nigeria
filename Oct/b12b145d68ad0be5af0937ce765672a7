Femi Adesina, Spokesman to President Muhammadu Buhari, has said that his principal did not miss anything in his (Buhari) nationwide broadcast on Thursday. Adesina insisted that the Lekki shooting was contained in Buhari’s broadcast. Adesina said this when he appeared on Channels Television on Friday evening, adding that former President Olusegun Obasanjo commend Buhari during the meeting with ex-Heads of State today. He pointed out that the president’s message to the international community was on Lekki shooting, contrary to the belief that Buhari did not talk about the tragic incident in Lagos. “It was not omitted. That message to the international community was on Lekki shooting,” the presidential spokesman insisted. “It is not true. Somewhere in that speech, the President spoke to the international community. He thanked those who had sought understanding before they made comments. “He was also telling those who were hasty in their judgement to seek more information. He didn’t miss out on anything.” President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday addressed Nigerians following the escalation of the End SARS crisis in many States in the country. However, the President’s speech received a wide range of criticism as many people lacked the needed ingredients to calm the tension in the land.

Itanola Abdulsamad, an internet fraud suspect, on Tuesday, changed his earlier plea of guilty to not guilty. Abdulsamad, 21, and a student of the University of Ilorin was re-arraigned by the Ilorin Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, before a Kwara State high court, presided over by Justice Sikiru Oyinloye, on a four-count charge bordering on internet fraud and other related offences. Count two of the charge sheet read; “That you, Itanola Abdulsamad, Popoola Afolami (now at large), sometime between 2018 and 2019, at Ilorin within the judicial division of the Kwara state high court, fraudulently induced several unsuspecting foreigners vide the internet to deliver to you, digital currency from which you benefitted 950 dollars and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 321 of the Penal code and punishable under Section 324 of the same Penal code.” At the resumed hearing of the case on Tuesday, counsel to the defendant, Adewale Olatunde, told the judge, “My Lord, my client has informed me that he wants to change his plea from guilty to not guilty. “I humbly urge your Lordship to allow the charge be read to the defendant for him to change his plea,” the counsel pleaded. However, Justice Oyinloye adjourned the case till October 29,2020, for the prosecution to open its case against the defendant.

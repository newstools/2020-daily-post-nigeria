Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has taken a fresh swipe at Jose Mourinho, after their angry touchline row this week. Mourinho took aim at Lampard during their Carabao Cup clash on Thursday. The Tottenham Hotspur boss shouted “f****** hell Frank, when you’re losing 3-0 you’re not standing up here,” as the pair exchanged words. Both managers played down the incident after the match and insisted their mutual respect remains intact, with Mourinho claiming he was giving his former midfielder advice. But, asked if he could take the advice offered by Mourinho, Lampard said: “I don’t think any remarks made on the touchline during the game can be called advice. “They can probably be wrapped up as advice after a game when you manage to get back in the game and win on penalties, so I don’t think that is the case. “I would always be happy to not just take advice from fellow managers, but everything around me whether it be my players, staff, people I respect, listen to in football outside football, in life. “I think that’s what moulds you as a manager so I don’t think the Jose incident was ever advice. It wasn’t that.”

There is palpable tension amongst security agencies in Osun State, as operative of the Department of State Services (DSS), identified as Seyi Adebowale, was allegedly shot dead by one Sunday Dada, an official of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). The unfortunate incident, according to a reliable source, happened at Kuta, in Ayedire Local Government Area of the state, during a function at the palace of Olowu Kuta, the traditional ruler of the town on Tuesday, September 15. A community leader in Kuta, who confided in DAILY POST correspondent, revealed that Dada and his colleague, who were attached to the palace were shooting indiscriminately in a celebratory mood when a stray bullet hit the DSS officer. Dada was later arrested by operatives of DSS and was released to the NSCDC, Osun Command, after a week in their custody. An eyewitness told our correspondent that some of the DSS operatives, who were deployed to the palace to maintain security at the function had earlier warned the NSCDC officers over the shooting. Meanwhile, further findings revealed that Seyi was rushed to Iwo general hospital, where he was first stabilised and later moved to LAUTECH Teaching hospital in Osogbo, for further treatment.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-845361" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSS-officer-in-Uniform.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="894" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSS-officer-in-Uniform.jpg 214w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/DSS-officer-in-Uniform-72x300.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px"> A source in the hospital told our correspondent that the DSS officer was first rejected by one Dr. Ayeyemi, at the Accident and Emergency Unit of the hospital, due to insufficient space, but was later admitted after DSS officers who rushed Seyi to the hospital became forceful. He was later stabilised and subsequently operated by one doctor, who was simply identified as Dr Ashafa for two hours on Wednesday, September 17, after which he started responding to further treatment. However, Seyi started having swell stomach after some days, and his health started deteriorating, which prompted a liaison officer of DSS in the hospital simply identified as Pastor to start causing uproar and in the process put a call to the CMD, Professor Peter Babatunde Olaitan, who prescribed another operation. The late DSS officer was again operated and in the process went into coma, before passing away in the early hours of Monday, September 30. In his reaction, the Public Relations Officer of the hospital, Mr. Ayo Adeyemo, when contacted on phone denied having any knowledge of the incident and promised to reach out to our correspondent later. The PRO did not fulfil that promise as at the time of filing this report. Meanwhile, the acting spokesperson of the NSCDC in Osun, Adigun Daniel confirmed the incident. He claimed that the incident was a case of accidental discharge, saying the officer lost control of his weapon and a bullet mistakingly hit the DSS officer in the stomach. He said, “Our officer and the DSS operative have been working together before the incident. Though, NSCDC does not believe in accidental discharge, we are currently conducting room trial. “We are on top of the situation to make sure such incident will not occur again.”

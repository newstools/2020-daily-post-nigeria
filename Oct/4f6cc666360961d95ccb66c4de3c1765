Thomas Partey has named five Arsenal players he admired while growing up. The Gunners bolstered their midfield with Partey, who arrived from Atletico Madrid on transfer deadline day after his £45million release clause was triggered. The 27-year-old speaking with the club’s media team on Monday, claimed he has followed the team “for a long time” and loved watching Arsene Wenger’s ‘Invincibles’, who went unbeaten throughout the 2003/2004 Premier League season. He said: “I feel so great, excited, it is something that makes me feel great, makes me feel important and it is a great feeling to be here. “I have followed Arsenal for a long time. When we were young we used to watch so many games, when they had the Invincibles season in 2004, they were so great. That is when they won the hearts of so many people. “There were a lot of great players [here at the club] before. Ian Wright was here, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira, Pires, Bergkamp was one of the greatest, and that season was great.” Partey is in contention to make his debut this Saturday, when Mikel Arteta’s men take on Manchester City.

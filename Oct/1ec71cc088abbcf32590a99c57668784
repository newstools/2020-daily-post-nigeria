All End SARS protesters detained in Lagos have been freed. They are Okara Nkem, Ayodeji Ayeni, Nduka Treasure, Adeola Adebayo, Adetifa Olanrewaju and Ademola Ojabodu. Their freedom was facilitated by House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Feyikemi Abudu, Moe Odele, among others. DAILY POST gathered that the government acted promptly to avoid the detainees passing the night in incarceration. There were fears of a mob attack which would degenerate the ongoing situation. The Speaker and the Governor spoke on their intervention Tuesday night. “Gladly we have been able to secure the release of Ademola Ojabodu, the last of the 6 arrested people. We must and will continue to protect our rights at all times”, Gbaja tweeted. “I gave a directive to the CP to effect the release of the arrested protesters and they have all been released. Every citizen has a right to protest peacefully”, Sanwo-Olu tweeted an hour later. He assured that no one will be punished for engaging in a peaceful protest.

World Trade Organization (WTO) members have selected two final candidates for the final round, in the race to lead the organization, Bloomberg reports. They are: Nigeria’s Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala and South Korea’s Yoo Myung-hee. With the two women advancing to the final round of the selection process, the WTO will likely have the first female director-general in its 25-year history. Okonjo-Iweala served two stints as Nigeria’s Finance Minister and is a former managing director of the World Bank. Yoo is South Korea’s current Trade Minister. During her 25-year career in government, she has helped expand the country’s trade network through bilateral accords with the USA, China and the UK. WTO General Council Chairman, David Walker, will formally announce the results to the institution’s delegates on Thursday morning in Geneva.

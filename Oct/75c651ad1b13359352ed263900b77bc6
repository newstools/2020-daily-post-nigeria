The Federal Government has said all prospective corps members must undergo COVID-19 tests ahead of the reopening of orientation camps nationwide. It also confirmed all National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camps would reopen effective November 10, 2020. This was disclosed by the National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu, during a briefing in Abuja on Thursday. NYSC camps were shut since March this year, as part of measures to curtail the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. But speaking on Thursday, Aliyu said, “We have developed guidelines with the NCDC (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control) and the NYSC in the preparation for the reopening of the orientation camps on the 10th of November, 2020. “The PTF has also arranged additional safeguards to include the testing of all ‘corpers’ and staff in the camps for COVID-19 tests prior to commencement of the orientation programmes.

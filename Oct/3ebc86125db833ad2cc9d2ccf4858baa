As Nigeria celebrates 60 years of independence, there’s no better time to wear those green and white colors proudly, and with Nike releasing its 2020 Super Eagles Football kit this October 1st, the standards have certainly been set! In February, Nike unveiled the design for this new collection which is coming strongly after the success of the 2018 design. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-844711 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_NIGERIA-KIT-03_native_1600-695x1024.jpg" alt="" width="695" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_NIGERIA-KIT-03_native_1600-695x1024.jpg 695w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_NIGERIA-KIT-03_native_1600-204x300.jpg 204w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_NIGERIA-KIT-03_native_1600-1043x1536.jpg 1043w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020_NIGERIA-KIT-03_native_1600.jpg 1086w" sizes="(max-width: 695px) 100vw, 695px"> This new design however, is exceptional and brilliant in its own right. Not only does it reflect artistic emblems rooted in the Nigerian culture, but it also brags of the best ever textile and fashion technology. In making this collection, 4D samples of the design were created and analysed against data on football-specific movements of more than 300 footballers. This was to project how the kit will perform on the body with regard to stretching, draping and fit, with an aim for the kits to be 55% faster in moisture-wicking, 13% more breathable and possess 10% more stretch than the previous collection For this, an intelligent knitting structure was used to ensure that knitting was precise in needed areas and vented in areas prone to heat. This new collection which features an extensive array of the National team’s official attire including a poncho, vest, dress is now available across FastForward stores, the official Nike apparel outlet in the country.

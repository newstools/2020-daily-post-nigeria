David Adeleke aka Davido and Ayo Balogun alias Wizkid have declared that the End SARS protests are not over yet. The Nigerian music superstars gave separate opinions on Sunday. Their reactions followed continued attacks on protesters by the Police in Abuja and other places. The situations in the nation’s capital and Ogbomoso, in Oyo State, are particularly dire. This is despite SARS disbandment, announced by the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. Wizkid, who joined the London demonstration, told the police to stop brutalizing Nigerians. “This is just the beginning!! We won our fight to #ENDSARS. Now Reform the Nigerian police!! We deserve good governance! #Endpolicebrutality”, he tweeted. Davido, also via Twitter, spoke in the same vein. “It’s far from over…we never win anything”, the FEM crooner asserted.

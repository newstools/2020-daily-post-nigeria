The Police Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba on Friday gave reasons why it would be very difficult for the Nigeria Police Force to totally disband the operations, and activities of the Special Anti-robbery Squad, SARS. Mba, who was a guest on Channels TV Sunrise Daily programme, said that it would be hard to end SARS because of the amount of investment that the government has made in setting up the police department and the very critical roles it is playing. Recall that Nigerians across the country have been protesting the illegality and unconstitutional activities of SARS operatives. According to Mba, SARS operatives also play a critical role in the fighting bandits, terrorists and other kinds of criminals in Nigeria. He said: “If the #EndSARS hashtag is seen as a symbolic call for the reform of SARS, I would say clearly that the leadership of the NPF is in line and ready to work with those making that call. “However, if the hashtag should be seen as a call for the total disbandment of SARS, I would tell you very clearly that it will be difficult for any responsible organization to work that path, taking into cognizance the amount of investment in training that government has made in setting up that department and the very critical roles it is playing. “As a matter of fact, we have received a lot of calls from people particularly in states like Maiduguri, Yobe, and some other parts of the north where SARS operatives are deeply embedded in the fight against banditry, insurgency. “And these people have made it very clear that ending SARS is not even an option for them because of the critical roles SARS operatives are playing in those areas, heavily on bandits, terrorists and other kinds of criminals.”

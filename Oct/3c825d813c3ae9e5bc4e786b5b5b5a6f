Edo State Deputy Governor, Philip Shaibu has said hoodlums have hijacked the End SARS protests in Benin City, the State capital. The Deputy Governor, who confirmed that there were jail breaks in two Correctional Centres on Monday, said 3 ladies were raped and many others killed by reckless drivers. He said for this reason the state government had to swing into action to save lives and property, insisting that these were not the genuine #EndSARS protesters. “Hoodlums actually have taken over the exercise,” Mr. Shaibu told Channels TV. “It’s quite unfortunate that the #EndSARS protest today in Benin went violent. The Correctional Service at Sapele Road and Oko Prison were invaded and there were jail breaks on both sides. “And before then, during the weekend, we were having some…hoodlums took over actually. Yesterday, three young ladies were raped and some, through reckless driving hitting some persons, a lot of lives are already being lost and for the state government, it is not acceptable. “For the legitimate protest by the #EndSARS, we acknowledge the fact that they have the rights to protest and that demands are legitimate. “But the events of the day before yesterday, yesterday and today…I’m very convinced that it’s not the same young men and women I joined in this #EndSARS rally on two occasions. “So, it became very important that we protect lives and property, including even the genuine ENDSARS protesters.” DAILY POST reported the attack on a maximum prison by hoodlums in Benin City on Monday.

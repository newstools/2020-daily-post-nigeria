Nigerian youths have opposed the oath of secrecy issued to their representatives on the Lagos panel probing the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). The judicial body was constituted by the state government on October 15. Rinu Oduala and Temitope Majekodunmi joined Lagos Panel of Enquiry and Restitution for Victims on Tuesday. The oath given to them to sign leaked to social media and respondents are upset. Many have insisted that details of hearings must be made public.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-852294" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_114544.jpg" alt="" width="810" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_114544.jpg 810w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_114544-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_114544-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"> Meanwhile, the panel reportedly withdrew the oath before swearing in the youth reps. Moe Odele, an End SARS advocate and co-founder of the Feminist Coalition, gave the update. “This has been rejected after concerns were raised and a dialogue was held this morning. The panelists will not be signing this document,” the lawyer tweeted.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-852296" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121542-1.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1536" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121542-1.jpg 2048w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121542-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121542-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121542-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"> Nigeria Bar Association (NBA) President, Olumide Apata, journalists, observers, among others are at the venue of the sitting. Oduala, Majekodunmi and other panel members are tasked with listening to the submissions of SARS survivors, interrogating the accused personnel, and determining the veracity of all claims. They will also recommend punishments for the guilty and appropriate compensation for the victims. The panel will sit on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10 am to 4 pm at the Lagos Court of Arbitration at Remi Olowude Street, in Lekki.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-852297" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121549-1.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1536" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121549-1.jpg 2048w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121549-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121549-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201027_121549-1-1536x1152.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px">

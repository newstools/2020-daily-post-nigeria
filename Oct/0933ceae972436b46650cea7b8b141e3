Edinson Cavani has claimed it was a conversation he had with manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer that convinced him to join Manchester United. The Uruguay striker became a United player on deadline day. Cavani has been without a club since March and since leaving Paris Saint-Germain. The 33-year-old has now signed a one-year contract with an option for a further year. “Yes, I had a conversation with the manager, and to be truthful that also really encouraged me to come to United. “We spoke a bit about the mental side of things, and a little about how you can go about preparing for each game, about what it is to compete, about what is important within a group, and you could say that we agreed strongly on a lot of the things we spoke about and discussed. Things like self-sacrifice, commitment to your teammates, creating a competitive spirit, and thinking of others, and competing altogether. All things that I really like and appreciate. “I believe that when you pretty much agree on things like this and think in a similar way, I reckon it also makes you want to join a club even more, and to then give of your best, train hard and prepare yourself in the best way you can,” Cavani told the Manchester United website. Cavani has the third best goal-scoring record in Europe behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi since his debut in 2007.

Edinson Cavani has said he is ready for the “responsibility” of wearing Manchester United’s No. 7 shirt. The Uruguay striker signed a two-year contract with the Old Trafford outfit on Monday. Cavani will follow in the footsteps of Eric Cantona, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo by inheriting United’s No. 7. “It will give me great pride to wear the No. 7 shirt for Manchester United. “Now I am going to prepare for this responsibility, do my best to be ready and enjoy it and I hope to make my mark at Manchester United. “I have two years of a contract with Manchester United. I want to give it my all here. I feel good,” Cavani told ESPN’s “90 Minutos.” Cavani joins as a free agent, after seven years at Paris Saint-Germain. He has however not played a competitive game since March.

A High Court sitting in Kano and presided by Justice Jamilu Shehu Suleiman has countered the removal of seven councillors who impeached the Kumbotso Local Government Chairman Kabiru Ado Panshekara. In an expert Interim Order, the presiding Judge restrained the local government Chairman his Secretary and the State Assembly from tampering with the tenure of the councillors. The seven councillors had last month impeached the Kumbotso Local government Chairman Kabiru Ado Minjibir for alleged gross violation of constitutional orders and misappropriation of council funds. However, the Chairman was alleged to have connived with the State Assembly to not only stop the impeachment moves but sacked the sponsors of the impeachment notice. But in an interim order granted to the Plaintiffs and Applicants, the Presiding Judge Justice Jamilu Shehu banned the Dependents and Respondents from interfering with the constitutional rights, functions and duties of the applicants as councillors representing their respective wards. The court also directed the Chairman and all others to allow the Plaintiffs/Applicants to have access to their respective offices. The court also restrained the local government Chairman Kabiru Ado Minjibir from taking any further actions and staying all actions pertaining to suspension or removal of the councillors from their respective offices pending the hearing and determination of the motions on notice.

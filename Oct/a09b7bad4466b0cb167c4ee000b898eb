Three young men are presently cooling off at a police cell in Ogun state for allegedly gangraping a teenager in Pata, Ifo area of the state. The Ogun Police Command said the suspects were arrested on Wednesday after the incident was reported at Ifo Police station by one Alimi Olasunkanmi an administrative officer of the Ogun State So-Safe Corps. Olasunkanmi had informed the police that three brothers ambushed the girl while she went to take a bath at Odo-Pata stream, at Pata Abiodun village in Ifo Local government area at about 10:00am. The suspects, who identified by the Ogun Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, as Oluwaseun Damilohun, 20; Oriyomi Damilohun, 19; and Oluwasegun Idowu, 18, were said to have dragged the victim forcefully into a nearby bush, where they “took turns to have sex with her against her consent.” “While the devilish act was going on, one of them was video-recording the act with a threat that if the victim dares to report, they would upload it on the internet,” Oyeyemi told DAILY POST. Upon the report, the DPO of Ifo, CSP Adeniyi Adekunle, reportedly led his men to the scene with some So Safe Corps members and got the suspects arrested. Oyeyemi revealed that the trio “have all confessed to the commission of the crime.” Meanwhile, Edward Ajogun, who is the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, has directed the immediate transfer of the suspects to anti-human trafficking and child labour unit.

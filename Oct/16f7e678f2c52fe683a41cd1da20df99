Sergio Aguero has joked that he and Lionel Messi are “like an old married couple”, when they hook up on Argentina duty. Messi made his debut for his country in 2005, a year before Aguero joined the Argentina senior set-up. The duo have played together at three World Cups, four Copa Americas and won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Although both players always share a room, Aguero has revealed that he always leaves Messi complaining. “He always complains, we are like an old married couple. “I always fall asleep with the TV on and when I wake up the next morning he is always complaining to me. “He arrives at the hotel and instantly takes a shower while I’m just sitting talking on my mobile phone. Then he will remind me that we need to go down to dinner and we do not have time,” Aguero said on the Santo Sabado programme.

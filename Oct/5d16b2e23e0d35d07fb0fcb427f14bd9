Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, has distanced himself from the attack on former Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose. Recall that Fayose was attacked by hoodlums during the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governorship campaign in Ondo State on Wednesday. Reacting to the attack, Fayose accused Makinde and a chieftain of the party, Bode George of being responsible for the assault he suffered. However, Makinde, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Taiwo Adisa, said he wouldn’t want to join issues with Fayose. He said: “I believe that ex-Governor Fayose and his handlers need to look far away from Oyo State in search of their enemies. “Governor Makinde has no link whatsoever with the incident Fayose’s aide was talking about.”

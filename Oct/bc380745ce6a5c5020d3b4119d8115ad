Principals of public schools and private schools owners in Kwara State risk severe sanctions if they fail to adhere strictly to the safety guidelines of Covid-19 as spelt out by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC. The state Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development, Hajia Fatimah Bisola Ahmed, handed down the warning while monitoring the ongoing Basic Education Certificate Examination, BECE, in Ilorin. Apparently angered by the low level of compliance, she said “let me remind you that Covid-19 is real and is still in our midst. “Any school that does not comply with the safety guidelines of Covid-19 will be sanctioned or closed down immediately. “The level of compliance is low compared to the last time we re-opened schools partially. Both students and teachers are indifferent to safety guidelines of NCDC.” The commissioner warned principals and private schools owners to abide by the rules or face severe sanctions. She also asked parents and guardians to report any school that demands third term school fees to the ministry for necessary action.

M.I, showing support for the protest revealed that he did not join the protest because of his health condition. On his Twitter page, the rapper wrote: “Unfortunately, I’m still not feeling well enough to be outside but I stand with @falzthebahdguy and @iRuntown and all the amazing young people using their voices to say #EndSars.”

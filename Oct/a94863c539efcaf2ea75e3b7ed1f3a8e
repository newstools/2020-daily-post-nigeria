Nigerian actor and comedian, Kunle Idowu, also known as Frank Donga, has raised some questions over the recent jail break in Benin City, the Edo State capital. Protesters around Kings Square in Benin City were said to have broken the walls of the headquarters of the Nigeria Correctional Centre and gained entrance to its premises on Monday. The protesters freed inmates in the prisons, along Benin Sapele Road, near the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ office. And Frank Donga believes much more should have been done to secure the prison going by the fund allocated to it yearly. “Where are the CCTVs in Benin prisons?” He asked “The Nigeria Prisons Service allocations increased from N4Billion in 2015 to N16Billion yearly from 2016-2018 ( that’s N50Billion for 240 prisons). “They bought 245 vehicles between 2016-17 and spent N800M on firearms. I tweet in peace. #EndSARS.” He tweeted further, “Funds allocated for prisons are:
N2.64Billion (provision and construction)
N3.27Billion (rehabilitation and repair)
2017 N7.07Billion (provision and construction) N153.79 Million ( rehabilitations and repair) 2018
N8.07Billion (provision construction)
N3.42Billion (procession and repair).”

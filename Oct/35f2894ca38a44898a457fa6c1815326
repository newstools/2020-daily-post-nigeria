Manchester United failed to sign any of the players that manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer made priority targets this summer transfer window, ESPN reports. United completed deals for Edinson Cavani, Alex Telles, Amad Traore and Facundo Pellistri on deadline day. The club had earlier signed Donny van de Beek from Ajax for £40million at the beginning of September. But Solskjaer went into the window having drawn up a shortlist of targets, including Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho, Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish and a commanding centre-half, with RB Leipzig’s Dayot Upamecano and Bournemouth’s Nathan Ake his preferred options to partner captain Harry Maguire at the heart of United’s defence. It is believed that none of the subsequent summer signings were players identified by Solskjaer and his coaching staff as key targets. However, he was consulted by the club on every new arrival. Solskjaer also missed out on top target Erling Haaland during the January transfer window, with the Norwegian instead moving to Dortmund from FC Salzburg. Having failed to sign Haaland, United eventually brought in Odion Ighalo on a short-term loan from Shanghai Shenhua on January 31.

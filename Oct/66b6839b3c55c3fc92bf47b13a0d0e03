The police in Ogun State said they have arrested seven suspects who were accused of fraudulently hacking into one Gbemisola Ajimoh’s bank account and siphoned N1.5million. Police identified the suspects as: Adeoti Busayo, Oshin Esther, Seni Habeeb, Morakinyo Titilayo, Tomiwa Adeosun, Mayowa Morakinyo and Adewunmi Olanrewaju. The Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, told newsmen that the N1.5million was used to purchase goods like mobile phones online. According to Ajogun, the mobile phones were sold to a phone seller, Adewunmi Olanrewaju, at the popular Computer Village in Ikeja, Lagos State. He informed that the police, after arresting other accomplices in the case, visited the Computer Village on Monday with a view to inviting the buyer for questioning. He added that, in the process, the phone seller raised the alarm and mobilized hoodlums (who were seen in a viral video) screaming EndSARS, to prevent his arrest. He said the hoodlums subsequently beat up the team of policemen. It was learnt that the siphoned money belonged to butchers operating at the Abiola Way abattoir, behind Majodutimi junction, Abeokuta. The butchers had kept the money in Gbemisola’s account, who usually helped them to transfer same to cow sellers, as they could not operate a bank account. But, Gbemisola, who was said to have given her ATM card to Esther Oshin, later found out that her account had been debited to the tune of N1.5million. Esther, it was gathered, sought the service of internet fraudsters who broke into the account after obtaining data of the ATM and siphoned the N1.5million. The case was reported by Gbemisola at the Adatan Police station, Abeokuta. DAILY POST learnt that the suspects have refunded N1.2m out of the N1.5million stolen. The police boss disclosed that all the suspects have confessed to the crime and would be prosecuted as soon as possible.

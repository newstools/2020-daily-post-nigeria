Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 winner, Laycon on Friday said he tried to stop Erica from sharing a bed with Kiddwaya because of a conversation they had. He confirmed that Erica had told him that she does not want to do anything on live TV. However, when she was tipsy after that Saturday party, he told Tolanibaj and Dorathy to handle the situation because he cared for Erica as a friend. Laycon during his media said, ”My action was just me caring for a friend based on what happened at the arena. I told Tolanibaj and Dorathy to handle the situation because of our conversation. ”It was not personal, I was just looking out for a friend, remember I slept at the garden that night so I was acting based on what she told me.” Speaking of his friendship with Kiddwaya despite liking Erica, Laycon said he became comfortable with their relationship because Kiddwaya is his friend. ”I don’t how my friendship with kiddwaya started but I know for a fact that before Erica left I was comfortable with their relationship
”Kiddwaya is a wonderful person, he is likable and a cruise guy, so because kiddwaya is my guy I was cool with them.”

Men of the Nigeria Police Force, NPF, on Friday teargassed peaceful protesters against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, in Abuja. The police teargassed the protesters in a bid to disperse them. Some of the protesters alleged that the police officers dispersed them while fully armed. Videos showed the police officers were armed with guns and teargas canisters, pursuing the protesters while shooting teargas at them. In the past few days, Nigerians across the country have been protesting against the illegality and unconstitutional activities of SARS operatives.

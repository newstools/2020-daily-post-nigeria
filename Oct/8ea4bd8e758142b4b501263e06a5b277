A Domestic Violence and Sexual Offences Court in Ikeja, Lagos, on Thursday ordered that a 41-year-old cleric, Adam Faruk, who allegedly defiled eight pupils, be remanded in a correctional centre. The Lagos State Government, charged Faruk a Ghanian, whose address was not given, with eight counts bordering on sexual assault. The cleric, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges, NAN reports. Justice Abiola Soladoye adjourned the matter until Nov. 16 for trial. Earlier, the state prosecutor, Mr Peter Owolabani told the court that Faruk committed the offence between November 2018 and February 2019 at the Islamic school located at No. 1, Jaiye Balogun St., Parkview Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos. Owolabani alleged that the defendant sexually assaulted eight female pupils, whose ages ranged between six and 11. The prosecutor alleged that the defendant threatened to harm the victims. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos; 2015.

Spain coach, Luis Enrique, has reacted to his side’s 0-0 friendly draw with Portugal on Wednesday. Enrique insisted that Spain were better than Portugal, adding that his team dominated the game against the host at the Jose Alvalade stadium. Cristiano Ronaldo struck the crossbar as Portugal, and Spain played out a goalless draw in Lisbon last night. Ronaldo and Renato Sanchez both hit the woodwork for Portugal, who then should have won the match in injury-time only for Atletico Madrid’s Joao Felix to miskick at the back post. Spain went close through Dani Olmo, but neither side was able to claim victory for Enrique’s men. “I think we were better than Portugal,” Enrique told reporters at post-match. “We dominated the game. “For sure they had two shots on the break that hit the bar and one that Kepa saved, but we had chances as well.”

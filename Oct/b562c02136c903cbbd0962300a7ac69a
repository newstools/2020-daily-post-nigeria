Former Real Madrid midfielder, Guti, has urged the club manager, Zinedine Zidane, to sign Paris Saint-Germain stars, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. Guti said this following Real Madrid’s Champions League 3-2 loss to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday. Real Madrid were defeated at home against Shakhtar Donetsk, after three goals from Tete, Raphael Varane, (OG) and Manor Solomon. Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior did score for the La Liga champions. “I would sign Neymar and Kylian Mbappe for Real Madrid,” Guti was quoted by Goal as saying. “It won’t determine who will win La Liga, but it is an important match,” Guti added. “Mentally, if a player does well or a team wins, then it can do you good for what is still to come in La Liga.” Real Madrid will face Barcelona this weekend in the La Liga El Clasico match.

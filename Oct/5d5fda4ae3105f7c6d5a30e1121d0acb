A Political Science graduate of the University of Calabar, Meshach Asukwo Edem has taken the responsibility of keeping the streets and venues of the protest clean. DAILY POST observed that Meshach, on Friday, armed with a large polythene bag, moved round, collecting all forms of dirt, be it wet or dry including rubbers, cans, sachet etc. to keep the environment clean. Speaking with DAILY POST at Marian Road by Atekong junction, one of the venues for the protest, Meshach said that he was not paid for what he was doing. “Packing the dirt was driven by passion for keeping the environment clean during and after every protest. I enjoy doing it and I will continue to do it as far as the protest lasts,” he said. “I am a graduate of Political Science, University of Calabar, I am trying to keep the environment clean as the youths are not associated with dirt. “As we protest, air our views, as well as demand for our right, to tell the government what we want, we also have the responsibility to keep our environment clean “Basically, that is what I am doing and make sure that everywhere is clean so that everything can go well. I started this during the 2nd protest,” he stated hoping that the government will adhere to their cries and meet their demands.

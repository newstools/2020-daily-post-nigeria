Legendary Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has admitted he would have considered a place on the club’s board as an adviser. The Frenchman revealed this in a Q&A organized by the UK Guardian. Wenger, who spent 22 years as the Gunners boss before leaving in 2018, is yet to take a managerial job. The 78-year-old is currently FIFA’s Chief Head of Global Football Development. When asked by Mourinho if he ever considered such becoming a top exec, such as a CEO or director of football, at perhaps Arsenal, Wenger replied: “No, I would have considered being on the board at Arsenal as an adviser. “I believe that honestly there is a deficit of knowledge in the big clubs of top, top-level competition and games of top-level sport. And I believe we have seen recently that there are many ways to be successful in football. “For example, there’s the Bayern [Munich] way, where the whole success and continuity relies on people who know the values of the club, and they transfer that from generation to generation: Beckenbauer, Hoeness, Rummenigge. Or there are models in England of quick money and quick success. Both can work. “I like the fact that a club is first an identity and has knowledge that is transferred from generation to generation. So that’s why I saw things that way.”

Three weeks after the Ondo State Governorship Election, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic, PDP, Eyitayo Jegede, SAN, on Friday headed to the state Election petition tribunal to challenge the victory of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Joined in the petition are the Independent National Electoral Commission, the All Progressives Congress and the Deputy Governor-elect, Lucky Aiyedatiwa. INEC had declared Akeredolu winner of the October 10, 2020 Governorship Election having polled a total vote of 292,830 to defeat Jegede who scored 195,791 votes. Jegede who is challenging the election held on October 10, on four grounds, petitioned that the election was marred with irregularities and pockets of violence and intimidation. Jegede also faulted the emergence of Akeredolu during the party’s primaries held on June 20. According to Jegede, “in the last 19 days, I have been silent, today we broke that silence in obedience to the provisions of our laws. “We have commenced a challenge against the declaration and return made by INEC in respect of the Ondo State Governorship election of 10th October, 2020. “By this process, let our people again begin to hope for a better future to the glory of God. God bless Ondo State. Eyi N’ise Oluwa,” Jegede said.

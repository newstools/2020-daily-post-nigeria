A number of security operatives have opened fire in Lekki, a highbrow area of Lagos. They are going after End SARS protesters. The demonstrators have been camping at the Lekki Toll Gate for more than 10 days. On Tuesday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu ordered a 24-hour curfew. The state police command also announced a ban on public gatherings. The spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi, disclosed that operatives have been dispatched to strategic points. But the protesters remained adamant, insisting they have been peaceful and would not leave. The government has now gone in with full force. Video: They are shooting at peaceful protesters in Lekki! People who were not armed and not violent. These actions are unforgivable and unconstitutional.  #EndSARS pic.twitter.com/9fWCnUvuz1 — feministcoalition (@feminist_co) October 20, 2020 Lekki toll gate as been attack by military men, we need help #EndSARS pic.twitter.com/DSppEe7JWg — bhello adhams (@bello_adams) October 20, 2020

Bukola Saraki, former Senate President, on Saturday, urged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government to immediately put a stop to the harassment of Nigerians by operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS. Saraki also urged the federal government to restructure the unit for better protection of Nigerians. He said this in a series of tweets via his verified Twitter handle. “The reports of the continued harassment, illegal arrest, detention and high handedness by rogue cells of the SARS Unit of @PoliceNG against innocent Nigerians – most of them young people – in spite of efforts to reform the Police & raise standards of policing, are disheartening. “A situation where the officers of @PoliceNG become a threat to the lives and property of the very citizens they swore to protect is condemnable and unacceptable. “I call on the Federal Government to immediately put a stop to these reprehensible activities and restructure the unit to better perform its lawful duties of safe guarding the lives and property of the Nigerian people.”

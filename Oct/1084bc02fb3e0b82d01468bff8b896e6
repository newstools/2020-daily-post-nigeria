Mesut Ozil is the most high-profile Arsenal player in danger of losing his place in the 25-man squad Arteta will submit to the Premier League, Goal reports. Arteta has to leave two first-team players after the summer transfer window closed on Monday. The Gunners pulled off the last-minute signing of Thomas Partey from Atletico Madrid, but couldn’t offload some of the players they wanted to leave. Arsenal now has 19 non-homegrown players in their squad and are only permitted to submit a maximum of 17 to the Premier League. Arteta has to pick two senior first-team players to leave out of the squad. Initial speculations indicated it would be Pablo Mari and Cedric Soares. However, the decision has not been finalised and Ozil is also in the frame to be axed despite being the club’s highest earner on £350,000-a-week. Ozil has not featured at all since football resumed after the lockdown. Two others who are in danger of being cut out are Sokratis and Shkodran Mustafi.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has explained why he didn’t start midfielder, Paul Pogba, in his side’s Premier League 4-1 victory against Newcastle United on Saturday. Man United defeated Newcastle at St James’ Park, thanks to goals from Bruno Fernandes, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Marcus Rashford. Pogba had started Man United’s three previous Premier League matches, but he was only handed a place among the substitutes against Newcastle. The France international came on for Fred in the 69th minute, with the scoreline at 1-1. But Solskjaer is now saying that Pogba was only fit enough for a spot on the Red Devils bench, adding that the 27-year-old returned from international duty with a number of complaints which meant he was not able to start the match. Explaining his decision to start Pogba from the bench after the game, Solskjaer told post-match: “Paul had hip and back problems when he was away with France, so it wasn’t right to start him.” “We have got big games coming up,” He added. “Everyone has to perform when they come on. I am delighted for him.” Man United’s next game is against PSG in the Champions League on Tuesday.

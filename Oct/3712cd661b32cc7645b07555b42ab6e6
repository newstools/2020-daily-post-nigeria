The Organization of Emerging African States (OEAS), has renewed its call for the Nigerian government to meet the demands for the actualization of Biafra. OEAS is an international governmental organization that promotes self-determination and the end to colonial era boundaries in Africa. In a statement to DAILY POST on Sunday by its General Secretary, Ebenezer Derek Mbongo Akwanga, Jr., and Jonathan Levy, Chief Administrative Officer, the group noted that, “today, the people of Biafra fear the brutality of the Nigeria police who are slaughtering their own citizens and arming herdsman as pro-government militias. “The situation will surely escalate unless immediate action is taken,” it said. The OEAS further made the following demands to the Nigerian government: “All federal military and police forces in Biafra to stand down and return to their barracks. “A snap referendum on Biafran self-determination to be held within 90 days with OEAS, UNPO, and nonaligned observers supervising the balloting process. “The situation in Nigeria is fast spiraling out of control,” the organization said.

The United States Government has reacted to the murder of school kids in Cameroon. On Saturday, armed men stormed Mother Francisca Nursery and Primary School in Kumba. The vicious attack left a number of young children dead and wounded. In a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Cameroon condemned the incident in the strongest terms. America condoled with the families of the children killed, the wounded, their family members, and all others affected. “We stand with them in this time of grief and express gratitude to all those providing medical care to the wounded. “The heinous, despicable act shows contempt for innocent lives which most represent the hope of a positive future.” The statement said violence must stop and children be allowed to exercise their right to go to school without fear for their safety. The U.S. demanded that perpetrators be held accountable and be brought to justice.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-851752" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201025_114517.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201025_114517.jpg 1280w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201025_114517-300x169.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201025_114517-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px">

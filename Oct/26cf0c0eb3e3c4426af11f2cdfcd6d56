Popular Nigerian singer, Davido, on Tuesday met with the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. Davido’s meeting with Gbajabiamila was centred around the brutality of the dissolved Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, in Abuja. Speaking after the meeting, the singer called for the punishment of all officials found guilty. In a series of tweets, the singer said officers found guilty should be arrested and prosecuted. According to Davido: “Minor victories and they’re all coming together. Little by little. “From social media, to the streets to the office of the Inspector General of Police to the office of the Speaker of the House of reps. “Each and every single one of our voices is being heard! 5 for 5 granted. “Now let’s get some timelines and some action! Most immediately all guilty officers arrested! And no closed doors! Parade them like every other suspect.”

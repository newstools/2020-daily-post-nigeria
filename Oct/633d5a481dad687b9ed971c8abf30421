Manchester United have informed Paul Pogba they have no desire to entice him to remain at the club with a bumper new contract, ESPN reports. Pogba was heavily linked with a move away from Old Trafford last summer, but he eventually ended up staying despite interest from Real Madrid and Juventus. United have prevented the possibility of the 27-year-old leaving on a free transfer in the summer, by exercising a clause in his current deal, to extend his stay at the club by one year. The club is however keen to keep the midfielder beyond then, but won’t splash out big to convince him to stay. United are refusing to be held to ransom by Pogba or his agent, Mino Raiola and will only offer him a “reasonable” pay increase. United’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward is said to have put his foot down and refused to offer players exorbitant contracts in the wake of the Alexis Sanchez saga. Pogba is currently taking home a staggering £270,000-a-week.

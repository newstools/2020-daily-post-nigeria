The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has nabbed a suspected fraudster popularly known as Yahoo Boys, Adebayo Olawale. Olawale was apprehended by the Gombe Zonal Office of the EFCC alongside one Pastor Gbenga Moses Adesoju of Christ Apostolic Church, Ile-Ife, Osun State. The duo were nabbed for allegedly defrauding one Umar Hayatu to the tune of N12.7m. According to EFCC spokesman, Wilson Uwajaren, while the suspects reside in Ile-Ife, Osun State, the victim was a resident of Lafiya Quarters, Dukku Council of Gombe State. A statement issued by Uwajaren yesterday in Abuja said the suspects were picked up at Ile Ife following a petition by Hayatu’s relatives. The anti-graft agency disclosed that Olawale and his pastor conspired and defrauded Hayatu using social media platforms and phone calls under the pretense that he won a car, some expensive phones and offer of employment into a juicy position. EFCC said Olawale had contacted the victim, using fake Facebook account names; Williams Angellina and Omolola Adebayo to deceive Hayatu that his parents owned a company abroad and will make him the Nigerian manager of the company situated in Lagos State. The statement reads in part: “Adebayo, the prime suspect, contacted the victim severally, using fake Facebook account names; Williams Angellina and Omolola Adebayo and deceived the victim into believing that his parents have a company abroad and will make him (victim) the Nigerian Manager of the company at Lagos. “The suspect further sent the victim various fake pictures of houses and cars that would be given to him as fringe benefits as soon as the company commences operation. He also promised him 30,000 US Dollars and expensive gifts such as iPhone and Jewelries.”

Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham side continues their Europa League dream on Thursday when they take on Belgium side Royal Antwerp. The London side has endured a difficult start to the 2020-21 campaign. They needed three qualifying games to reach the Europa League group stage. The Spurs team have put together 10 games without losing a match in all competition, the latest result coming this past Monday as they defeated Sean Dyches Burnley side 0-1 at the Turf Moor. DAILY POST evaluates Spurs could line-up for the contest against Royal Antwerp. Absent; Joe Rodon (in eligible), Taphet Tanganga (thigh). Possible; Steven Bergwijin (knock), Serge Aurier (knock). Ben Davies and Moussa Sissoko are likely to keep their places in the contest among some of the players that started the match against Burnley for Tottenham Hotspur. Ben Davies could switch to the centre since Joe Rondon is ineligible for the match and this would allow Sergio Regulion to return to the left-back. Serge Aurier and Steven Bergwijn both missed the Burnley game due to a knock, while one or both of them could return on the right-hand side. Giovani Lo Celso is expected to get the nod in the attacking midfield meaning that Dele Alli could be named among the substitute bench. Carlos Vinicius and Gareth Bale could return to Spurs starting XI, though their exact positions would depend on how Jose Mourinho decides to set up his defence line (with three or four at the back). Harry Kane and Heung-Min Son are expected to be on the bench for Spurs but Toby Alderweield could be rested after sustaining a cut on his head against Sean Dyche’s Burnley side at the Turf Moor. Royal Antwerp vs Tottenham Hotspur expected line-up Joe-Hart; Serge Aurier, Carlos Sanchez, Ben Davies, Sergio Regulion; Moussa Sissoko, Harry Winks, Erik Lamela, Giovani Lo Celso, Gareth Bale; Carlos Vinicius.

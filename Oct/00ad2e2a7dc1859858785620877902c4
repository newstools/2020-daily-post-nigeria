The All Progressives Congress, APC, on Sunday reacted to the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, unit of the Nigeria Police Force. APC described the action as a major step towards President Muhammadu Buhari’s resolve to reform the police system in the country. Yekini Nabena, Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the APC stated this in a statement he signed. Following the outcry by Nigerians, the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu announced the dissolution of the notorious police formation. However, Nabena expressed hope that the new policing arrangement would adequately combat armed robbery, kidnapping and other crimes. According to Nabena: “APC welcomed the disbandment of the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) and views the responsive decision as a major and concrete step towards President Muhammadu Buhari affirmed resolve to achieve better policing and necessary reforms. “With the benefit of experience and public outcry over the operations of the now-disbanded SARS, the APC is confident that the new policing arrangement promised by the Inspector-General of Police, Adamu Mohammed will balance the need to effectively combat armed robbery, kidnapping and other violent crimes in the country and ensure humane, professional and accountable police operations. “We call on Nigerians to take advantage of the Citizens’ and Strategic Stakeholders’ Forum which is being formed to regularly interface with Police leadership at all levels and advise on police activities as they affect the general public.”

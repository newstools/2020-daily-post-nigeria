Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide has described the unreserved apologies of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of indigenous people of Biafra, IPOB, as a welcome development. Kanu is said to have tendered the apology during his interview with veteran Journalist, Dele Momodu, on Thursday evening. OYC, in a statement to DAILY POST signed by Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, its Secretary General, said it “commended Kanu for heeding to the advice of its (OYC) leadership to immediately tender his unreserved apologies to Ndigbo,” still called on the IPOB leader to retract his End SARS verbal attacks, inflammatory threats, and stop all unnecessary violent protests in the Southeast and the whole of Igboland. OYC said “it’s unimaginable and taboo for anyone to speak for Igbo without proper consultative approvals from Igbo stakeholders. Ipob were gradually losing relevance after their failed protests and needs to change tactical direction.” The Igbo apex youth organisation believes that “Yoruba politicians and Northeast presidential aspirant through their Selfishness are manipulating IPOB activities indirectly for 2023.” According to the group, this is to “Scuttle Igbo presidency project” warning that “It should stop henceforth, Nnamdi Kanu should learn from history especially Awolowo’s betrayal against Igbo legend, Dimm Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu in 1967.” OYC said it “wishes to inform Nnamdi Kanu, that his sins have been forgiven by Igbo Youth leadership led by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, he should,” adding that he should “go and sin no more.”

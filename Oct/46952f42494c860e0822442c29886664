Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, has ordered the relaxation of the curfew in the state from 10pm to 6am. Sanwo-Olu had imposed the curfew due to break down of law and order by hoodlums who hijacked the End SARS protests in the state. However, Sanwo-Olu’s order was contained in a statement by the Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho on Friday. Omotosho said the governor commended people of the state for observing the curfew, which is expected to restore normalcy in the communities. According to the statement: “He urges all Lagosians to go about their businesses in peace, even as they shun ‘actions that can threaten our unity. “The Governor advised purveyors of fake news to stop causing disaffection among Lagosians, who are well known for being peace-loving and friendly.”

With five days to the governorship election in Ondo State, the National Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, has assured that the October 10 poll in the state will be an improvement of the recently concluded governorship poll in Edo. Prof. Yakubu gave the assurance on Monday during the INEC Stakeholders’ meeting for the Ondo Governorship Election. According to the INEC Chairman, with the success recorded in Edo State, the commission can’t afford to low the bar in Ondo State come Saturday. While emphasizing that the commission has reviewed the last electoral process in Edo State, Yakubu stated that with some lapses identified, they will be frontally tackled in Ondo. “We identified 16 areas of improvement, including logistics, prompt response to Smart Card Reader glitches on Election Day, the menace of vote buying during elections and compliance with COVID-19 protocols. “In response, we have engaged with land and maritime transport owners for forward and reverse logistics to and from land and riverine locations. “We have engaged additional 104 Registration Area Technical Support (RATECHS) staff to respond rapidly to issues with Card Readers on Election Day. We had useful discussions with the security agencies and anti-corruption agencies on how to deal with vote buying during elections.”

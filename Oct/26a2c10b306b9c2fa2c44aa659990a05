Chelsea goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy has insisted that he has a very good relationship with fellow teammate, Kepa Arrizabalaga, despite the duo fighting for the club’s No. 1 keeper position. Mendy stated this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash against Manchester United this weekend. The Senegalese shot-stopper was signed this summer to provide competition for Kepa and Willy Caballero after Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, identified the goalkeeping position as a major issue in his Blues squad. “I have a very good relationship with Kepa, the group of goalkeepers we have, we are all very open, and all of us understand the team is the most important thing here and doing what is right for the group,” Mendy said as quoted by Metro UK. “Our relationships are all very good, we work well together, and we’re pushing each other every day to improve ourselves and improve each other. “We know as goalkeepers, we’ve to stay unified and united, and that is what is happening at the moment.” Mendy added: “To be at a club where such great goalkeepers have played is very important to me. “I am aware of the expectations surrounding the goalkeeper position at Chelsea. I am not going to put any pressure or compare myself to them because they are both legends here.”

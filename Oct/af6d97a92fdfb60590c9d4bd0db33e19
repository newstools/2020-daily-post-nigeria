Nigerian Governors have denied hoarding COVID-19 palliatives. They made the denial in reaction to the looting of several warehouses nationwide. Soon after the End SARS peaceful protests were hijacked, thousands of people in different states burgled storage facilities that housed tonnes of foodstuff. Most of the items were donated by the Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID). The body comprises business moguls and companies. At the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, they contributed funds and used the same to procure palliatives to assist the federal and state government. On Monday, the governors insisted that the items were not hidden as widely alleged. Their position was contained in a statement by Abdulrazaq Bello-Barkindo, spokesman of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF). Bello-Barkindo pleaded with members of the public to desist from spreading rumours. He reiterated that palliatives found in warehouses broken into in Lagos and some other states were kept for members of the society especially vulnerable citizens. “Until mid-October, when the NGF had its last meeting, up to ten States had not participated in the flag-off ceremonies for the distribution of palliatives in their States. This was because the items meant for distribution in these states had not been completely received from CACOVID. “Some other States that still had palliatives in their warehouses chose to keep a strategic reserve ahead of a projected second wave of COVID-19. The NGF wishes to state categorically that no State has been involved in or has hoarded any palliatives.” The NGF told contributors to the palliatives that prior to the looting, states had kept full accounts of all the items received and distributed. The governor assured that they are doing their best under the circumstances to ameliorate the needs of the population.

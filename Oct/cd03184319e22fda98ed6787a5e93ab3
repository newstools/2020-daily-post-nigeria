Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, has told Nigerians that President Muhammadu Buhari understands the pains and burdens they are going through primarily because of the economic situation aftermath of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. He said for this reason, the Federal Government is considering palliatives that can offer succor to the people. Osinbajo spoke with State House Correspondents on Monday, according to Laolu Akande, his Spokesman. According to him, “We fully understand that we must have a way of ensuring that the pain that people feel, the economic difficulty that people are going through, that we are able to address those as much as possible. “Which is why even in our current discussions with labour, one of the issues we are looking at include, what sort of palliatives are possible for the Nigerian people. In what ways can we reduce the burden and how quickly can we do so.” He said that one of those issues the government has looked at is how to reduce the cost of gas and Premium Motor Spirit, otherwise known as petrol. The VP said the government wants to make sure that Nigerians are able to go about their businesses buying cheaper energy. The Vice President explained that “one of the ways is by using Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). And the government has committed to do the conversion. First of all, we are starting with commercial vehicles.”

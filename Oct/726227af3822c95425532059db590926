An old man was on Monday beaten to stupor, allegedly by men of the Ogun State Parking Management (OGSPAM). It was gathered that the man, one Chief Adeleke Olubajo was accused of parking his Honda pilot car at a wrong place at Isale-Igbein, Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. It was gathered that Olubajo, who was identified as the CEO of Asiwaju Kakaku Motors, had parked his vehicle, waiting for someone who went to get something by the roadside. He was accused of parking on the bridge by the OGSPAM officers and this led to an altercation, it was gathered. Our correspondent, who arrived at the scene during the altercation, found the man lying unconscious by the roadside amid a mammoth crowd. Eyewitness accounts have it that the Ogun Parking Management officers allegedly dragged the man out of his vehicle and assaulted him. They were said to have fled the scene, leaving their patrol vehicle behind to avoid being lynched by the crowd. The victim, who was said to have driven himself to the area in white native attire, was seen on the floor with a singlet and a shot. Policemen from Ibara police station, however, arrived at the scene and took the unconscious man to safety. When contacted, the General Manager of OGSPAM, Engr Wale Yusuf, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. However, Yusuf declined to make comments on the issue, saying “everything is now in Ibara police station.” Yusuf said he was not in Abeokuta at the moment, saying he would not speak much about the incident. Meanwhile, he told our correspondent that he was not sure his men could behave in an unruly manner like that. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847967" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134701_031_1356440-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1191" height="2560" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134701_031_1356440-scaled.jpg 1191w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134701_031_1356440-140x300.jpg 140w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134701_031_1356440-476x1024.jpg 476w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134701_031_1356440-714x1536.jpg 714w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134701_031_1356440-953x2048.jpg 953w" sizes="(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px"> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847966" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134159_446-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1191" height="2560" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134159_446-scaled.jpg 1191w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134159_446-140x300.jpg 140w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134159_446-476x1024.jpg 476w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134159_446-714x1536.jpg 714w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134159_446-953x2048.jpg 953w" sizes="(max-width: 1191px) 100vw, 1191px"> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-847965" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134323_033-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1191" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134323_033-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134323_033-300x140.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134323_033-1024x476.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134323_033-1536x714.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/IMG_20201012_134323_033-2048x953.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px">

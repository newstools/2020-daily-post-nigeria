The Lagos State Judicial Panel of enquiry have recovered five bullet shell casings from the Lekki Tollgate Plaza, scene of the alleged shooting of End SARS protesters on October, 20th. The exhibits were discovered on Friday at the Lekki Tollgate Plaza, during an investigative visit by the nine-man panel, headed by Justice Doris Okuwobi, (NAN) reports. Earlier in the day, the panel had left the venue of its sitting at the International Court of Arbitration, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, to visit the Tollgate plaza scene of the shootings. Also in attendance were: Mr Abayomi Omomuwa, the Managing Director of the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) and Mr Gbolahan Agboluwaje, the Head of the Legal Department of LCC and the media. Five bullet casings were reportedly recovered from the floor, a gutter, as well as the staircase by persons, present during the visit. Omomuwa, during the visit, told the panel that the Close Circuit Television (CCTV) cameras mounted on a mast at the toll gate area were working during the shootings. He, however, noted that though the footage of the happenings of Oct. 20 had been captured by the CCTV, it is currently not working due to damage caused by hoodlums during the carnage of Oct. 21. On the panelâ€™s return to the venue of its proceedings, Justice Okuwobi, said the panel had made observations and had asked questions at the scene. She said that subsequent proceedings could not continue because the Managing Director of the LCC had no legal representation. She also noted that the panel had not admitted the Oct. 20 footage as evidence and when it is admitted in evidence, it will be played at the proceedings. The proceedings were adjourned until Nov. 3 for the testimony to be given by the MD of the LCC.

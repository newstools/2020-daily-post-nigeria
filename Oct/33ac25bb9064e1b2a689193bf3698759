An Isolo Magistrate Court has sentenced a 37-year-old man to 90 months imprisonment on a 10-count charge bothering on stealing of motor spare parts in Itire Market. The convict, Ogochukwu Onyeabor, upon his arraignment on Tuesday, February 4, 2020, was accused of stealing motor spare parts in the popular Itire Market and assaulting one of the security men in an attempt to resist apprehension. According to the prosecutor, Inspector Oje Uagbale, the defendant assists his brother in his shop but whenever they close, he would not go home with his brother but would rather lock himself up in the shop in a careful manner that the security at the main gate would not suspect. “He would then come out of his brother’s shop to steal spare parts from other shops which he would later sell to unsuspecting customers. “Curious search by the robbed shop owners for the missing goods led to the subsequent query of the two security men. However, on Saturday, February 1, Onyeabor was caught as he was trying to cut the iron used in binding some spare parts in one of the shops. The security men finally apprehended him and handed him over to the police at Itire Police Division. “While some of the goods were recovered from him, Onyeabor confessed that he had sold some of the goods cheaper prices and pleaded guilty to the 10-count charges which include unlawful entry with an intent to steal, stealing, willful damage to properties and unlawful assault,” he said. Having found him guilty of the charges, the presiding Magistrate, Miss Olufunmilayo Teluwo, sentenced Onyeabor to nine months imprisonment for each count charge, a sentence that is expected to run concurrently.

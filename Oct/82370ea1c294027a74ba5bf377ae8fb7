Sodiq Abubakar Yusuf aka CDQ has hinted that he will go into the studio to address Seyi Tinubu. Seyi is a son of Bola Tinubu, former Lagos State Governor and All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader. In a post on Twitter, CDQ disclosed that there was an altercation Wednesday night at the house of David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido. The indigenous hip-hop rapper accused Seyi of disrespect. Noting that he was not from a rich family, CDQ declared he is an hustler from the slum and won’t not let the matter slide. “Seyi Tinubu I’m bouta compose an article for you about what you did to me last night @ David’s house”, he tweeted on Thursday. “I might not be born with silver spoon like you but bruh I’m a fighter and a strong hustler that germinated from the slum to where I am today. I won’t take disrespect from anyone.” (sic). The tweet has generated thousands of retweets and comments as social media users ponder what transpired. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-844860" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201001_200025.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201001_200025.jpg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201001_200025-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201001_200025-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201001_200025-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/20201001_200025-80x80.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px">

Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has noted the need to reform the Nigeria Police to be more civil to Nigerians. He also stated that the disbanding of the SARS unit by the Inspector General Police is in order. Atiku stated this after a private visit to former military President, General Ibrahim Babangida at his uphill residence in Minna, Niger State. According to him, the SARS unit is no longer operating based on what they are trained to do, adding that, he had already issued a press statement on his stand on the call for the ban of SARS. He said, ” The eventual banning of the unit by IGP Mohammed Adamu is in order. The Police, especially, the SARS unit, is no longer operating based on its mandate of securing the country and its citizens. “It is unfortunate that men of the Police who were trained to protect the citizens have now turned their guns against unarmed citizens.” On the purpose of his visit to IBB, Atiku told reporters that he came on a private visit. The former Vice President arrived at the Minna airport to meet with IBB at about 1.23 pm on a flight T7-AAA accompanied by his wife, Titi Abubakar and Senator Abdul Ningi. Atiku was received at the airport by former Niger Governor, Dr Mu’azu Babangida Aliyu and other PDP Chieftains in the state.

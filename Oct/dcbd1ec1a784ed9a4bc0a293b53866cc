Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello has warned Nigerian youths to resist the temptation of using the current situation in the country to seek an undemocratic change in leadership. The Governor warned that those interested in the presidency must wait till 2023 and go through democratic processes. Bello said this in his address to the protesting Nigerian youths on Monday, being his fifth address to the youths since the #EndSARS protests began. “It goes without saying that despite different levels of dissatisfaction with the status quo in our country among the citizenry, it is unwise to think that a change of leadership other than by clear-cut democratic means will be tolerated by citizens. “Those interested in Mr President’s seat must wait for 2023 and when it is finally up for grabs, they must present themselves to the Nigerian electorate, duly nominated as flag bearers for any party of their choice. It is as simple as that. Ditto for any other duly elected seat or office”, he said. Bello said the youths should end the ongoing protests and enter a roundtable with the government. The Governor said it was time leaders of the protesters came out to engage with the government, having demonstrated resilience and courage in making their demands known for over 10 days. “In like manner, the real leaders and spokespersons of these protests must also begin to ‘show face’ now to enable government at all levels know who to interface with “May I, therefore, request that the protesters give us people to engage with, especially on the timeliest schedules for calling it a day which accommodates all reasonable demands”, he said.

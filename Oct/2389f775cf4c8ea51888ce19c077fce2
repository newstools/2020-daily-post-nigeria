Players of the Nigerian national team will undergo COVID-19 tests, ahead of their Tuesday’s international friendly with Tunisia, Goal reports. Super Eagles stars were also assessed before last Friday’s game against Algeria. However, all medical tests for players and coaches returned negative. The next round of tests will take place on Monday. Last week, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) were forced to clarify claims that four players in the camp had contracted the virus before they took on the Desert Foxes. Ramy Bensebaini’s sixth-minute strike handed Algeria a 1-0 victory. Gernot Rohr’s men will be hoping for a better result when they take on Tunisia. Both teams last met at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations third-place play-off, with Odion Ighalo’s third-minute strike winning the game.

Prof. Pat Utomi, has narrated how the shooting incident at Lekki Toll Gate, Lagos State, happened last night. Mr. Utomi explained to Channels Television, how operatives opened fire at the #EndSARS protest venue in Lekki. The professor of political economy and management expert lives very close to the Toll Gate area where the protest has held peacefully for about two weeks. He said, “I live not very far from the Lekki Toll Gate and I was on the deck of the house and I was actually speaking to somebody in the United States.” The politician explained that he had just finished speaking with his diplomat friend in Lagos, analysing the 24hrs curfew imposed by the State government when the shooting started. “I just finished discussing that with this Nigerian diplomat and I was talking to somebody in the US when I heard the siren, and I was wondering siren? “It just kept going and suddenly I heard ‘pa pa pa pa pa pa’ – gunfire, and I said, ‘oh my God, they are shooting at these kids’. I could hear them saying, ‘kneel down, they are shooting at us,” Utomi added. He advised federal and state authorities to be very careful in addressing the issues raised by the protesting youths.

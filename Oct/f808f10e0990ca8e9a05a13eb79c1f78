Salihu Tanko Yakasai, Media Aide to the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has reacted to his suspension. Recall that Ganduje had suspended Yakasai for criticising President Muhammadu Buhari over the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, unit of the Nigeria Police Force, NPF. Yakasai, while responding to the anti-SARS protest had said the Buhari-led government had zero empathy for citizens. This led to the governor ordering his suspension. Yakasai’s suspension was made public by the state’s Commissioner for Information, Muhammad Garba. Garba, in the statement had said the aide was suspended for his unguarded utterances, adding that the suspension was with immediate effect. However, Yakasai, in a tweet thanked all those who reached out to him, following his suspension. “I want to sincerely extend my heartfelt appreciation to all those that supported me yesterday, particularly those that called, or sent messages through several platforms, and those on the Time Line. I was overwhelmed and I tried to reply to all but couldn’t. Thank you from the bottom of my heart,” he tweeted

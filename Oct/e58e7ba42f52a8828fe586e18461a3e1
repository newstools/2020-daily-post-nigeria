Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has singled out Chelsea goalkeeper, Eduoard Mendy for praise, following their 0-0 draw on Saturday. Speaking with the media, Solskjaer labelled Mendy as the “match winner”. In a tight game at Old Trafford, neither team produced many chances. United had two big chances through Marcus Rashford, but on each occasion, Mendy was on hand to keep the ball out. Solskjaer felt his side narrowly edged the contest and hailed the former Rennes keeper as the man of the match, feeling United would have got all three points but for the goalkeeper. “Two good teams, quality in either end of the pitch. You can see their keeper today, I think he’s the match winner,” Solskjaer told MUTV after the game. “Two fantastic saves from Marcus. The one in the second half, an unbelievable save, I’m standing just behind it and following it to the top corner. Great finish, great save. “The first one was well blocked with his right foot. So I think it’s an even game.”

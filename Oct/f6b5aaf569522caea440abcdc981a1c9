Hoodlums on Tuesday set ablaze a police station at Orile Iganmu area of Lagos State. Some unidentified men who are said to have hijacked the End SARS protest had stormed the area and set the police station on fire. As at the time of filing this report, the station is currently in flames. Meanwhile, hoodlums had also burnt down Ugbekun police station in Benin and released some prisoners. This led the Edo State Government to impose a 24-hour curfew across the state. See Video below… #EndSARS : Paid thugs have taken over our peaceful protests.

Masked hoodlums, numbering over fifty on Friday, invaded the secretariat of the Calabar South Local Government Area of Cross River State. The hoodlums, who stormed the secretariat on Friday, destroyed some property and went away with office items including furniture and other movable items in some offices. An eyewitness, who would not want his name mentioned, regretted the action of the hoodlums, noting that the suspects were criminals as they masked themselves so that people could not recognize them. “Why should they mask themselves if at all they were true End SARS protesters? The way they invaded the council made some of us scamper for safety as they brought out warring weapons to threaten workers,” he said. When DAILY POST contacted the Chairman of Calabar South local government Council, Esther Bassey on phone on Friday, she lamented the action of the hoodlums, noting that suspects have stolen valuable items belonging to the council “Some unknown masked people stormed our secretariat in Calabar South Local Government Area and carted away properties worth millions of naira. “These were not protesters, they wore masks. They were thieves. They carried away movable items. The looters looted furniture, electronics including computers. “Before the incident, the Commissioner for Environment had sent some people to clear our grasses in the secretariat but I told them that they have no right to come here and clear our grasses. “More importantly, we had already wedded the grasses and I asked why should the Commissioner for Environment send somebody to come to the Council to cut the grass and as that was not resolved, the next thing I saw was these people who masked themselves came in and started burning tyres, attacking and looting the council,” she narrated.

They should use their legs and not to go too far from their houses. “You people are supporting the protesters. They were showing on AIT News yesterday. With the supports you’re giving to the protesters, ‘dem no destroy media houses?’ We are trying to contain this thing. You people are adding to it.” When asked whether the incident actually occurred, DSP Onovwakpoyeya said, “He(Akpokona) was not attacked. “He told me that they blocked close to their place and I told him we are not only securing the Station, they’re securing other facilities.”

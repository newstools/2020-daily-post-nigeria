Saddened by atrocious activities of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, the lawmaker representing Toro Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Muda Lawal Umar, has lent his voice in the urgent need to overall the SARS unit of the Nigeria Police. Expressing discontent over conducts of some elements he described as “rogues”, among the Special Anti-Robbery Squad meant to tackle crimes and criminality, he said, some of them have been actively involved in brutality and all forms of human rights abuse of citizens. Speaking with DAILY POST on Tuesday, the lawmaker pointed out that, it wasn’t wrong for SARS to have been created in view of high rate of crime, but their activities bothering on extortion, illegal arrests and alleged gang raping of female victims gave rise to calling for scrapping. He said: It’s incomprehensible that SARS has turned out to be citizens’ lamentation as a result of atrocious activities of the unit, ranging from extortion, illegal arrests, molestation, harassments, illegal detention and kidnapping of innocent youth in Nigeria. “It appears that the rogue elements in the SARS unit of the Nigeria Police Force are adamant to change as lots of efforts have been put in place to reform the Police and raise its standards in recent times to no avail. “These rogue officers keep reducing the credibility of the Nigeria Police force with their nefarious activities.” The lawmaker decried that it was disheartening that officers of the police force who are sworn to protect the people and their properties have now become a menace to the citizens of our dear country. He opined that the federal government moves urgently to set up modalities to halt these reprehensible activities and restructure the unit to better perform its lawful duties of safe-guarding the lives and property of Nigerians. He revealed that there might be legislative intervention to reform the unit, if nothing was done urgently by the Federal Government.

Amidst the nationwide outcry against operatives of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on social media, Laureta Onochie has defended the dreaded police unit. On social media, Nigerians are speaking against the unit following recent shooting of an unarmed civilian in Delta State. The “ENDSARS hashtag” is trending on twitter and other social media platforms. Atiku Abubakar, Bukola Saraki and several celebrities have also joined the campaign in the past 48hours. Lauretta, in a tweet on Sunday, said, “We must stand by our national institutions while working to improve their effectiveness.” “I have no doubt that there are some staff of SARS who are unprofessional in their dealings with d public, same way we have unprofessionalism in d Army, Mainstream Police, Customs, Civil Service, Public Service, traders, Lawyers, Doctors, journalists, teachers, pastors, etc. “But what is going on now, is a COORDINATED ATTACK BY CYBER CRIMINALS joined by UNSUSPECTING INNOCENT CITIZENS. “This is not the first time. We must stand by our national institutions while working to improve their effectiveness. Thats what patriotism is about.
NO SENTIMENTS.” This position is quite contradictory to the position of the Minister for Sport and Youth, Sunday Dare who has been condemning SARS in the past 48hours. She restricted comments on the post, allowing only people she follows or handles she mentioned in the post.

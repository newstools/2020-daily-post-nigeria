Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, on Thursday, criticised President Muhammadu Buhari’s nationwide address to Nigerians on the End SARS protest in the country. Buhari spoke on the End SARS protests, violence and government actions. But Omokri is not impressed with Buhari, adding that the president slapped Nigerians in the face and added salt to injury. He tweeted: “General @MBuhari slapped Nigerians in the face. Added salt to injury. Accused us of taking his disbandment of SARS as “weakness”. “He showed his weakness by rehabilitating Boko Haram. He showed his wickedness by the #LekkiMassacre of peaceful #EndSARS protesters. VERY EMPTY SPEECH.”

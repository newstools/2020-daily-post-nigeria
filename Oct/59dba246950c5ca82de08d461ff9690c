Days after the palace of the Oba of Lagos, Rilwan Akiolu, was burgled, local priests have cursed the assailants. In a footage, they were heard invoking the gods to punish the attackers. Specific reference was made to those who took the monarch’s staff of office (Opa Ase) and other items. Speaking in Yoruba, the man that led the supplication wished the culprits bad luck. “All the individuals that gathered to steal the king’s staff of office, it shall never be well with them. May every good thing meant for them be redirected”, he said. The Opa Ase or Opa Oba is the symbol of authority of a traditional ruler. It was stolen on Wednesday when an irate mob stormed the palace. They carted away food supplies, household items, gadgets and even cooled off in the swimming pool. The whereabouts of Oba Akiolu, a former police officer, remains unknown. Akiolu was extracted by soldiers just before rampaging youths invade his residence. They marched to the palace after the Ebute Ero police post in Idumota was set ablaze. Video:

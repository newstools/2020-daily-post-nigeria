Popular media personality, Toke Makinwa has revealed that she tested positive for COVID-19. Toke in a post on her Instagram page said she tested positive two weeks ago and her experience with the deadly disease was not great. The fashion enthusiast while advising Nigerians that the disease is real noted that although she was yet to recover fully, she hopes that the worst days are over. She wrote, ”I have been missing in action for a bit guys, the last two weeks of my life have been pretty tough to handle. I tested positive for COVID-19 and my experience wasn’t great (I mean it’s Covid), shooting this Vlog was a lot as I am not a 100 percent yet but I’m hopeful the worst days are behind me. ”Covid is real guys, there is a second wave of the virus in town and it is spreading really fast. I can’t say for sure where I caught it but the worst thing for me was contact tracing. Having to call people I have been exposed to, to tell them to quarantine and trace people they have also been exposed to, the whole thing is a mess. I share my experience on the Vlog today which is late I know but please be patient with me, the road to recovery is a lot, I am tired all the time, I have a bit of memory loss and I’m trying to find out what day is what. ”Doesn’t help that Nigeria itself has gone through something in this time too. Health is the real wealth guys, please be safe out there. My birthday is in less than a week, I just want to be a 100 again. Covid is real, wear your mask and wash your hands always. ”

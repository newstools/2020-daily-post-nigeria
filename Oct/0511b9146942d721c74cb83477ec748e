Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has ordered the immediate closure of all schools in Ogun State from now till October 26, DAILY POST reports. The Governor disclosed this on Tuesday evening at a press conference he addressed at Okemosan, Abeokuta. Abiodun also ordered the ban of the operations of commercial motorcycles, popularly known as Okada in Ogun State tomorrow, October 21. According to the Governor, this became necessary following cases of violence that have arisen as a result of the ongoing End SARS protest across Ogun state. He expressed sadness that an officer of the Nigeria Customs Service was killed on Tuesday at Yewa South by some mob on Okada. According to him, his administration has identified with the protesters and has been doing all that was necessary to ensure their demands are met. He recalled how he ordered the release of some of the End SARS protesters who were arrested for vandalising public properties in Ogun State, saying he also ordered the Attorney General of the state to drop charges against them. However, he said while the genuine protesters have remained peaceful in their demonstrations, some hoodlums have hijacked the protest, causing violence, burning police stations, vandalising properties and mounting roadblocks to extort the public while preventing others from going about their normal businesses. Abiodun said he held a meeting with security chiefs in the state today where many options, including the imposition of curfew, were considered. However, he explained that other options were considered in place of a curfew.

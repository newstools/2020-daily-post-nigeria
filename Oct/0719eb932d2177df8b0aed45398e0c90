Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, has backed the protest against the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, and the newly-introduced Special Weapons and Tactics Team (SWAT). Adeboye said he was backing the youths protesting because they needed to be kept alive. The clergyman popular called Papa G. O among his followers, stated this in a tweet on his verified Twitter handle on Wednesday night. Adeboye said he supports to youth speak up for their rights. According to Adeboye: “Our daughters will not be able to prophesy and young men will not see visions if we don’t keep them alive. I support the youths in this peaceful protest as they “speak up” to #EndPoliceBrutality #EndSARS #ENDSWAT.” Nigerians across the country have been protesting against police brutality. The protest had led to the Inspector General of Police, IGP, Mohammed Adamu disbanding SARS and announcing a new formation, Special Weapons and Tactics Team (SWAT). However, Nigerians are saying they want a total reform of the force and not change of name. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-848651" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EkUHbp4WsAA2dfU.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="792" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EkUHbp4WsAA2dfU.jpg 640w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/EkUHbp4WsAA2dfU-242x300.jpg 242w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px">

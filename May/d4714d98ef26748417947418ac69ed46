Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, on Friday arrested 14 persons hidden in two trailers conveying cattle from Adamawa State to Port Harcourt, the State’s capital. Wike told reporters that the trailers were intercepted following a tip-off from well-meaning Nigerians, who told the State authorities that some Northerners were making their way into Port Harcourt. The Governor ordered the prosecution of the 14 persons who were arrested at Rumuigbo in Obio/Akpor Local Government area of the State. They will be tried by the mobile court and undergo COVID-19 tests by the State Ministry of Health. “This fight has nothing to do with individuals. The law must take its course. You are aware of what is happening and then some people want to illegally smuggle persons into the state. “Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor are under lockdown and the law must be obeyed. The trailers and the cows will be auctioned tomorrow”, Wike said. “You heard them saying that they gave money to the security agencies before they were allowed to cross the border. The owner of the cattle in a phone interview said they have fallen short of the law”, he added. The governor said that people must be alive to eat cow; hence, the lockdown to protect the lives of Rivers people. Wike cried out that some people were desperate to smuggle people into the State, but maintained that his administration would remain vigilant, despite the challenges it was facing. Ahmed Aliyu, one of the defaulters, said that they were contracted from Adamawa State to bring cattle to one Alhaji in Oyigbo Local Government Area area of the State. Aliyu also alleged that before they were allowed into the state they bribed security personnel with N1500.

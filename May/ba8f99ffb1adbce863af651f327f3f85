Anambra, Enugu and Akwa Ibom States led the COVID-19 recovery rate in Nigeria in the month of April. This followed a study of Case Fatality Rates (CFR) and Case Recovery Rate (CRR) essential for assessing effects of the pandemic. While CFR is the number of deaths divided by the number of cases, CRR is the number of recoveries divided by the number of cases. In its report released on Sunday, Emergency Digest analysed the CFR and CRR based on the official data provided by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). At the last day of the month reviewed, Nigeria had 1,932 confirmed cases, 319 discharged and 58 dead. The overall fatality rate in April was 3 percent while the recovery rate was 16.5 percent. The CFR and CRR were calculated for each state and Abuja, except Kogi and Cross River with no case yet. On the recovery rate, Anambra State had 100 percent CRR as the only confirmed case recovered. Enugu has 66.7 percent – two out of three patients recovered; Akwa Ibom scored 62.5 percent – ten out of sixteen recovered. Other CRR in states are Osun 53 percent, Delta 44 percent, Oyo 39 percent and Ondo 33 percent. At the bottom of the CRR table is Kano. The state had 219 cases as at April 30 with no confirmed recovery. Other states with high cases but zero recovery are Gombe, Borno and Katsina. On the CFR, Zamfara has 25 percent – one death from four cases; Delta 22 percent – two deaths from nine cases; Kwara 18 percent – two deaths from eleven cases.

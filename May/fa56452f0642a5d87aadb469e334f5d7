The Edo State Government has ordered the immediate shutdown of Lagos Street, an epicenter of trade and commerce in Benin metropolis, to check the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the state. Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, in a statement sent to DAILY POST said, the decision to shut down trading/business activities on Lagos Street, close to Oba ovonramwen square followed the refusal of residents to comply with the state government’s directives to participate in the ongoing screening and testing exercise for COVID-19, as part of efforts to contain the pandemic. According to him, “Lagos Street will remain closed to activities until residents in the area take part in the exercise to protect themselves and other members of the public, The participation of all residents in the exercise is important in curtailing the spread of the virus in the state. “Being a business hub, a large number of residents in Benin City and other parts of the state visit Lagos Street daily for various activities making the area a hotspot for the spread of COVID-19. This makes it important for residents and other persons in the area to participate in the exercise. Lagos Street will remain closed to all forms of activities until the residents participate in the screening and testing exercise he added.

Inter Milan manager, Antonio Conte, has backed Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard’s decision to play midfielder, N’Golo Kante in a more advanced midfield role for the Blues. Kante joined Chelsea from Leicester City for £30 million in Conte’s first summer at Stamford Bridge. The 29-year-old played a key role in helping Chelsea to win the Premier League title in 2017 as he was the anchor in Conte’s midfield. But the France World Cup winner was moved further forward during former Chelsea manager, Maurizio Sarri’s reign at the West London club as the 61-year-old Italian preferred midfielder, Jorginho at the heart of his midfield. “In my opinion, N’Golo Kante can play in every position in midfield,” Conte told Sky Sports. “We are talking about an amazing player, a top player. He’s fantastic with the ball and without the ball. “When you have N’Golo in your team, you can think you are playing with one more extra player. “You can find a smile on his face every day, and he is a very positive guy, one of the best players I have had in my career as a coach.” EPL: Lampard told best position to play Chelsea star, Kante Ndidi addresses comparison between himself, Chelsea’s N’Golo Kante EPL: What Guardiola said about Lampard, Chelsea after 2-1 win

The Acting Chief Judge of Cross River State, Justice Maurice Eneji, has released 30 inmates from the Correctional Service Centre in Afokang as part of efforts to decongest prisons in the state. While releasing the inmates, Eneji said the release was in line with the directive of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad and Gov. Ben Ayade to curb the spread of the ravaging global pandemic. “Some of the inmates released were those charged for minor offences like theft, trespass, mischief, while some were set free on health grounds. “Others who have spent beyond their prescribed period of jail terms for offences committed also benefited from the exercise of decongesting the Correctional Centre,” he said. The Acting CJ also used the opportunity to commend the Director of Public Persecution, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGO’s), Human Rights Commission and Learned Counsels for their efforts in the exercise.

The Igbo socio-cultural organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has advised Northern leaders not to resurrect the Almajiri institution even after COVID-19. Ohanaeze claimed that the institution was thoroughly abused by some northern power brokers, urging leaders of Northern extraction to rehabilitate the Almajiris rather than encourage them to flee to the South. This is as security operatives attached to the COVID-19 lockdown enforcement team in Abia State intercepted a truckload of Almajiris to the state. In a statement to newsmen in Umuahia, on Monday, the Spokesman of the Igbo body, Chuks Ibegbu, warned against any attempt by the unscrupulous Boko Haram elements to take advantage of the Almajiri movement to the South to perpetrate any violence as they will be decimated if such acts are suspected. “Nobody should test our(citizens) will in any form. We call on the federal government to ensure the COVID-19 lockdown palliatives and support is spread equitably round the country. The Abacha loot should be properly disbursed; we wonder how the Late Military dictator could steal this kind of public funds undetected”. Ohanaeze also insisted that an Igbo man should succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 for justice, equity and fair play. It called on all political stakeholders in Nigeria to ensure the Presidency is zoned to Igbo extraction come next general elections. Ohanaeze further restated it’s full commitment to the restructuring of Nigeria as that will be the ultimate panacea to her multifarious challenges.

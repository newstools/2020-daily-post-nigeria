The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has suspended the redeployment of personnel who participated in “Bop Daddy Challenge”. DAILY POST had reported that the Service in April issued a query to female officers after the viral video. Also, the officers, Priscilla Irabor, Binti Attabor, Catherine Bakura, Blessing Udida and Blessing Udida were on Wednesday redeployed to Kano, Yobe, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Borno States, respectively. They were also instructed to bear the cost of their redeployment. However, a statement on the Service’s official Twitter page on Friday said the matter was still under investigation and therefore, the Comptroller General had ordered that the earlier posting be put on hold “It is important to note that staff deployment remains a vital practice of regimented organizations such as ours and should be seen as such. As an agency, we maintain zero tolerance to any matters bordering on offences against discipline among members of our workforce irrespective of gender,” it said. The statement added that the service encourages staff development and personal efforts but it must be within the confines of its rules and regulation. “The matter involving the Personnel in question is still being investigated and therefore, the Comptroller General has directed that the earlier Posting Order be put on hold pending the conclusion of the investigation,” it noted.

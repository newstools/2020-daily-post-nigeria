Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has said Nigeria’s economy is going into a state of depression. The governor said all the states are presently dealing with very difficult situation as they battle COVID-19 pandemic. El-Rufai said this while speaking to State House correspondents on Friday at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, NAN reports. “The economy is going to go into depression; there is nothing we can do about that; revenues have collapsed; yet you still have to invest in more public health facilities. “Most of the leaders have to invest in treatment despite the condition and weighed to invest in security.” He added that it is a difficult time for those at the leadership positions even as he called on all leaders to work in unity. “This time is a very difficult time to be in a leadership position and that is why the people and the leaders must all work together and pray for God to end this Coronavirus pandemic. “It is a major problem, but we are working together,” El-rufai added. The Kaduna Governor, however, added that Nigeria will surely overcome as a resilient nation.

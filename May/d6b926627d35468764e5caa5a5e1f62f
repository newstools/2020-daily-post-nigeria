The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN, in Edo State, has called on the state government to reopen churches. PFN explained that reopening churches in the state would help create more awareness on how to curb COVID-19. The body said churches would embark on aggressive intercession for divine intervention against coronavirus if they are reopened. In a communique issued at the end of it’s executive committee meeting, PFN described COVID-19 as an evil plague. It said churches should reopen in full compliance with the state’s extant guidelines. The communique was signed by chairman, Bishop Mon Igbinosa, second deputy chairman, Evangelist M.A. Agbonifo. Vice-chairman (Edo South), Rev. Solomon Imariagbe and Secretary, Rev. Solomon O. Udi. It also commended the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki, for his efforts towards tackling the spread of the virus in the state. The communique reads: “PFN is not unaware of the efforts of the state chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN and the efforts of churches to be closed for two weeks to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria and Edo State, the markets are allowed to run, and the populace are also allowed to move about to a reasonable extent which is commendable. “Reopening the churches will assist government’s efforts in a number of ways. The Pulpit will increase awareness of COVID-19 and the churches will embark on aggressive intercession for divine intervention to terminate this evil plague that has so far defied human solution.” PFN also lamented what it described as unwholesome harassment of pastors and church members who opened their churches, following the declaration by the governor. The body consequently called for the cessation of unlawful harassment of pastors in the state.

The Katsina State Government has announced the discharge of 51 coronavirus patients after a successful treatment. The state Permanent Secretary and member of the COVID-19 Committee, Dr Kabiru Mustapha, made the disclosure to journalists on Thursday while giving an update on the COVID-19 situation in the State. Mustapha also said that 13 deaths linked to coronavirus complications have been recorded in the State. According to him, five out of the late coronavirus patients were admitted in the State’s isolation center, while the remaining 8 were based on the symptomatic observations carried out and outcome of a medical test conducted on their samples after they died. He said “As it is, the COVID-19 Committee now holds their meetings through the zones and there is no point to connect everybody at the moment. “We really are in a very serious position, there are a lot of cases now to handle. “I am just coming from the IDP Centre, if you go there you see people being trained on how to manage the facilities. “We are doing training for the handlers, ward attendants and other personnel.” However, he said that as at Thursday, 285 positive cases have been recorded in the state and 300 samples are yet to be returned.

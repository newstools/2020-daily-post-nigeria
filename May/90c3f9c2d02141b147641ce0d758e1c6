The Federal Government has disclosed that it’s considering reopening schools amid the coronavirus pandemic. Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, disclosed that federal government was considering morning and afternoon classes when it reopens schools across the country. Nwajiuba made the disclosure while speaking at the daily press briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja. He explained that the government could not afford to risk the safety of students across the country. “We may have classes in the morning and classes in the afternoon so that we will have the whole of the infrastructure divided provided they can serve us. “I am not sure we will have classes at night. But we can do with morning and afternoon for now,” he said. The Minister said the decision was based on advice from experts as well as those of the World Health Organisation, WHO. Recall that the minister had last week assured Nigerians that Federal Government was working towards reopening schools amid the pandemic.

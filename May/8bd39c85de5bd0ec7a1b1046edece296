All Real Madrid players have tested negative for COVID-19, ESPN reports. The squad underwent testing at their Valdebebas training ground on Wednesday alongside manager Zinedine Zidane, his assistants and other key staff. This clears the way for the Madrid squad to begin individual training sessions Monday morning, ahead of a possible resumption of games in LaLiga. The players had been training at home since Real Madrid City was quarantined on March 12, when the club’s basketball player Trey Thompkins tested positive. Earlier this week the facilities at Valdebebas were cleaned and prepared for use. “Everything has been measured to the millimeter and studied carefully,” a club employee told ESPN.

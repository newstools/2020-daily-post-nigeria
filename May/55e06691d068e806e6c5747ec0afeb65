Following recent attacks by suspected Fulani militia in Kajuru communities in Kaduna State, the Global Peace Foundation of Nigeria, has donated relief materials to persons displaced by conflict in the area. Many of the homeless were displaced by gunmen who invaded Gonar Rogo village on May 12. The Country Director of GPF, Rev. John Hayab and the Northern Coordinator, Sheikh Haliru-Maraya who presented the relief items to the IDPs urged victims of the attack to shun reprisals. Hayab stressed that villagers must explore options of peaceful dialogue to ensure sustainable peace. He said as one family under God, the group’s mission is to preach the gospel of peace and forgiveness, adding that retaliation is not an option. “We know you may have lost your loved ones and property but please don’t retaliate.” He observed that revenge always creates instability and hatred but enjoined them to give peace a chance. Hayab appealed to the state government to take drastic measures that would stop barbaric killings and bring perpetrators of the crime to book. Responding, Mr Patrick Maigari, Kajuru local government area Chairman of the Peace and Reconciliation Committee, urged people in the area to be calm, assuring that the government was making concerted efforts to check the menace. He added that already security agencies have been drafted to the area to ensure peace and security.

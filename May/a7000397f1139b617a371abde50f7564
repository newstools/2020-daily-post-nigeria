Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, has expressed sadness and pain over the demise of a retired Supreme Court jurist, Justice Adolphus Karibi-Whyte. Amaechi, in a statement on Saturday in Abuja, referred to the deceased as `a father and a great advisor’. The Professor of Law and author died on Friday. During his time as Governor of Rivers State, Amaechi appointed Karibi-Whyte Pro-Chancellor of the Rivers State University of Science and Technology (RSUST) to strengthen the institution’s education and values. The minister said: “Justice Karibi-Whyte, for me, was a father figure. He was an exemplary personality, a great advisor, and I have the utmost respect for him. “During his tenure as Pro Chancellor of RSUST where he brought his astute disposition and intellect to bear, there was a remarkable turnaround in the quality of education and handling of affairs in the institution. “He was also a key member of the State’s Economic Advisory Council when I was governor, and my administration and Rivers State benefited richly from his wealth of experience and expertise. “As a Justice of the Supreme Court, he was very upright, fearless and upheld the rule of law. “ He was a colossus and great teacher. I will miss him deeply. Rivers State and Nigeria just lost a good man, a great man,” he said. Amaechi prayed for the repose of the soul of the departed Justice and comfort for his wife and the entire family.

Manchester United could be without Odion Ighalo for their remaining fixtures, as Shanghai Shenhua expects him to return from his loan spell by July, according to Sky Sports. Ighalo has impressed in his short spell at Old Trafford since joining the club on loan in January, but his deal expires next month. United was optimistic about extending that date, to allow for the delay in completing the Premier League season due to COVID-19. However, Ighalo could now be summoned back at the end of his loan deal, as Shenhua want him ready for the start of the Chinese Super League season. The only way United could keep the 30-year-old would now be to pay the Â£20million price tag on his head.

Some Imo State House of Assembly members were on Tuesday shut out of the Assembly premises by security agents who claimed they were being owed up to 5 months allowance. DAILY POST gathered that the security personnel had insisted that unless their allowance was given to them, the plenary would not hold. They further alleged that the Chiji Collins-led Imo Assembly has often turned deaf ears to their repeated appeals on the issue, warning them to do the needful or expect more disgrace from them. The situation, according to reports, was, however, calmed by the intervention of the Assembly Clerk, Chinelo Emeghara who promised to look into it. Speaking with the member representing Oru-west state constituency, Dominic Ezerioha, he said nothing of such took place, admitting, however, that the House has some remuneration to make to the security agents. The lawmaker who is the House Committee chairman on Information and Judiciary further said that whatever move the security agents at the Assembly have taken may be what they believed was the most workable means of pressing home their demand, adding that plenary was held the same day without let or hindrance.

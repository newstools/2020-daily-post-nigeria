FIFA will approve an increase from three to five substitutions per match, when football returns amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Referees, chief, Nicola Rizzoli, feels football’s governing body will accommodate the requests of individual associations. It is believed that an increase in replacements, will reduce the strain on players with fixture lists across the globe set to become more congested. Games will also be played in higher temperatures than normal, with the Premier League hoping to restart in June and continue throughout the summer. “I believe FIFA intend to allow five substitutions. “In a phase of the season with many games one after the other and in elevated temperatures, we’ll have to all take a step forward to help everyone,” Rizzo, who reffed the 2014 World Cup final, told Sky Italia. Rizzo also revealed the changes referees will need to make, including a reduction in the number of officials in the VAR booth – and the protective equipment they will need to wear.

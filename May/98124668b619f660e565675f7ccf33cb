The Federal Government of Nigeria has said the vaccine for COVID-19, may not be ready until 2021. The Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, stated this on Tuesday during the daily briefing. According to him, Nigeria has turned to native solutions for treatment, like other countries in the world. Mustapha, who is also the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, also appealed to local researchers to be patient and subject their drugs through the protocol of validation. “Ordinarily, from the little literature I have read on COVID 19, is that we are not expecting any vaccine to be on the shelves until towards the end of 2021. “My encouragement to our people, to our researchers and those that are involved in the processes of manufacturing drugs, especially our home-grown cure, they should be patient and they should run it through a process. That is the only way we can have it validated,” he said.

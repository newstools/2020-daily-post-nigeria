The legal practitioner said, “I dare tell you too. There is a remedy. Once a right is breached, the Constitution empowers you to immediately sue them for the restoration of your rights.” Omon-Irabor said the Journalists also write to inform the police of whatever wrongs that have been done to them through the Police Service Commission. “You tell them that you’re entitled to a public apology in a Nigerian widely read newspaper. After that, you’re entitled to compensation. There’s no way there is a wrong without a remedy. So, once you’ve been wronged, there must be a remedy.” He said Group urges IGP to thoroughly investigate attempted murder, kidnap of Warri Journalist, Cletus Opukeme Rights group condemns unlawful arrest of DAILY POST Correspondent in Delta Court strikes out fake pastor's N2Billion suit against Delta CP, DPO for lack of merit

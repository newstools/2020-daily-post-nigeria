The Gombe State Government, on Thursday, lifted the ban placed on religious activities. Recall that on Wednesday, April 22 the ban was imposed to curb the spread COVID-19 in the State. However, Governor Muhammad Inuwa Yahaya, after a meeting with religious leaders on Thursday, directed that all congregational activities for social, cultural and religious purposes regardless of the number of persons participating in such events should equally be suspended. Inuwa said places of worship must adhere to social distancing policy. He warned that failure to adhere to social distancing order, use of face masks, frequent handwashing with soap and water would lead to re-imposition of the ban. According to him, the ban had yielded results by helping to contain community spread of the virus. He added that the religious leaders had given assurances that they would comply with all Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC)â€™s protocols on the COVID-19 while opening Mosques and Churches across the state.

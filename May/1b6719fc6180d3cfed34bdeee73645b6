Nigeria’s Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, has insisted that there is no evidence yet, that the mysterious deaths in Kano state were caused by COVID-19. Ehanire stated this on Tuesday while addressing the House of Representatives. According to him, the investigation to ascertain the cause of the deaths is still ongoing. The coordinator of the presidential task force on COVID-19 in Kano, Sani Gwarzo, told reporters on Sunday that “most of the deaths recorded of recent and tests carried out showed that coronavirus was the cause.” However, while addressing lawmakers, Ehanire said “there was never a case of him (the task force coordinator) saying 80 percent of people died from that or any other disease at all. “The person did not say that the people died from coronavirus.”

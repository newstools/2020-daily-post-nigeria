A member representing Ethiope Federal Constituency in Delta State at the House of Representatives, Ben Ibakpa, yesterday alleged that some Nigerian officials signed loan documents from China written in Chinese language. The lawmaker made the claims when he appeared on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme. He further claimed that Nigeria’s legislative arm is not carried along when the country takes loans from China. The Delta-born politician said, “The national assembly was kept in the dark in all these loans. “The National Assembly is not part of it. Even the Bureau for Public Procurement is not aware of these loans. “These loans are collected via the China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC). They bring a bill, the Federal executive approves the bill.” He claimed that “from what we have seen from other countries, the Chinese loans are overpriced and these people are very corrupt.” Ibakpa pointed out that some Nigerian officials do not look into loan documents critically before signing, adding that “Some of these agreements that are signed, they come in Chinese language.” $22.7b loan: Court told to stop President Buhari immediately SERAP drags FG to court over failed $460m Abuja CCTV project Real reason Buhari is seeking re-approval of NASS on external borrowing plan

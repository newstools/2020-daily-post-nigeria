The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has reduced interest rates on its facilities through participating Other Financial Institutions (OFIs). The rate has been slashed from 9 to 5 percent per for one year, effective March 1, 2020. This was contained in a circular to banks on Wednesday by the Director of Financial Policy and Regulation Department, Kevin Amugo. Similarly, CBN intervention facilities obtained through participating OFIs, Microfinance Banks (MFBs), Primary Mortgage Banks, among others would be given a further one-year moratorium on all principal repayments. This is also effective March 1, 2020. OFIs have equally been granted leave to consider temporary and time limited restructuring of the tenor and loan terms for households and businesses, subject to the recently issued guidelines for restructuring affected credit facilities in the OFI sub-sector. The Director, Corporate Communications Department, Isaac Okoroafor, said the decisions were part of the bankâ€™s efforts to cushion the effects of coronavirus on Nigerians, businesses and regulated institutions. He assured that the CBN would also continue to monitor developments and implement appropriate measures to safeguard financial stability and support stakeholders impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting of the CBN for the month of May will be held on Thursday.

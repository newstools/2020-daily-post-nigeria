Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma has been charged to probe his predecessors and recover every penny alleged to have been stolen by them. The Elders Council in the state gave the charge today during a meeting with the speaker of the state House of Assembly, Chiji Collins at the complex, Owerri. Speaking, Edmund J.K Onyebuchi, the state chairman of the council assured the Assembly of their council’s unalloyed support in bringing the past governments to proper scrutiny. He said, “we are senior citizens of the state and are not afraid of anybody. When things are going wrong, we shout at the top of our voices. ” “We have come to tell you that we are totally in support of the ongoing move to probe past governments. We urge the Assembly and Governor Hope Uzodinma not to delay in carrying out the probe.” “No one is above the law, if anybody, no matter how highly placed, is found wanton in embezzling state funds, they will be made to face the music.” “Therefore we urge the Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma to move on in the probe and he has our total support.” However, he asked that the probe be extended to past Governors of the state no matter whose ox is gored. In a related development, the House has constituted a committee for Projects Monitoring and Evaluation. DAILY POST learned that the Committee as headed by the Deputy Speaker and member representing Nwangele state constituency, Amarachi Chyna Iwuanyanwa will take inventory of the state government’s road contracts awarded from former Governor, Ikedi Ohakim to Emeka Ihedioha, to evaluate them and ascertain reasons for some abandoned projects in the state.

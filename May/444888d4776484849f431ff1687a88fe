The Bundesliga is set to become Europe’s first major football league to resume fixtures during the COVID-19 pandemic. On Wednesday, a restart was confirmed for later this month. Germany’s government and its federal states have given the green light to start again. However, the date is due to be decided, when the German Football League (DFL) meets for an Ordinary Assembly on Thursday. May 15 has been pencilled down as the earliest possible return date, with a May 22 start also considered. There are nine round of games left, with a commitment to finish the season by June 30 and Bayern Munich lead the Bundesliga by four points. “Today’s decision is good news for the Bundesliga and the Bundesliga 2. “It is associated with a great responsibility for the clubs and their employees to implement the medical and organisational requirements in a disciplined manner,” Christian Seifert, chief executive of the DFL, said.

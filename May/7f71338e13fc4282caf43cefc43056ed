Kennie Obateru, NNPC’s Group General Manager, Public Affairs Division, said the price was reduced to make more sales while complying with the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency’s (PPPRA) price template. “We reviewed the ex-depot price to enable us to make more sales. For AGO, it is a deregulated product and as such is its prices are determined by market forces,” he added.

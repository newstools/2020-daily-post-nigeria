The General Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church, formerly known as Latter Rain Assembly, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has called on church leaders to donate buildings to be used as isolation centres, instead of continually criticizing the government. In a broadcast shared by the church on Sunday, Bakare revealed he has donated facilities in Lagos and Ogun, to be used. “Those churches with multiple facilities, rather than their leaders criticizing the government, should collaborate with them. “They must be prepared to offer some of their halls to governmental authorities as isolation centres in support of the efforts of the government,” Bakare said. Bakare’s position is in contrast with the opinion held by the presiding bishop of Living Faith Worldwide, David Oyedepo. Oyedepo has questioned the ban on religious gatherings amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He claimed that the “voice of darkness” influenced the ban on gatherings in churches.

He said that the Federal Government would continue to adopt and implement practical measures to ensure that the projected growth in the MSMEs sector was not seriously affected by the development. “Of importance to the government’s response was to find ways of not just giving succour and assistance to existing MSMEs but also ensuring that there is a practical and active stimulus to new MSMEs. ”So that the growth of this sector is not discouraged by the current economic trauma. “This is our moment, and the government of Nigeria and its regulatory agencies are prepared to back MSMEs and other businesses that are prepared for the innovative and interesting times that lie ahead of us.” Osinbajo charges govt agencies to do more in poverty reduction 7.5 per cent increase in VAT remains lowest in Africa - Osinbajo FG moves to secure $500m AFDB fund

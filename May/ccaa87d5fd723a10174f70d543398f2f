The founder of Inri Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has predicted that the vaccine for COVID-19 will be discovered in July this year. Scientists around the world are yet to make a breakthrough with regards to a cure for the virus, since it broke out earlier this year in Wuhan, China. In the last weeks, more countries, including Nigeria are tilting towards the use of the antiviral drug, Remdesivir, to treat Coronavirus patients. However, there is still no widely accepted vaccine for COVID-19, as Japan prepares to approve another medication, Avigan. Primate Ayodele feels a breakthrough will happen in the next two months. “Between May and July, the number of infected people would increase to 10,000. “The vaccine will come out around July but it would have wreaked havoc,” he said according to the Daily Sun.

Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said he may be forced to lock down the state again, if residents continue to ignore public health guidelines. President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday, May 4, eased the five-week lockdown he imposed on Lagos, Ogun and Abuja to check the spread of COVID-19. However, there have been chaos and rowdy scenes, since residents were allowed to move freely. Sanwo-Olu speaking at a press briefing today, expressed his unhappiness over the crowd observed at various banks and markets across the state. “As a Government elected to uphold security of its citizens, which include health security, we will not hesitate to review the terms of the easing of lockdown if we do not see an improvement in adherence to our public health guidelines in the next couple of days,” he said. “We will be forced to take a painful decision of bringing the entire system under lockdown if we continue to see evidence that Lagosians are determined to flout the rules.” Lagos still has the highest number of confirmed cases in Nigeria with 1,683.

Deontay Wilder has asked for up to $10million (Â£8.1m) and a guarantee he will face the winner of Tyson Fury vs Anthony Joshua before he can step aside from his third fight with Fury, The Athletic reports. Fury outclassed Wilder in their second bout, after the first fight ended in a controversial draw. A clause in their contract, however, ensured a triology was on the table. However, there has been a clamour for an all-British unification bout, with Fury and Joshua holding all the heavyweight belts. But it would need Wilder and Kubrat Pulev, who was scheduled to fight Joshua in June before COVID-19 outbreak, to step aside. Pulev has previously admitted he would entertain a step-aside offer in order to make that happen and is is believed Wilder will also be willing to consider a proposal.

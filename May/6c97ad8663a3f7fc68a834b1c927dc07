The World Bank has approved $48million to help Uganda fight a desert locust invasion threatening citizens. The money was released under the Emergency Locust Response Programme. This will help Uganda monitor and manage locust swarms to limit the growth of existing and new desert locust populations. It will also provide livelihood protection and restoration to the affected households, communities and vulnerable groups. “The project is expected to support 950,000 direct beneficiaries and about 1.2 million indirect beneficiaries in the locust-affected districts,’’ World Bank said in a statement on Thursday. The institution expressed concern that the outbreak could undermine development gains, threaten food security as well as livelihoods of millions of Ugandans. Uganda has deployed over 2,000 soldiers and 835 civilian personnel, including agriculture extension workers, to contain the locusts.

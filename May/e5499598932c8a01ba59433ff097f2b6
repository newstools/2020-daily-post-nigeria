Former Arsenal captain, Cesc Fabregas, has disclosed that he made his former Gunners teammate, Nwankwo Kanu, angry during their time at Emirates. Fabregas, who currently plays for Monaco in the French Ligue 1, joined Arsenal as a teenager in 2003 from Barcelona. The Spain international was highly rated by former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger. According to the 33-year-old, while trying to impress Wenger and his teammates in his first training at the North London club, he tackled Kanu, which made the Nigerian legend unhappy. “My first training when I joined Arsenal, I was all in my head trying to impress, and I made a tackle on Kanu, and he was so upset with me,” Fabregas told Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry, during an Instagram live video. “When you are young, sometimes you do not think; you just want to go there and prove yourself without realising that you are playing alongside World Cup winners. “At that moment you just want to do your best, and most times, the passion gets the best out of you.” Both players featured for Arsenal for one season before Kanu left for Portsmouth in 2004, after spending five years at the club. Fabregas went on to become a club legend at Arsenal, scoring 57 goals and registering 92 assists in 304 appearances before he left the club for Barcelona in 2011.

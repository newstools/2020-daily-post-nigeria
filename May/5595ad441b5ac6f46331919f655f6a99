The American government has approved emergency use of Remdesivir, an experimental drug for treating Coronavirus patients, as more states in the US ease lockdowns despite the increase in deaths from the disease. DAILY POST reported that the US National Institute of Health on Wednesday said that an experimental drug, Remdesvir, has proved effective against the new Coronavirus disease. US President, Donald Trump made the announcement on Friday at the White House alongside,Stephen Hahn, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, (FDA), stating that the drug would be available for patients hospitalized with Coronavirus. It was reported that those given the drugs were able to leave the hospital in 11 days on average versus 15 days for the comparison group. According to a doctor from the US National Institutes of Health, Dr Anthony Fauci, the drug would become a new standard of care for severely COVID-19 patients like those in this study. Fauci said that the drug has not been tested on people with milder illness, and currently is given through an IV in a hospital.

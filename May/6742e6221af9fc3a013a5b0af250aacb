The World Health Organisation (WHO) Regional Director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, on Tuesday, commended midwives across the continent for their commitment to ensuring the safety of mothers and their newborn babies. Moeti disclosed this in a statement issued by the WHO African Regional Office in Brazzaville, Congo, to commemorate the International Day of Midwives today (May 5). She hailed the commitment of Midwives in ensuring the safety of mothers and their newborn babies even during the challenging period of the Coronavirus pandemic across the world. According to Moeti, between 2000 and 2017, maternal and newborn deaths have declined by 40 percent in Africa. She said: “Thanks largely to the commitment of midwives working with other health professionals. “However, one in two (53 percent) of African midwives have reported feeling disrespected by fellow health workers in the course of their work. “We must, therefore, do more to appreciate the valuable contributions of midwives in health care teams. “Countries are making strides to improve the skills and working environment for midwives.” Moeti added: “In the COVID-19 response, we are training nurses and midwives in infection prevention and control, to limit the transmission of Coronavirus in health facilities. “So far, over 3000 front-line health workers, including midwives, have participated in webinars. “These activities complement training led by chief nurses and midwifery officers in countries. “Countries are also making sure essential health services, like safe deliveries, are not disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic.” Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Africa as of today is over 46,500, according to WHO.

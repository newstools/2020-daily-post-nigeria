President Muhammadu Buhari’s yet-to-be announced Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari, has arrived the Aso Villa in Abuja. He is expected to be announced today. On Tuesday, the Emir of Ilorin, Mai-Martaba, Ibrahim Sulu-Gambari, had thanked Buhari for the “appointment”. The Chairman, Kwara State Council of Chiefs, expressed gratitude in a statement by his spokesman, Abdulazeez Arowona. But the presidency is yet to publicly confirm or deny the appointment.  The monarch described Gambari’s emergence as a great honour to the entire people of Ilorin Emirate and Kwarans. Gambari noted that Buhari’s choice has a remarkable administrative experience. The monarch wished him a successful tenure in office. “He will surely bring to fore his wealth of experience as an academician, former Minister, former Diplomat, former University Chancellor, Prince of the renown Alimi dynasty, family man and community leader of high repute,” it read. Gambari is the Wambai of Ilorin Emirate. The diplomat was Minister for External Affairs between 1984 and 1985. He was chairman of the Joint African Union-United Nations Special Representative for Darfur in 2010.

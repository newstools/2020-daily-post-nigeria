Former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi, has said that there is a need to do more work in Nigeria as coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread across the country. Obi said this on Monday in an interview on MONEY LINE with Nancy, which was aired on AIT. He noted that Nigeria is still not in control of the most critical measure of how the virus is spreading, which is testing. According to Obi: “We have not really taken care or control of the [COVID-19] situation in Nigeria as it should be because the most critical measure of how this is spreading we are still not in control of it, which is testing. “For me, the issue of lockdown and relaxing it, we all still have to go through this very serious precaution and follow strict protocols. “Because where South Africa said they are in control of the situation in their country, here in Nigeria, the virus is in control of the situation. “We do not know what is happening. There is a need to do more work.” Meanwhile, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has announced another 248 new cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, bringing to 4,399 confirmed cases in the country as of Sunday night.

The World Trade Organisation (WTO) Director-General, Roberto Azevedo, has announced that he would step down from his position. He would leave on August 31 after seven years at the helm. Azevedo’s decision came more than a year before his second term as WTO head was due to end. The United States, in December, blocked WTO’s ability to settle disputes by blocking the appointment of judges to its appellate body. Reuters quoted Simon Evenett, professor of international trade and economic development as saying the next WTO head must command respect in the corridors of power of the major players. “This is not the time to promote another ambassador. Someone with very senior government experience or global status is needed”, said Evenett, who teaches at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland.

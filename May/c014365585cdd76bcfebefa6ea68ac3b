The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has kicked against the bill on Infectious Disease Control before the House of Representatives. CAN, in a statement on Tuesday by General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, queried “the rush” to allow the bill to be passed into law with jet speed. “The question in the hearts of many people is this: Why the rush when the vaccine is not available yet?,” they quipped. The Christian leadership gave reasons it was against the moves by the Nigerian lawmakers. CAN said the bill “was initiated to destroy the Civil and Human Rights of Nigerians; that it prevents Nigerians from having a say in their own affairs. “Among this denial of the fundamental human rights are: right to life, personal liberty, freedom from inhuman treatment, privacy, right to acquire/own property, freedom of movement and religion. “These rights are held sacred and invaluable except on clearly defined occasions as provided for by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” CAN reminded the federal legislators that the courts in Nigeria, on numerous occasions, struck out Acts of Parliaments and Legislation including Executive Orders of Governments, that were against fundamental human rights. The body told them to “allow the Spirit of God to prevail over the primordial intentions and ambition; not to pass this controversial, nebulous and obnoxious bill into law in the overall interest of Nigerians”. Also on Tuesday, Civil Society Organisations in Nigeria raised an alarm that the House of Representatives was acting too fast in its bid to pass the bill.

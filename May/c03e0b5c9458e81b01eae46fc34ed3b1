President Muhammadu Buhari has made a u-turn on the expected nationwide broadcast. Presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, in a tweet Monday afternoon, said the presidential committee on coronavirus will brief the nation instead. “No presidential broadcast on COVID-19 updates today. Rather, the Presidential Task Force will during its usual media briefings bring the nation up to speed on the next steps”, he wrote. A source had told DAILY POST that isolated lockdown would be imposed in areas with high cases of coronavirus. With the latest announcement by the president, the PTF on COVID-19 is expected to inform Nigerians on the next step as the first phase of the lockdown ease elapses today. The broadcast cancellation came less than 24 hours after the confirmation by Aliyu Sani, the National Coordinator of the PTF. Aliyu spoke when he appeared on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. Commenting on how Nigerians have been flouting the guidelines, Aliyu said the president would decide whether the country should go ahead with the second phase of the lockdown ease. He said the PTF had reviewed the situation and was concerned in terms of the implementation. Aliyu disclosed that recommendations have been made to the President and everyone will have to wait for his decision on Monday.

Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has clarified that residents of Ogun State, who work in Lagos, will not be allowed to leave the state. DAILY POST reported yesterday that Gov Abiodun extended the COVID-19 lockdown in Ogun State by one week as it will now end on May 9. According to President Muhammadu Buhari’s lockdown relaxation directive, offices will resume work in Lagos and Abuja on Monday, May 4. Ogun State, as a result of its proximity to Lagos, plays host to many people who work in the large commercial hub. DAILY POST reports that many of those who live in Ogun communities like Mowe, Ibafo, Akute, Agbado, Ifo, Sango, Ota, Ogijo and others, work in Lagos. Following Abiodun’s lockdown extension yesterday, residents have continued to enquire if they would be allowed to go to work on May 4. Meanwhile, in a statement on Saturday, Abiodun re-echoed that there is a total ban on interstate travel outside Ogun State. According to him, anybody who works in Lagos or any other state, but lives in Ogun, will not be allowed to go to Lagos or any other state and return to the Gateway State. His words: “There is a total ban on interstate travel (outside Ogun). If you work in Lagos or any other state but you live in Ogun State, you are not allowed to go to Lagos or any other state and return to Ogun.” He informed that burials and naming ceremonies are allowed, but there must not be more than 15 persons present, including the officiating ministers.

Ohanaeze Ndigbo has denied appointing former Head of State, Yakubu Gowon, to lead the campaign for an Igbo president in 2023. This was contained in a statement signed by the group’s spokesman, Uche Achi-Okpaga, on Wednesday. Achi-Okpaga made it clear that Ohanaeze never contemplated involving either Gowon or any prominent politician. He said the “purported pact” with Gowon emanated from a group known as Ohanaeze Youth Council and “exists only in the imagination of the miscreants and enemies of the Igbo nation”. The statement read: “Ohanaeze Ndigbo reiterates that there is no organisation as Ohanaeze Youth Council recognized by Ndigbo and that the misguided so-called leader of the group, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, is a warped, egocentric and power-hungry mind who obviously is living in an incontrovertible state of mental delusion. “Ohanaeze Ndigbo regrets the unpatriotic acts of some Igbo politicians sponsoring these equally unpatriotic irredentists shamelessly flying the kite for them towards 2023.” Achi-Okpaga said added: “If it is the wish of God that Nigeria will have a president who is Igbo after 2023 elections, it will not be midwifed by an inconsequential group whose only mission and preoccupation is personal aggrandisement and not the collective interest and aspiration of Ndigbo.” Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council (OYC) had listed President Muhammadu Buhari, former President Olusegun Obasanjo, ex-Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, APC national leader, Bola Tinubu, Atiku, as those to be consulted in a quest for a 2023 Igbo presidency.

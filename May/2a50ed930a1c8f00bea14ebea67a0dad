The Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, on Friday appealed to the Kwara State Government to ensure immediate and full implementation of the N30,000 new minimum wage to its workers. NLC said the implementation of the minimum wage must be done in the face of economic hardship brought about by the COVID-19 lockdown in the state. DAILY POST recalls that Kwara currently has eleven COVID-19 cases. NLC made the appeal in a statement issued by Alhaji Issa Ore, its Kwara State Chapter Chairman, to commemorate the 2020 May Day celebration in Ilorin. “In the face of the hardship which Nigerians are currently going through as a result of the lockdown imposed to control the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) and its effects on the economy, we want to appeal to the state government to ensure the implementation of the N30,000 new minimum wage for workers,” Ore said. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria is 1932, according to the NCDC.

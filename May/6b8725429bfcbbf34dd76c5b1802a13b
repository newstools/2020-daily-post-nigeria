The National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu, has asked banks and offices to start adjusting their structure, as the federal government ponders lifting restrictions. Aliyu stated this during PTF’s daily briefing on Thursday. He reiterated the 8 am to 2 pm working hours and need to adhere to physical distancing. “For banks and other financial institutions as well as offices, now is the opportunity to start adjusting to the new life post-COVID, as we lift restrictions over the next few weeks. “We are therefore asking banks and offices to make allowance for physical distancing measures both inside and outside their premises, to ensure staff working in the offices are limited to not more than 50% capacity and to encourage online banking as well as working from home. “Offices are allowed to open for the same hours of 8 am to 2 pm including banks,” he said.

The Abia State Government has announced that Mr. Emmanuel Ononiwu who was declared wanted after he tested positive to COVID-19, has been found. The Honorable Commissioner for Information, in the State, Chief John Okiyi Kalu, disclosed this in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Thursday. Kalu said the patient who escaped from a temporary holding facility in Aba prior to movement to an isolation center has been taken back to the isolation facility at the Specialist Hospital and Diagnostic Centre, Amachara. The statement read in part: “To remove any possible doubt, we are taking the unprecedented step of publishing the pictures of Emmanuel Ononiwu taken from his place of isolation at Specialist Hospital and Diagnostic Centre, Amachara. “Ordinarily, we wouldn’t want to do this because of medical privacy issues but due to the public interest by his ill-advised personal decision to run from a holding location after testing positive to COVID-19, it is of public interest that we pictorially confirm he is in medical isolation and no longer constitutes a public health risk. “Mr. Ononiwu is being well taken care of and will not suffer any further consequences for his initial lack of good judgement which possibly happened because he was scared.” Governor Okezie Ikpeazu further directed the medical management team of the inter-ministerial committee on COVID-19 to give him the best possible cares The government further urged residents to stop the stigmatization of COVID-19 patients adding that the status is not a death sentence.

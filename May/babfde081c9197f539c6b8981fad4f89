Manchester United have asked their players outside the UK to return, although there are no plans to resume training yet, ESPN reports. Members of the squad who have been isolating with their families have been told to fly back this week. They have, however, not been ordered to report to their Carrington training base which has been closed since the Premier League was suspended on March 13. Bruno Fernandes, Fred, Victor Lindelof and Sergio Romero were some of the players given permission to leave England. The club do not expect that players arriving from overseas will have to enter quarantine beyond the measure already put in place by the UK government. The Premier League is planning to resume the current campaign in June at neutral venues behind closed doors.

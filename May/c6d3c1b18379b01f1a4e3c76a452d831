Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has  pointed way out of the impending recession in Nigeria. Ortom said agriculture was the way out of the impending recession in Nigeria which is projected to contract the economy of the country in 2020 by 3.4%, sequel to which crude oil benchmark had now been pegged at $20 per barrel with adverse effects on the Federal and State Governments. In a statement by his spokesperson, Tever Akase, Ortom said: “The way forward out of impending recession is to return to agriculture.” He urged the people to prepare for the recession by “cultivating every available arable land to produce food for sustenance and commercial purposes.” The Governor also reminded the people that COVID-19 is real and the best way to prevent the pandemic from spreading is adherence to measures such as social distancing, frequent hand washing with soap and avoiding public gatherings such as markets, burials, as well as religious and sporting events.

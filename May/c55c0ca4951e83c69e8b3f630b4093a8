The Niger State Police Command has warned operators of motorcycles to desist from operating until further notice as directed by the State Government or face the full wrath of the law. The state Commissioner of Police, CP Adamu Usmanin, who gave the warning in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, urged operators of tricycles in the state not to carry more than two persons. “This is to inform the General Public, most especially the motorcycle operators in the state that the enforcement has fully commenced and hereby warns motorcyclists to desist from operating while tricycles must not carry more than two persons. Anyone found violating this order shall be made to face the full wrath of the law.” It also stated that night curfew between 6:00pm to 7:00am without consideration to any essential service is being emplaced while inter-state travel ban is still in force. “Use of face mask in Public is compulsory, failure to comply, constitutes an offence contrary to section 17 (1) of the COVID-19 Order of the State,” the command said. “This is in furtherance to the directive of Niger State Government during COVID-19 Task Force meeting, as announced by the Executive Governor for another two weeks lockdown, that the operation of commercial motorcyclists (Okada) is banned in the State until further notice to curb the spread of the virus,” the command stated. “To ensure strict compliance, the state police boss directed all Heads of Departments, Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers to carry out the enforcement to the fullest and also enjoins Nigerlites/residents of the state to voluntarily abide by the order in the interest of public safety by seeing the measure as a means to curb the spread of Covid-19 in the state.” Okada ban: MC Oluomo warns commercial drivers against increase in transport fare as commuters groan COVID-19: Police warn transporters against violation of lockdown order in Niger COVID-19: Enugu Tricycle riders get caution against violation of govt's order

Governor of Zamfara State, Hon. Bello Mohammad Matawalle has vowed to punish anyone sabotaging efforts of the state government in controlling the deadly coronavirus. He noted that some people were not observing the government’s directive towards the prevention of COVID_19 instead they were sabotaging genuine efforts. This observation was made by the governor’s Special Adviser on media and public enlightenment, comrade Zailani Bappa in Gusau, during a chat with DAILY POST. “State government has been doing all it could to ensure that coronavirus is totally prevented in the state but some people are busy betraying the government’s efforts,” he said. “To prevent COVID_19 is the main reason why the governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has been putting up so many measures such as the closure of schools, markets and public gathering even government offices in the state” he added. According to him, the governor has no intention of witch-hunting anybody, not even the opposition, stressing that the measures were taken to prevent the dreaded COVID_19 in the state. The governor’s spokesman explained that some people have taken over the duties of medical experts, going around telling people how many people have died of coronavirus in the state without proper confirmation from the state Ministry of Health. Zailani further explained that only the state government has the power to announce the number of people that have been infected, died or kept in the three isolation centers in the state, saying that the government was not unaware of plans to discredit Matawalle’s administration. He, therefore, urged the people of the state to ignore rumours from public enemies pointing out that the state government is committed to saving lives in the state.

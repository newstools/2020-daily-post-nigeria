Deji Aboderin, a former Senior Special Assistant on Public Affairs to ex-Oyo State governor, Abiola Ajimobi has defected from the All Progressives Congress, APC, to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Aboderin listed favouritism, godfatherism within the APC in the state as part of reasons he defected to PDP. Addressing a press conference on Sunday, Aboderin, who was APC’s candidate for the Ibadan Southeast/Northeast Federal House of Representatives in Oyo during the 2019 general election, pointed that APC leadership had worked against him during the polls. Aboderin recalled that he was leading the election up until midnight when he was informed that his votes were been voided. He cited the ongoing good works of the state Governor, Seyi Makinde has endeared him to PDP. Aboderin noted that he finally decided to dump APC after due consultation with his constituency. According to Aboderin: “I have consulted my constituency, I have consulted my local government, I have also consulted my supporters. “As far as I am concerned, if this young Governor Seyi Makinde is doing well, he has done things within a year and there are ongoing projects still coming. “I believe in humanity, I believe in people, I believe people should be empowered, I believe in free education that the governor has done and still doing. ” I believe strongly in education which he is pumping money into at the moment and from that,after all the consultations with my constituency, I thereby defect to the PDP from today.”

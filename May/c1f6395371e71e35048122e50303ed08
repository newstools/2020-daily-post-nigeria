Chairman of the Nigeria Governorship Forum (NGF) and Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi, says Nigeria has to reduce the cost of governance if it plans to emerge stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. Fayemi stated this in Ado Ekiti on Saturday during an appearance on The Platform via video conference from his office. According to him, Nigeria must be ready to eliminate or minimize non-core expenses and to ensure that the wage bill at all levels of government is accompanied by productivity, accountability, and effectiveness of the workforce. He said, “With a reduction in revenue, we must reduce the cost of governance. “Apart from the passage of supplementary budgets by the Federal and state governments, we need to explore various recommendations on streamlining ministries, departments, and agencies of government to reduce wastage. “We must also be ready to eliminate or minimize non-core expenses and also to ensure that the wage bill at all levels of government is accompanied by accountability, productivity, and effectiveness of our workforce.” Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria now stands at 2170, according to NCDC.

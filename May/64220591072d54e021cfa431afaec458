Former Chelsea boss, Antonio Conte, has claimed his 4-0 win over Manchester United during his early days at Stamford Bridge, was his turning point at the club. Conte spent only two years with the Blues, winning the Premier League title in his first season and the FA Cup in his final game in 2018. However, the Italian didn’t have the finest of starts, as he lost two of his first six games in charge. Conte switched to a back three following a demoralising 3-0 defeat to Arsenal in September and it provided instant results. But the third match was their biggest test yet, when Mourinho returned to the club for the first time since his sacking a year earlier. Chelsea went ahead to hammer United 4-0 in emphatic style. “I live my job in an intense way!” Conte told Sky Sports, after he was asked about his wild goal celebrations. “Sometimes I show my passion and I want to share my happiness with the fans. I had an amazing relationship with Chelsea fans. “That game was important for us because when you win 4-0 against a top team it’s a boost because we understood very well that we could fight to win the league. “This game gave us confidence and belief in ourselves and we created a fantastic relationship with our fans.” EPL: Mourinho reveals what he told Tottenham players at halftime that led to 3-2 win over West Ham EPL: What Lampard said after Chelsea's 2-0 win over Mourinho's Tottenham Chelsea: Conte agrees with Lampard on Kante’s position

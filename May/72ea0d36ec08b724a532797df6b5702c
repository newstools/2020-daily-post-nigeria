Eminent political scholar Dr. Uche Igwe, has condoled with Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, over the death of his Special Assistant on Electronic Media, Simeon Nwakaudu. The university lecturer described the late aide as “a dedicated professional and a loyal workaholic who served his boss with utmost diligence and dedication.” He prayed that God will give the governor, the state government and family of the deceased the fortitude to bear the loss. However, Igwe advised Wike to ensure that everyone who was at the recent People’s Democratic Party (PDP) event proceed on self-isolation. He said would ensure that all residents in the state remain safe from the rampaging coronavirus. The pundit warned that all hands must be on deck to prevent a community infection in Rivers. Igwe further called on the Rivers State Task Force on COVID-19 to be transparent, inclusive and shun all forms of partisanship going forward. The late media aide is survived by a wife and four children.

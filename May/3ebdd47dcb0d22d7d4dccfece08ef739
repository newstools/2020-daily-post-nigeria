Two persons were confirmed dead and 13 others injured in an accident involving a lorry and a commercial bus along Ihiala axis of the Onitsha-Owerri Expressway in Anambra on Friday. Mr Andrew Kumapayi, State Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Anambra, who confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said the accident which occurred at about 7.10 a.m. could be attributed to speeding and loss of control. Kumapayi said the crash involved a tipper without registration number and a commercial bus with registration number NEN-59XQ. “An eyewitness told us that the tipper driver was negotiating into his house when the bus suddenly rammed into it. The crash occurred during a heavy downpour. “A total of 15 persons, 10 adult males and five adult females were involved in the crash. “Twelve persons sustained serious injuries and were taken to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and God’s Favour Hospital Okohia, both in Ihiala town. “As at the time of filling this report, two victims, the driver whose leg was amputated in the crash and another victim were confirmed dead by doctors at the hospital,” he said. He, however, stated that rescue operation was jointly carried out by operatives of the Nigeria Police, the Department of State Services, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps and FRSC. Kumapayi advised motorists to drive within the stipulated speed limit and shun dangerous driving that could lead to avoidable road mishap.

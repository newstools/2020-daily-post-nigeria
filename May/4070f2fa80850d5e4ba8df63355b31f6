A “healing church” has been fined for promoting an industrial bleach solution as a miracle cure for COVID-19. The Australian drugs regulator fined MMS Australia, an international church group that wrote to U.S. President, Donald Trump promoting bleach as COVID-19 cure. They are to pay 151,200 dollars. According to Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), the healing church was fined for selling products that pose serious health risks. The church group had claimed that chlorine dioxide, an industrial bleach it sells as MMS, was a “miracle cure” for COVID-19, as well as autism, acne, cancer, diabetes and other ailments. The regulator said it had issued 12 infringement notices “for the alleged unlawful advertising’’ of the Miracle Mineral Supplement or Solution (MMS) on the church’s website, Dpa reports. The solution has since been removed from the Australian website. TGA in the statement on Wednesday expressed worries over the harmful effects that can be caused by the ingestion of MMS. It warned consumers about untrue claims online about the cure for Coronavirus and other diseases. “There is no clinical, scientifically-accepted evidence showing that MMS can cure or alleviate any disease. “The use of MMS can result in nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and severe dehydration, which in some cases can result in hospitalization,’’ TGA warned.

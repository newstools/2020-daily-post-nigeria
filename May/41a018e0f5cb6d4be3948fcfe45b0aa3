Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, was on Tuesday, May 12, 2020, the guest Biology teacher to senior secondary students in the state. The state had organized “radio classroom” program aimed at bridging the teaching and learning gap due to COVID-19 lockdown. The Governor, who was formerly the Head of Biochemistry Department at the Enugu State University of Science and Technology centered his 45 minutes presentation on respiration and later answered questions from students as well as gave assignments for the next lesson. He was accompanied by the State Commissioners for Education and Information, Dr KCK Nwangwa and Chief John Okiyi Kalu.  Ikpeazu also announced that the ongoing closure of schools in the state will subsist until it is safe to re-open state schools. He, therefore, urged parents to use the opportunity presented by the radio classroom program to be part of the education of their children as well as bond with them by preparing and supervising them during the program which starts from 8am every weekday. He also commended the teachers, state ministry of education, and management and staff of Broadcasting Corporation of Abia State (BCA) for packaging the highly popular program which has received commendation from parents within and outside the state.

A former Chelsea pacey winger, Jesper Gronkjaer, has predicted that Hakim Ziyech, will succeed at Stamford Bridge after his £37 million move from Ajax. DAILY POST had reported that Chelsea sealed a deal for Ziyech in late February. The Moroccan international will link up with Frank Lampard’s side at the end of this season. But Gronkjaer believes that Ziyech will be a regular starter in the Blues’ starting XI, adding that the 27-year-old was a good signing for the west London club. “Ziyech is the player who has caught my eye over the past two seasons even though he didn’t come through Ajax’s academy. “Chelsea needs a player like him at Stamford Bridge. “Ziyech is a fantastic player and I think he will be in Chelsea’s starting XI. “It was a good signing for Chelsea, and he will start many games for the club,” Gronkjaer told Goal.

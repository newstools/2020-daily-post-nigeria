The Police Command in Enugu State arrested sixteen suspects for various criminal offences within its operations in April. ASP Daniel Ndukwe, the Command’s Public Relations Officer, made this known in a statement in Enugu on Saturday. Ndukwe said the suspects were arrested for offences that included armed robbery, conspiracy, murder, fraud, cultism, and unlawful possession of firearms. He said that the command recovered 16 live ammunition, six locally-made firearms with four live cartridges, and one axe from the suspects. Also recovered were two cutlasses. According to him, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr. Ahmad Abdurrahman, had commended efforts of the resilient officers, security stakeholders, and citizens of the state for the collaboration and supports that made the breakthroughs possible. The statement read in part: “The commissioner reiterated the command’s resolve to rid the state of all forms of crimes and criminality, particularly in these trying times of the COVID-19 crisis. “To this end, the commissioner has charged all Area Commanders, DPOs, and Heads of Tactical/Operational Departments and Formations of the command not to relent in combating crimes and criminality in the state. “Residents have been enjoined to remain law-abiding and report suspected criminals and acts of criminality to the nearest police station or by calling the command’s emergency hotlines on 08032003702, 08075390883, 08086671202 or 08098880172.”

Secretary to the government of the federation, Boss Mustapha, on Wednesday said the Federal Ministry of Education will soon issue guidelines for the reopening of schools in the country. Boss Mustapha made this known during Wednesday’s daily briefing by the COVID-19 task force. Recall that the Lagos State government had explained that it does not have the authority to unilaterally order the reopening of schools in the State. The state Commissioner for Education, Folashade Adefisayo during an online programme, ‘Covinspiration show,’ had said the State was meeting with officials of the Federal Ministry of Education to draw up guidelines ahead of reopening of schools. However, wishing all Nigerian children a happy children day celebration, Mustapha urged all state proprietors and stakeholders to take steps that will facilitate an early and safe reopening “ I wish to inform Nigerians that the Federal Ministry of Education will roll out measures for the self-reopening of schools. “The Presidential Task Force wishes to use the occasion of this celebration to congratulate our children and assure them, their parents and all stakeholders alike that all hands are on deck to reopen schools at a safe time,” he added

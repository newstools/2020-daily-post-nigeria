Mr. Akintayo Adaralegbe, MD/CEO of T Pumpy Concept Limited, developers of over 22 T Pumpy Estates units, Abuja, has explained the reason behind the slash in price of its land from N3.5m to N1.75m, offering 50 per cent discount. According to Mr. Adaralegbe, the promo was done to encourage Nigerians to own their houses due to the effect of Coronavirus pandemic on the livelihoods of many Nigerians and also to complement government’s national housing plan. He noted that although T Pumpy has 22 housing estates and properties scattered across Kyami, Kasana, Kuje, Lugbe, Gwagwalada and other places in the nation’s capital, however, the ongoing promo is only exclusive to their property along the Airport Road. Speaking on the development, the CEO on Friday said the offer would end on June 30. In his words, “I have said this several times that one of my greatest passions is to see that every Nigerian own a house of his or her own. It is not all about business but a sincerity purpose to roofs over the heads of many Nigerians as much as I can assist. He said, “Imagine owning a standard 600sqm plot of a duplex, a penthouse or a bungalow for as low N1.75m. We are doing this because of the economic effects of the coronavirus on the people. “Of course you known it is every man’s dream to own a house and that is why T Pumpy Concept Limited wants to make sure to actualize that dream for them. “The market worth of the land is N3.5m but we are giving it out at this price just to encourage Nigerians at this critical time. Our lands are verifiable and authentic; they are government-approved. This promo will end on June 30. “We sell and develop all types of estate lands for residential, educational, commercial and recreational purposes.

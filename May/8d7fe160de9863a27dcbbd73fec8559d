Pastor Ize-Iyamu, a former Secretary to Edo State Government (SSG) has debunked reports that he has received an endorsement from the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, national leader, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu and President Muhammadu Buhari, to contest the election. Ize-Iyamu, who spoke to newsmen after he picked his nomination form at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja, said he was endorsed by seven other intending aspirants who stepped down for him. Recall that Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, on Tuesday emerged as the All Progressives Congress (APC) consensus candidate for the state governorship election. Ize-Iyamu emerged as consensus candidate on Tuesday night in Abuja. He was presented by the chairman of the screening committee, Senator Francis Alimikhena, the representative of Edo North Senatorial District. Ize-Iyamu further stated that Governor Obaseki’s insistence on direct primaries was because he wants to manipulate the primaries. According to him, “direct mode of primaries is the best method under the current deadly health coronavirus pandemic,” The Sun quoted him as saying. Meanwhile, several attempts to get a reaction from the Governor through Crusoe Osagie, Special Adviser to the State Governor on Media and Communication, proved abortive as he did not take calls and also did not respond to text messages. Governor Godwin Obaseki had earlier on Wednesday boasted that he will emerge governor of Edo State, ahead of the governorship election in the State. Obasek, who spoke as a guest on a channels TV’s Sunrise Daily on Wednesday, expressed confidence that he will return as the governor of the sytate. He maintained that no one can stop him because only God gives power.

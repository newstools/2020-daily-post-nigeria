The Kano State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has said the use of face masks is now compulsory, for anyone to worship in any church in the state. This directive was contained in a statement on Friday, signed by the chairman of the association, Rev. Samuel Adeyemo. Adeyemo said the decision follows the approval by the state government, for churches to reopen from Sunday, May 24. Churches have been told to begin services from 6 am, but must complete the service by 1 pm. This will allow for worshippers to arrive at their homes before 2 pm when the open day would terminate. The statement read: “Wearing of face mask is compulsory before anyone is allowed into the church for worship. “Bucket/drum of water and soap for hand washing before entering into the church for worship must be made available.” It added. “Availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizers for worshippers to use before, during and/or after worship,” the statement said. “Beloved servants of God, we sincerely request that all our pastors and congregants observe these important regulations as both CAN’s monitoring and enforcement team shall be visiting every church alongside the state monitoring and enforcement team. “We do believe we shall cooperate with the CAN leadership to sustain the honour God has given to his church in the land/state.” COVID-19: Govt grants CAN request, reveals time Churches, Mosques can hold services COVID-19: Governor Ayade orders resumption of Sunday services in Cross River Easter Sunday: We'll continue to enforce lockdown order - Delta Police declares

EFL Chairman, Rick Parry, has warned that there would be a “breach” of agreements if clubs from the Championship are denied promotion to the Premier League. English football authorities are still in talks over how to resume the season amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Parry, however, insisted that “the lawyers are going to get wealthy” if three teams are not promoted from the Championship. When asked what would happen if the Premier League’s position changed, Parry said: “The lawyers are going to get wealthy if that happens. There would be a degree of outrage from some clubs in our Championship, and it would be a breach of the tripartite agreement. “The safe answer is that it would get very messy. Our expectation is there would be three clubs promoted from the Championship.” The Premier League is considering playing out the remaining games at a neutral venue, in a bid to complete the season.

Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has revealed that he is trying to convince the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, to allow the resumption of flights from Lagos to Abuja. Sanwo-Olu stated this while speaking as a panelist at a webinar hosted by FSDH Merchant Bank on Friday. According to the Governor, the impact of the closure of the airports on the state’s economy, has been significant. The Federal Government shut all international airports in the country on March 23, before it later extended the closure to all airports in the country. “The aviation industry has been badly hit and just this (Friday) morning, I spoke with a major player in that industry and we are trying to get the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 to see whether we are going to resume Lagos–Abuja flights before we get to other sectors. There has to be some gradual process in lifting the lockdown. “We will continue to have engagements with all of the players down the value chain. At the right time when we see that the t’s have been crossed and the i’s have been dotted, we will do that and you can hold us to that,” Sanwo-Olu said.

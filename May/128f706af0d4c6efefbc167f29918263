The National Publicity Secretary of the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, Mr. Kunle Edun, on Wednesday, said the cases of persons declared positive of COVID-19 by the Delta State Government was too “hazy”. Edun, who was reacting to the alleged breaches of the rights of some Nigerians during the pandemic, stressed that, “The cloud surrounding the veracity of the Omamuzo’s case is still hazy.” In a statement sent to DAILY POST in Warri, Edun said, “There have been complaints of a COVID-19 patient running away and being caught in Enugu State. “There are allegations of lack of care for the patients in the isolation centre or some being turned back by hospitals. “I think the State Government should do more. There is no testing centre in the entire Delta State. That is not good for the image of the state. Are the isolation centres comfortable to stay? “The level of COVID-19 safety compliance is very low. I urge the state government to do more. COVID-19 is not a death sentence.” Edun earlier noted that there were cases of abuse of the rights of Nigerian by security agents during the dreaded coronavirus pandemic. “Proceedings at some of the Mobile Courts are less than what proper proceedings should be with the defendants not having the opportunity of legal advice and representation. According to Edun, “As long as we are not in a jungle and there are courts, lawyers must be considered as performing essential services and exempted in the restrictions order.” COVID-19: Unauthorized hospitals handling Coronavirus cases - Nigerian government alleges Nigerian newspapers: 10 things you need to know this Sunday morning COVID-19: Index case discharged in Osun, as more suspects test negative

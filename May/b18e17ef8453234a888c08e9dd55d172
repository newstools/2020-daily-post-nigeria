The All Progressives Congress, APC, has accused Atiku Abubakar, former Vice President of serving under a “shortsighted” administration for eight years. APC’s National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu said Atiku in his suggestion to President Muhammadu Buhari admitted he served as Vice President under a shortsighted administration. Issa-Onilu expressed surprise that it took Atiku, a former Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, 13 years to realize the kind of Government he served under. Atiku served as Vice President to President Olusegun Obasanjo from 1999 to 2007. However, Issa-Onilu said Obasanjo’s administration failed to diversify Nigeria’s economy while in power. Issa-Onilu said Atiku headed the National Council on Privatisation but failed to salvage Nigeria’s economy. The APC spokesperson lamented that Nigeria’s economy got worse during Obasanjo’s tenure when the international oil price was stable. “While we appreciate that Atiku Abubakar is keying into this administration’s policy direction regarding diversification, we are only worried that it took him 13 years after leaving office to realise that the Government under which he served as the Vice President was shortsighted for its failure to faithfully diversify the Nigerian economy. “Not to be confused, Atiku Abubakar had eight years as a powerful Vice President and Chairman of the National Council on Privatisation with a vantage opportunity to lead the country away from its dependence on oil. How Nigeria got worse even when international oil prices were stable and high are matters Atiku Abubakar may still need to address in future,” APC said.

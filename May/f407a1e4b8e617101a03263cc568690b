Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Edo State, Tony Aziegbemi, has insisted that there will be no automatic ticket for Governor Godwin Obaseki if he finally joins the party ahead of forthcoming governorship election. Appearing on Channels Television on Thursday, Aziegbemi, however, said that the party’s door was open for the embattled incumbent governor to join. According to him, “Our doors are opened. Governor Obaseki is our governor in the State. If he wants to join the PDP, he is free to do so. “But will he get an automatic ticket? The answer is an emphatic no. He has to go through the processes.” He insisted that even if National Working Committee, NWC, of the PDP considers given Obaseki a waiver, he “will still get to get to the delegates to explain to them why he should be given the ticket and all that. So it’s a process and that process is open to all Nigerians,” he said. “So our doors are not closed at all. We feel that Governor Obaseki is being humiliated, maltreated and being given the wrong stick by his party.” Asked about the party’s earlier claim that the Governor has not done enough for the State since elected 4 years ago, he said, “Will we give him automatic ticket? I say no. Can he join the party and I said yes. Can he be given a waiver? I said yes. Can he contest in the primary? I said yes of course. That’s what I’m saying.” Recall that pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, a former Secretary to Edo State Government (SSG) emerged the Adams Oshiomhole faction of the APC consensus candidate for the state governorship election on Wednesday.

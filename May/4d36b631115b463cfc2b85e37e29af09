The Police Command in Rivers State has assured free movement of agricultural produce into and outside the state. The development coincides with the Northern community’s suit against Governor Nyesom Wike over the arrest of livestock, farm products and trailer drivers. Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, on Thursday, gave the assurance of easy transportation in Port Harcourt at the inauguration of a Joint Technical Task Team on Emergency Response to COVID-19. There are growing concerns over steady increase in prices and shortages of foodstuffs in Rivers. “The team will immediately hit the ground running to deliver on its mandates as well as stick strictly to their terms of reference,” NAN quoted him as saying. The CP urged members of the team to discharge their duties with professionalism and justify the confidence reposed on them by the Federal Government. On the committee are Mukan himself, the NSCDC Commandant, Murktar Lawal and representative of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria, Mr. O. Igwe. Others are: Nigeria Union of Journalists chairman, Stanley Job and representative of Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Mike Brooks.

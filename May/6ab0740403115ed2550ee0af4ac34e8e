The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo has said hunger caused the defection of its members to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). PDP Acting Chairman, Martin Ejiogu, stated this at a media briefing on Thursday. Former chairman, Charles Ezekwem, ex-Publicity Secretary, Damion’s Opara, ex-Youth leader, Williams Ahanonu, among others, had defected to the APC. He said the defectors worked against the PDP during the 2019 general elections. Ejiogu declared that they were not relevant to PDP. “We are not bothered by their exit because none of the defectors delivered their polling unit at the 2019 general elections. They were all liabilities to the party and now that they have left, we will be stronger to fight a common goal,” he said. The official advised the APC to be wary of “gold-diggers”. Ejiogu added that their decision was selfish as they claimed that the zoning arrangement of the party did not favour them. He said they had “in principle left the party a long time ago because what played out earlier today was a mere drama, a dummy from a script that had been written months before now”.

The Ondo State Government has given a month ultimatum for concern residents of the state to evacuate the corpses of their loved ones from morgues operated by the government for decent burial or risk being given mass burial. The state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro, who disclosed this on Saturday, stated that the move became imperative due to the congestion of morgues across government hospitals in the state. While stressing that the ultimatum takes effective from May 11, 2020, Dr. Adegbenro said that if urgent measures are not taken towards decongesting the mortuaries it will constitute public health hazard to residents of the State. The Health Commissioner, who said that the government was not insensitive to the culture, traditions, and feelings of the people, said the ultimatum was given in the overall best interest of the state. Dr. Adegbenro said at the expiration of the one month, all unclaimed and unburied corpses will be given mass burial. The commissioner added that there is no prohibition of the burial of loved ones by families in the state but emphasized that the COVID-19 precautionary measures must be strictly adhered to during the process. Adegbenro stated that “burial rites and services must be held at the graveside with not more than 20 people in attendance, social distancing rule must be obeyed to the latter. “No burial services in Churches or Mosques or partying after burial until the coast is clear and nose masks must be worn by all attendees as well as soap and water provided for hand-washing and hand Sanitizer provided should be made available.” Unpaid Salaries: Ondo doctors to embark on strike amid COVID-19 pandemic Panic in Ondo Communities over death of suspected COVID-19 patient in general hospital Hundreds of abandoned corpses litter UCTH morgue in Cross River

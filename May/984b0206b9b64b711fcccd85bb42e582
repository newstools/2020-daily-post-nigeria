The Ondo State Government has discharged three more coronavirus patients, making a total of six discharged cases in the state. Mr. Donald Ojogo, the state’s Commissioner for Information and Orientation, made this known in a statement on Wednesday in Akure, stating that the three patients are safe to join their families. He said, “Those discharged today include the first police officer who earlier tested positive in Lagos but came to Akure out of panic. “The woman from Owo and the lady who had arrived Akure from Abuja was prevented from gaining access to her apartment by the vigilant landlord. “In effect, seven of the 13 confirmed cases in Ondo State are still on admission at the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH) under strict protocols.”

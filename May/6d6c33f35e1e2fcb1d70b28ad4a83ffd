Borussia Dortmund captain, Marco Reus, has disclosed that players in the German top-flight league are not lab rats that are tested as the Bundesliga prepares for its grand return on Saturday (today). Reus, who will hope to lead Dortmund to victory when they host Schalke on Saturday afternoon, also said that he feels good to be heading back onto the field. He, however, said that caution must still be exercised in the circumstances, with more than 175,000 people in Germany having tested positive for the virus. DAILY POST recalls that the Bundesliga had been suspended for the last two months due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world.  “Players are no lab rats that are tested,” Reus told El Pais. “It was the only possibility. There is no reason to complain. “The coronavirus has turned lives upside down. The whole world has been and will continue to be challenged. “We must not become careless now. We have to listen to the instructions of the politicians and the virologists responsibly.” EPL: Marco Reus advises Sancho against leaving Dortmund 10 players test positive to COVID-19 in Bundesliga 1, 2 Bundesliga: Haaland sets new record after scoring two goals in Dortmund’s win over Berlin

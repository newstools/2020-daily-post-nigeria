According to Italian newspaper, Calcio Mercato, the Nezarrurri are unwilling to match Chelsea’s €12 million price tag for the former Nigerian international. The Italian Serie A giants will require the Blues to drop their evaluation of the 29-year-old if he is to complete a permanent switch to Inter this summer. Inter Milan manager, Antonio Conte, remains eager to sign Moses on a permanent deal at the end of his loan deal at San Siro. Recall that Moses joined Inter from Chelsea on loan last January transfer window. He had made seven appearances for Inter across all competitions so far this season before the Serie A was suspended due to the spread of COVID-19 across the world.

Pope Francis, speaking from the papal library at the Vatican on Sunday, said any successful vaccine developed should be made available around the world to the benefit all of humanity. He called for international scientific cooperation to be transparent and ensure every country benefits from COVID-19 vaccine “It is important to unite scientific capabilities, in a transparent and impartial way to find vaccines and treatments. ”World leaders should guarantee universal access to essential technologies that allow each infected person, in every part of the world, to receive the necessary medical treatment,” he said.

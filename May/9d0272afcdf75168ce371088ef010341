Chelsea are confident of signing Manchester United starlet, Angel Gomes, the UK Mirror reports. Gomes’ agent, Pini Zahavi, is believed to have held talks with Blues transfer chief, Marina Granovskaia. The 19-year-old’s current deal with United runs out next month and he has turned down a £30,000-a-week offer. United remain hopeful of tying the midfielder down to a new contract, but Gomes is demanding regular first-team football, after just six first-team appearances for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this season. Lampard remains a massive advocate of promoting youth at Stamford Bridge, with the likes of Mason Mount, Fikayo Tomori and Reece James having all benefited from his philosophy. Gomes captained England U-19s to World Cup success in 2018 and only last month suggested he wanted to stay at United and win trophies.

Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has been listed in the prestigious Sunday Times Young Sports Rich List for 2020. Only individuals and families residing in the UK are eligible to be included in the Young Sport Rich List aged 30 and under. The former Super Eagles star comes in at number 15 and he’s the only Nigerian-born sportsman in the top 18, as boxer Anthony Joshua, who ranked second, was born in Watford, England. Ighalo is worth £18million, same with Juventus midfielder Aaron Ramsey, former Arsenal striker Danny Welbeck and West Ham’s Jack Wilshere. A large chunk of Ighalo’s wealth comes from his salary at Shanghai Shenhua, where he was earning around £300,000 per week before he arrived at Old Trafford in January. Liverpool winger, Mohamed Salah, is the highest-ranked African with a worth of £19million. The top five richest are: Gareth Bale (£114m), Anthony Joshua (£107m), Paul Pogba (£50m), Kevin de Bruyne (£34m) and David de Gea (£34m).

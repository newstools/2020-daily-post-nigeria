The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Kaduna Zonal Office, has arrested one Beegu Tyopav for fraudulently obtaining the sum of N90,000 from one Daniel Osayande, in Kaduna. The commission on Thursday arraigned the suspect before Justice Mohammed Tukur of the Kaduna State High Court on a one-count charge bordering on internet-related fraud. Tukur sentenced the suspect to two years term in a correctional facility or an option of N150,000 fine after he pleaded guilty to internet fraud. Earlier, counsel to EFCC, E. K. Garba, while presenting the case, told the court that on March 3, Tyopav fraudulently induced one Daniel Osayande, a retiree, to disclose his Automated Teller Machine (ATM) PIN, by impersonating one Godwin Philemon, working with First Bank Plc. He further explained that when Osayande disclosed the PIN, the accused fraudulently transferred N90,000 from Osayandeâ€™s account to his account. The counsel stated that the offense was contrary to and punishable under Section 142(1) of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law, 2017. In view of his plea, the prosecution counsel had prayed the court to sentence the convict accordingly, NAN reports.

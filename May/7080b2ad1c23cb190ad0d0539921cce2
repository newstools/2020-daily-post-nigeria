The Federal Government on Monday said hospitals were rejecting sick patients in Kano State. The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 announced this in an update on the state’s battle against coronavirus. Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and PTF Chairman spoke at the daily briefing in Abuja. He disclosed that the team received reports that medical facilities and doctors were turning back sick patients over the fear that their illnesses were COVID-19-related. Mustapha begged hospitals not to neglect the treatment of other ailments because such actions had resulted in avoidable deaths. He noted that teams dispatched from Abuja had continued to work with the state structure and were doing well. “We have achieved a lot in the area of manpower support, equipment deployment and usage, increased testing capacity and treatment centres. “Efforts are also ongoing to upscale the training of medical personnel in Kano and neighbouring states on the management of infectious diseases and to provide them with Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) for protection. “Private hospitals have also been advised to seek accreditation before taking up the management of infectious diseases,” Mustapha said. The SGF disclosed that federal and Kano governments were strengthening existing structures, especially for sustainability.

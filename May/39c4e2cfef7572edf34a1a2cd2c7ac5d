TB Joshua, the Senior Pastor of the Synagogue Church of all Nations (SCOAN), contributed to Ghana’s 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup victory in Egypt by offering the team prayers before each match and arranging the order of the team’s penalty takers in the final against Brazil. This was disclosed by a former Ghana U-20 midfielder, Gladson Awako. Ghana became the first nation in Africa to win the FIFA U-20 World Cup when they defeated Brazil 4-3 on penalties after the game ended 1-1 in 120 minutes. The West African country had a player sent off in the 37th minute when Daniel Addo was given a red card during the encounter. Eleven years after that famous victory, Awako, who presently plays for Ghana Premier League club, Great Olympics, has now revealed that TB Joshua predicted Ghana would have a player sent off during the match. “During the 2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup in Egypt, we normally gathered around the centre to pray,” The 31-year-old said in an Instagram live chat with YAC Media. “The coach usually made us speak to a man on the phone. “He’ll put the phone on loudspeaker, so we could all hear and then pray and do what he says. “Most of the things he said came to pass, especially the final. “He predicted that we would get an early red card and also told us how we would arrange the penalty takers. “All that came to pass. Honestly, I did not know who it was until we won the cup, and they told us the man was TB Joshua.”

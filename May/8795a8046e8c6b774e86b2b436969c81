Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, on Saturday said the government must take responsibility for the consequences of relaxing the COVID-19 lockdown. President Muhammadu Buhari had initially imposed a lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States in a bid to tackle the spread of COVID-19. But, on Monday the President extended the lock by another one week due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. In a nationwide address, Buhari had announced a gradual relaxation of the lockdown, starting from May 4. However, AYCF President-General, Yerima Shettima said the government must be ready to take responsibility for its actions, be it good or bad. In a chat with DAILY POST, Shettima insisted that the government can not continue to keep people at home without providing food. Shettima lamented that the federal government should always make provisions for emergency disaster management. According to Shettima: “The government has not done enough, you can’t keep people without providing an alternative for them. “You can’t assume to run a house or family without a plan B and if this is how the government of Nigeria is being run then something is wrong from the inception. “Government should have assumed that there are natural disasters that can happen at any time, why was there no provision for situations like what we are currently facing? “There was no plan so definitely the government must take responsibility for whatever happens either good or bad. “They should pass laws that would enable people maintain the social distancing rules as they go about looking for their daily bread but you can’t keep people at home without providing food for them. “You can’t keep people only when you talk about palliatives in rhetorics. “So the government must take responsibility for its actions irrespective of whatever the consequences, but I hope it is for good and Nigerians should be very careful as they go about looking for their daily bread.”

The Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, has expressed optimism that Buhari’s new Chief of Staff, Professor Ibrahim Gambari (CFR) would bring his international experience to bear on governance to the advantage of Nigerians. Reacting to the appointment of the Kwara born academician and diplomat in a statement on Thursday in Abuja, he said, Gambari’s ”intellectual achievements and decades of international experience will have positive impact on the progressive objectives of the Buhari administration.” The DSP also noted that the scholar-diplomat was stepping in at a very critical time for the All Progressives Congress(APC)-led administration and the nation. “I join millions of other Nigerians in congratulating Professor Ibrahim Gambari (CFR), on this new national assignment as Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari. “There is no doubt that his towering intellectual achievements and pragmatic international experience are critical towards a successful discharge of the onerous responsibilities of the office, especially at this critical point in the life of the administration. “I pray that God will further guide, protect and inspire you and our dear president towards actualizing the progressive ideals that we have set out to achieve, for the benefit of millions of Nigerians and the coming generations,” Senator Omo-Agege stated.

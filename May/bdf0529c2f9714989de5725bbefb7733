Shanghai Shenhua is ready to allow Odion Ighalo remain at Manchester United until January 2021, Sky Sports reports. Both clubs are still negotiating on extending Ighaloâ€™s loan deal which runs out at the end of May. The 30-year-old may, however, not be able to return to China in time for the new season, because of border restrictions. Shanghai Shenhua initially said they would only agree to extend his loan if an obligation to buy was inserted into the deal. It is now believed the Chinese Super League side will now allow him to continue playing for United. However, as a condition of him being allowed to extend his stay at Old Trafford, Ighalo is expected to sign a new deal with them.

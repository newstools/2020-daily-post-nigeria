Manchester United midfielder, Fred, has urged teammate, Paul Pogba, to stay at Old Trafford beyond this summer amid interests linking the France World Cup winner with a move away from the club. Pogba has drawn the interest of Juventus and Real Madrid in the past. The 27-year-old’s current deal at Man United will expire at the end of next season. But Fred ‘really hopes’ Pogba stays at United, adding that the former Juventus star will strengthen Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side next season. “Pogba is a great player,” the Brazilian told Esporte Interativo. “The people who are here daily with him know that. “Everyone who watched the World Cup and watched his football knows that he is a great player. “And for sure, we want him to stay because he’ll add us a lot. “He is a guy who has immense quality, and he is a strong player for the Premier League. “He knows how to play the Premier League. So I am sure I want him to stay because I am sure he will help us a lot. “So, I hope that he stays, and if he stays, I am sure he will be a powerful reinforcement for us next season.” EPL: Bruno Fernandes rates Man Utd midfielder, Pogba EPL: Claudio Marchisio tells Man Utd midfielder to leave club EPL: Man Utd midfielder advised to join club where he feels important

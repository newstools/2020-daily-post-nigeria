The index COVID-19 case in Adamawa State and four subsequent cases have been discharged from the isolation and treatment centre at the state capital, Yola. The quintet were discharged Monday afternoon after they tested negative for the second time to COVID-19. The number of those discharged came as a surprise because for many days leading up to Monday morning, speculations had been that two cases were awaiting the result of their respective second test for possible discharge. But Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, who authorised the discharge of the five on Monday, said they had been duly certified by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). He congratulated the five and appealed that they be accepted back in society without stigmatisation. With the five certified free of COVID-19, Adamawa State now has 12 active cases, as the number had been 17 up to Sunday night when the last update was released by NCDC without any fresh case in Adamawa.

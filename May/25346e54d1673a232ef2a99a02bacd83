Renewed cult clashes in Calabar, Cross River State have allegedly claimed no fewer than six lives. The two days killing spree which started on Saturday during the burial of a suspected Bakassi Strike Force cult member extended to Sunday night. A witness who declined given his identity said, “The face-off started on Saturday after the burial of Ene Akabom, a suspected ex-member of the dreaded Bakassi Strike Force who was also a known cultist in the Idang-Ibesikpo-Ambo axis of Calabar South LGA. “It was at the funeral that the rival gangs had altercations which led to the resurgence of the clash. After the burial, the face-off became intense so that a member of one group was shot and killed near Duncan Street. “As we speak, six members of the rival groups have been killed as of Sunday night at different locations in Calabar. A barber was shot right inside his shop at Mbukpa Road when he was attending to customers on Sunday by 7pm. “This led to a stampede in the nearby popular Mbukpa market in Calabar South local government area. Another was allegedly cut into pieces and carried in a sack bag to the victim’s compound. “The members of the two leading cult fraternities, Klanz and Axe, reportedly participated in the funeral where sporadic gunshots were heard” he explained. When newsmen contacted the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Irene Ugbo, she said the police had been informed of the clash and had deployed men all over the city.

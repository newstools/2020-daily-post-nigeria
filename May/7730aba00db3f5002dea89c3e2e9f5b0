The Crisis in the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Cross River State is getting dirtier as days pass by. Already, there are parallel ward executive councils in all the eighteen local government areas of the state. A parallel executive of ward three led by the Chairman, Peter Ika and fifteen others have suspended the State Party Chairman Ntufam Edim Inok Edim. Another Parallel executive of ward three led by Edikan Eno-Obong Tom and others suspended a member of the State House of Assembly, Rt Hon Efa Nyong Esau and sixteen others. The suspended members were members of ward three and the Party Chairman was suspended for insubordination and insult on the National Working Committee members. Hon Eta Nyong Esau was accused of instigating those who suspended the Party Chairman of the Party alleging that his house was used for the illegal meeting. “That Hon Efa Nyong Esau and his cohorts are the ones behind all the fake allegations and the labels with impunity against the State Party Chairman due to jealousy, bad faith and hatred for Ntufam Edim Inok Edim” When contacted on Wednesday, Hon Efa Nyong Esau said that those who suspended him are not recognized members of the exco in the ward but those recruited by the embattled Chairman. “Those boys were assembled by the Chairman of the Party who was suspended by legally recognized exco members of the ward. The Chairman gave them two thousand naira each after the hatchet work. I have already consulted my lawyers” he stated.

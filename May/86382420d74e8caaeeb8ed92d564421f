The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, Ekiti state Command, said it intercepted a bus that sneaked into the state carrying travelers who say they are coming from Ilorin to sell onions. The State Commandant of NSCDC, Mr. Solomon Iyamu, made this known in a statement in Ado Ekiti on Thursday, NAN reports. Iyamu explained that the bus and occupants were arrested at Afao-Ekiti in Irepodun/Ifelodun Local Government Area (LGA) of Ekiti, having traveled through bush paths and abandoned roads from Ilorin, Kwara to Ado Ekiti at night. He said â€œLuck ran out on the travelers when the Intelligence Unit of the command traced them from Igbemo-Ekiti to Afao Ekiti, all in Irepodun/Ifelodun LGA where the commuter bus was about to discharge the passengers. The driver of the commercial bus escaped on sighting the armed squad personnel of the command but the suspects were rounded up and detained at the Headquarters of the Command in Ado Ekiti. The commandant also expressed displeasure at the rate at which people move into Ekiti from other states through the bush paths and dangerous routes in spite of the boundary closure. According to him, investigations into the case showed that the arrested travelers were from Sokoto State while few of them had been staying in Ilorin before moving to Ekiti. However, he appealed that people should learn how to stay safe from the spread of Coronavirus adding that Command was ready to arrest and prosecute anyone found in the state illegally, especially at this period of lockdown.

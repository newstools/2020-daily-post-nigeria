Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, has urged the club not to spend £20 million on striker, Odion Ighalo, to remain at Old Trafford this summer transfer window. Ighalo has impressed in his short spell at Man United since joining the club on loan from Shanghai Shenhua in January. The 30-year-old’s loan spell expires at the end of May, and the Red Devils want to see if the Premier League returns or is called over, before deciding on Ighalo’s future. Man United had been very keen to sign the 30-year-old Nigerian striker permanently, but the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has changed a lot of things. But Neville has now questioned Ighalo’s value in the current market, adding that the former Watford star is not worth the fee. “Is Ighalo worth £20m? Probably not in this market,” Neville said on Instagram Live. “He may have been if he continued scoring goals, but you probably do not need now to spend £20m.” Ighalo, who has scored four goals in eight games for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side so far this season, won Man United’s March Goal-of-the-Month Award.

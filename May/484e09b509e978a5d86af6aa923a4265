UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, says divisions and hatred still exist globally. Guterres made the remark on Friday in a video message to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The war claimed millions of lives. The UN chief warned that the coronavirus pandemic was aggravating the situation. He said it was fuelling “new efforts to divide people and spread hatred. Our world is still suffering the impact of conflict”. “Even during the current COVID-19 crisis, we see new efforts to divide people and spread hatred. At this time of remembrance and reconciliation, we pay tribute to the millions of people who lost their lives in the Second World War. “We must never forget the Holocaust and the other grave and horrendous crimes committed by the Nazis The victory over fascism and tyranny in May, 1945 marked the beginning of a new era,” he said. UN Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, Rosemary di Carlo, lamented that disturbing echoes of the past were still playing out in today’s world. “The voices of populism, authoritarianism, nationalism, and xenophobia are making themselves heard ever more loudly. We must confront those who would drag the world back to a violent and shameful past,” she said.

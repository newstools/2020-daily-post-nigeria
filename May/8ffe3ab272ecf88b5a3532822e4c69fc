The Nigerian Army has declared that the Chief Editorial Artist at BusinessDay, Mike Asukwo, was not arrested. The award-winning cartoonist is known for his works which are mostly critical of governments and their officials. In a statement on Monday, Army Director of Public Relations, Sagir Musa, recalled reports on social media that Asukwo was picked up by troops of 145 Battalion deployed at Abia Express Towers Umuahia. Asukwo, reportedly on his way from Lagos to Calabar, was allegedly detained at the military barracks in Ohafia for “defying lockdown orders”. But Sagir explained that Asukwo was only invited by the Army in Umuahia in respect of an investigation in a matter which he is privy to. The spokesman pointed out that the cartoonist himself had announced that he was not arrested. “Nigerian Army is not involved in the enforcement of lockdown and so, he was not invited or ‘arrested’ in connection with restriction of movement order as mischievously claimed or reported”, the spokesman noted. Through his Twitter account, @Asukwoeb, the journalist tweeted that he was in good condition. “I want to assure all that I am well and free. I was not arrested by the army over the lockdown. I was invited by the Army to assist in a very crucial investigation involving one of their personnel known to me”, he wrote.

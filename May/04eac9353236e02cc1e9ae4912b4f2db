Yahaya said four persons out of its 26 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were discharged after testing negative for the virus. He explained that apart from the assembly member, who died of the virus, all others were responding to treatment. “Now that results from four of them are negative and they are discharged, we now have 21 active cases in our facilities. “Though, we are still expecting more results from the samples that were taken to Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), some of the expected results were those who had contact with confirmed cases. “Thank God most of the results of the contacts came out negative, we are hopeful the remaining ones would also come out negative,” the Commissioner added.

The President of Liberia, George Weah, has ordered partial reopening of religious centres across the country, amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Weah said while mosques will reopen as from May 15, churches will reopen for services as from May 17, Reuters reports. He said religious centres would be allowed to reopen provided they obey social distancing directive. In a statement he signed, the president, however, extended the lockdown in Monrovia, the country’s capital. He disclosed that the emergency measures announced in April would be extended for two weeks. These include a ban on all movement between the country’s 15 counties, the closure of non-essential businesses, and stay-at-home orders for Monrovia’s roughly one million inhabitants. The West African country has so far recorded 199 COVID-19 cases with 20 deaths, according to Liberian authorities.

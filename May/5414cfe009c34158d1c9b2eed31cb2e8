Appreciating shareholders’ support, Adesina said he remained positive that ultimately, the bank will emerge stronger than before and continue to support Africa’s development drive.” Adesina disclosed that he draws great inspiration from his heroes, Nelson Mandela and Kofi Anan whose lives showed that people grow through pain. “I am confident that fair, transparent and just processes that respect the rules, procedures and governance systems of the bank, and the rule of law, will ultimately prove that I have not violated the code of ethics of this extraordinary institution.” He assured that he will continue to work with all shareholders to ensure that AfDB maintains its global reputation and that its credible institutional and governance systems are reinforced. The finance expert added that he would continue to work collectively with other stakeholders to fulfil the mission of the bank’s founders to accelerate and transform Africa’s development.

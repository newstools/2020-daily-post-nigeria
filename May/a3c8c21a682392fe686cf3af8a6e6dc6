Shanghai Shenhua sporting director, Zhou Jun, has said Odion Ighalo would be a perfect fit at Manchester United. However, Jun admits the Red Devils might have been affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, making it hard to sign the Nigerian on a permanent basis. Ighalo joined United on a six-month loan deal from Shanghai Shenhua in the January transfer window. The 30-year-old has gone on to score four goals from eight appearances across all competitions. However, United have to pay the £20 million Shenhua are demanding for him, to keep him beyond this season. Jun told m.ttplus.cn: “Realistically, Ighalo suits Manchester United. But many things are now uncertain due to COVID-19. “Would Manchester United be willing to spend?

Sadiya Umar Farouq, Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, has ordered relevant agencies in the ministry to distribute relief materials to Sokoto communities. This followed attacks on communities by bandits in Sabon Birnin Local Government. A statement on Saturday by the Assistant Director of Information in the Ministry, Rhoda Iliya, conveyed Farouq’s directive. It strongly condemned the killings in the affected villages. The ministry lamented that the livelihoods of residents of the communities have been disrupted and hundreds of families displaced from their homes. Farouq commiserated with the government, the people and families that lost their loved ones. “I have directed the relevant agencies of the Ministry to swiftly commence action and work in collaboration with the appropriate agencies of the Sokoto State Government in providing the much-needed relief to survivors of the attack.” She assured that the ministry will stand with the people in their hour of deprivation.

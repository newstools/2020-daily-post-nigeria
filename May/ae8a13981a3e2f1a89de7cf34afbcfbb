Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has said the energy was not right when he replaced Unai Emery at the club. Emery was fired following a seven-game winless streak. Arteta took over after Freddie Ljunberg was put in charge temporarily. His arrival from Manchester City has since brought an improvement in results at the Emirates. Speaking to Ian Wright, Arteta said: “Coming into the club in that moment wasn’t easy but you mention a key word which is ‘energy’ and I felt that the energy around the training ground and the stadium wasn’t right for this magnificent club. “I was here and was lucky to play here so everyone first of all has to feel in that way. “There was a lot of disconnection in many areas and I wanted to bring everyone together. “First of all to make everyone understand how lucky we are to be here and then a very clear direction of where we have to be.”

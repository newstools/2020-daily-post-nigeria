Kaduna State Government said that the former Secretary to the State Government, SSG, Mr. Charles Bonat, who died last Sunday, will be remembered as a voice of reason and moderation. The state government in a statement through Muyiwa Adekeye, the Special Adviser on Media and Communication to Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Monday said that the government appreciates his service to the state. According to Adekeye, the late Bonat had a rich public service career as he reached the pinnacle of the civil service at the state level as Permanent Secretary, before capping it up with a political appointment as Secretary to the Kaduna State Government, SSG. The statement explained that the deceased later crossed over to the Federal Civil Service and rose to the rank of Permanent Secretary, before retiring in 2015. The statement added, “As a retiree, Mr. Bonat sought elective office. Although that quest did not succeed, he continued to provide public service. He lent his considerable experience to the current government as a member of the Transition Committee in 2015 and 2019. He also served on the boards of some government agencies.” The statement added that Governor Nasir El-Rufai extends his condolence to Mr. Bonat’s family, and wishes them the fortitude in this sad moment, and may the Almighty God grant his soul peaceful repose.

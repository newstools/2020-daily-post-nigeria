The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has confirmed that the workers at the State House in Marina, who tested positive for COVID-19, have recovered. Sanwo-Olu revealed this during a press briefing on Sunday. On May 7, the Commissioner for Health in the state, Akin Abayomi, said that 10 persons at the State House tested positive for Coronavirus. But Sanwo-Olu delivered good news today about the workers, who have since resumed. The Governor also decided to protect the identities of those involved. “I’m sure you didn’t even transparently commend us because we wanted to be transparent, that’s why and that’s the only way we can keep it,” he said. “They are back here if I must say to you. They’ve been there, and they’ve been treated and they’ve done well and they’re back at their duty posts and I’m indeed happy that all of them are back working with me and I’m excited about that.” Lagos discharges 11 COVID-19 patients Lagos discharges 48 COVID-19 patients Coronavirus in Nigeria: Sanwo-Olu confirms discharge of 5 COVID-19 patients

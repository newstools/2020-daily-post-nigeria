U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to permanently pull funding from the World Health Organisation (WHO) if it does not commit to “major substantive improvements” within 30 days. The President disclosed this in a Four-page letter to the WHO Chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, titled “repeated missteps” which he shared on Twitter on Tuesday. According to him, the WHO shares the responsibility for the large number of deaths in the crisis. He alleged that mismanagement on the part of the WHO and reliance on information from China had dramatically worsened the epidemic and spread it globally. Trump also stated that he would make a temporary freeze of funding permanent and might also reconsider U.S. membership of the organisation at the end of the 30-day deadline if he saw no improvements. He said “The only way forward for the World Health Organisation is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China. “Discussions with the organisation on how to reform the WHO had already begun. “But action is needed quickly. We do not have time to waste. “I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organisation that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America’s interests.” Recall that the President had announced in April that he would be halting funding to the WHO while a 60- to 90-day review took place. According to him, the WHO had “failed in its basic duty” in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.

Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has blamed the deadly Coronavirus pandemic for the delay in delivering a 3-phase housing project his administration embarked on. On Tuesday, Abiodun said his administration was nearing completion of a 250-unit Prince Court Estate project at Kemta Idi-Aba in Abeokuta. “In the 1st Phase of the Project, we will be delivering 150 units at discounted rates to State workers,” he said. On Wednesday, Abiodun inspected the project, saying his administration is “working to provide affordable housing in line with our social welfare vision.” However, in a statement on Wednesday night, Abiodun revealed that 130 of the 150 units in the first phase he earlier mentioned are currently ready, saying only 130 units will be delivered by the end of the week. He maintained that the Coronavirus pandemic and its restrictions caused the delay in the completion of the housing projects. He promised that his administration would replicate similar housing projects in places like Ilaro, Ijebu-Ode, Ota and Ibafo. “I inspected the Prince Court Estate project at Kemta Idi-Aba in Abeokuta, the State Capital, and I can assure you that by the end of the week, 130 units which are currently 95% ready, will be delivered out of the 150 units of the 1st phase. “The delay in delivering the 3-phase project was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions, but when the world overcomes this invisible enemy, we will replicate such projects in cities like Ilaro, Ijebu-Ode, Sagamu, Ota and Ibafo,” he revealed. The governor said the project was executed through direct labour, using workers from the State Ministry of Housing. “We opted for not awarding the construction to any contractor, so we got experienced workers through direct labour and trained others to work with the State Ministry of Housing,” Abiodun stated.

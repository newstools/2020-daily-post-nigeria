The Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Akin Abayomi, has claimed the state is paying up to N50,000 per COVID-19 test. Abayomi revealed this on Thursday during a press briefing. The Commissioner also disclosed that over 16,000 people have been tested so far. However, the cost of testing is being borne by the state government and not individuals. “Regarding the testing, we so far have performed 16,000 tests in Lagos, which is much higher than anywhere else in Nigeria,” he said. “So, in the next month or two, we’re going to be ramping up our capacity to test. How much does it cost to test? Well, for now, the government is providing testing free of charge and the government pays about N40,000 to N50,000 per test.” Lagos State currently has the highest number of Coronavirus cases in Nigeria with 2,970.

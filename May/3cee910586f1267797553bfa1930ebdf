As Nigeria eased its strict lockdown rules on Monday, the Comptroller General, Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Mr Muhammad Babandede, has ordered the issuance of processed passports nationwide. Babandede in a statement signed by the Public Relations Officer of the service, Mr Sunday James, urged passport offices to take advantage of the Federal Government phased easing of lockdown to release processed passports to applicants. He directed that applicants be invited in batches via SMS and be mandated to be on face masks while at the passport collection offices. The statement read in part: ” NIS has directed applicants to follow the NCDC directive on social distancing, wearing of facemask, washing of hands using soap, use of hand sanitizers among others at the point of collection of the passport. “Applicants are to be invited in batches via SMS, anyone invited will show proof of invitation before they are allowed into the premises which must coincide with the date scheduled for the respective applicant to turn up and collect their passport. He warned passport applicants who do not receive SMS alerts to desist from visiting the passport offices.

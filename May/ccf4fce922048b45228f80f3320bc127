Premier League giant, Manchester United, has reportedly told Juventus to include midfielder, Adrien Rabiot, in a swap deal in order to sign their player, Paul Pogba, this summer’s transfer window. According to CalcioMercato, Man United are keen to add Rabiot to their ranks to complement Bruno Fernandes in the midfield. The Italian newspaper also reports that Juventus want to reunite with Pogba. Pogba has drawn the interest of Juventus in the past. The France World Cup winner has since expressed his desire for a new challenge in another club. Rabiot has been linked with a move away from Juventus. The 25-year-old joined Juventus from Paris Saint-Germain last summer, following a frustrating period at the Le Parc des Preinces.

President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered that Madagascar’s cure for coronavirus be picked up. Secretary to the government of the federation, Boss Mustapha, who made this known during Monday’s daily briefing of the task force, said Buhari directed the presidential task force on COVID-19 to pick up the drug, which was sent to Nigeria. DAILY POST had reported that the drug named ‘COVID Organics’ is for the prevention and cure of the disease.

Speaking on Monday, Mustapha said Madagascar donated some of the products to Nigeria through Guinea-Bissau and arrangements were being made to pick them up. He, however, stated that Buhari has ordered that the products be subjected to validation process after they have been picked up.

Kano State Government has extended the lockdown in the State by one week. The decision is to contain the spread of coronavirus. Commissioner for Information, Muhammed Garba, announced this in a statement Monday night. He explained that the action followed “due consultations with Federal Government and key stakeholders in the health sector”. Garba said the State was determined to further reduce community transmission contacts, considered as the major factor that caused the spread. The statement acknowledged the impact of the extension on the people. The commissioner, however, called for understanding, patience and support as the battle against the pandemic continued. He appealed to the public to continue observing strict personal hygiene measures, regular hand washing, use of face masks and social distancing.

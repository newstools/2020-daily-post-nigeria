Barcelona legend, Xavi, has warned the club not to make moves for Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, or Liverpool’s Sadio Mane. Barcelona has been linked with both Aubameyang and Mane this summer transfer window. But Xavi, who won three Champions League titles during his time at Camp Nou, feels both African players would not suit Barcelona’s style of football. “Mane and Aubemayang can kill you in open space,” Xavi was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “But Barcelona need players who know how to move in small spaces. “I’m thinking about a player who would adapt to Barcelona, and it is not easy to find one. “Samuel Eto’o was perfect, as is Luis Suarez right now.” Xavi added: “Football-wise, Neymar is among the three or five best in the world. I hope that he returns to Barcelona.” Eto'o advises Barcelona on summer deals for Mane, Aubameyang Xavi reveals when Barcelona captain, Messi will retire from football Xavi names only player greater than Ronaldinho

Mauricio Pochettino has admitted he believed he would replace Jose Mourinho, after the Portuguese left Real Madrid. Pochettino has often been linked with the LaLiga giants since his time in Spain. When Mourinho was still at Madrid, Pochettino was manager at Espanyol. The first rumours of Pochettino taking charge at the Bernabeu circulated during his time at Espanyol, and then later after moving to Tottenham Hotspur. Pochettino told The UK Guardian: “I always thought I’d replace him [Mourinho]. He was at Real Madrid. I said: ‘Oh, maybe one day I can take your place at Real Madrid,’ but look at how life works out. “He has taken my place at Tottenham.

One of Nigeria’s foremost Yoruba actors, Femi Oyewumi, has passed on. Popularly known as Laditi, he died at a hospital where he was rushed to. Oyewunmi suffered a chronic pain for months and had a relapse. His younger brother, Adegoke Oyewumi, confirmed the demise at the weekend. In a Facebook post, the family member wrote: “Eniba mo boda mi, Omo’ba Femi Oyewumi (Laditi) kowa bami sedaro enimi. Sunre o, omo Ajagungbade onidugbe. Good night”. The translation is: “Whoever knows my brother, Femi Oyewumi, should mourn him with me. Sleep well”. The actor, a master of stage plays and epic movies, started his career in the ’80s. Laditi featured in popular Yoruba films like Koto Orun, Aye Toto and Ija Eleye. His last major work was Ogunojalu Ogbomoso. Oyewumi is survived by his wife, children and will reportedly be buried this week in Ogbomosho, Oyo State.

Popular Nigerian singer, Timi Dakolo, has faulted the proposed relaxation of the ongoing lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States. Dakolo maintained that relaxing the lockdown despite the increasing number of COVID-19 cases was not a good idea. President Muhammadu Buhari had about a month ago ordered the lockdown in a bid to tackle the spread of Coronavirus. However, Buhari on Monday, announced gradual relaxation of the lockdown starting from May 4. Reacting to the directive, the popular singer stressed that this was not the best time to relax the lockdown, considering the increasing number of cases. In a post on his verified Twitter handle, Dakolo lamented that the non-adherence to government’s directive on social distancing could jeopardise the aim of relaxing the lockdown. According to Dakolo: “This lockdown they want to relax is not a good idea,I repeat it is not a good idea. The number are not encouraging at all and we don’t know how to ensure social distance..#myopinion “I hope you are doing the things you told yourself you would do,If you had time..I hope.” Meanwhile, confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria currently stand at 1932. This followed confirmation of 204 new COVID-19 cases in the country by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC.

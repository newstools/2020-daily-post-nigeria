Manchester City playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne, has said he could leave the club if their Champions League ban is upheld. UEFA anounnced in February, that City will be excluded from European competitions for the 2020/2021 and 2021/2022 seasons, for breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, according to findings by the UEFA Adjudicatory Chamber. The Premier League champions were also fined €30million ($33m). However, City have taken their appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS). De Bruyne admits it will be difficult to stay at the Etihad Stadium without competing in the competition for so long “The club has told us that they will appeal the decision, and they are 100% convinced that they are in the right,” he told Belgian outlet Het Laatste Nieuws. “I have confidence in my club: if they are saying it’s true, then I believe them. We’ll wait and see what happens. Once there’s a final decision I will look at it. “Two years [without Champions League football] would be long. One year is something I might be able to cope with.”

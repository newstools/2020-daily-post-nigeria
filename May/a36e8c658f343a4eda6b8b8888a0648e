In a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media, Ameh Godwin, the Senator noted with grave pain that the heavy downpour was accompanied by a heavy windstorm, which brought down over 150 buildings, valuables and several means of livelihood worth millions of naira.  He expressed great concern that the full-blown rainy season was approaching and that scores of people in the community have no roof over their heads.

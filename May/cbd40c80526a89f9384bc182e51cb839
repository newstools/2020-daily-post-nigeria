President Muhammadu Buhari has authorised the commencement of a major military operation to sweep bandits and kidnappers out of Katsina State. Buhari hailed from Daura in Katsina. This was contained in a statement on Sunday by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu. He disclosed that a proactive operation by Special Forces, which details are being kept secret, is now in progress to replace the reactive strikes against insurgent camps. Shehu said to give a full effect to the exercise, a planning team is already in the state selecting targets and making preparations for the execution of the “unprecedented” operation. “The Chief of Defence Staff, General Gabriel Olonisakin, who has been measured in issuing official statements on the oncoming exercise, briefed the President on the plan he intends to flag off shortly”, the aide noted. Buhari was quoted as expressing sadness over the recent attacks in the state.

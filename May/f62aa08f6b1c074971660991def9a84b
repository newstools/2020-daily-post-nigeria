The Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, has kicked against another nationwide lockdown in Nigeria despite the continuous rise in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. President Muhammadu Buhari had in a nationwide broadcast eased the lockdown and imposed curfew in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States. However, there have been a spike in cases in most states, especially Lagos in the past few days. As of Saturday night, Nigeria recorded another 238 cases bringing the total number of COVID-19 cases to 4151. Recall that Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu had threatened to lock down the state as he lamented non-compliance of residents to health guidelines. Speaking on the development, Keyamo said another total lockdown would be counter-productive. According to him, Nigerians need to discipline themselves to defeat the virus while going about their daily activities. He added that practicing the safety skills to defeat COVID-19 cannot be perfected if another lockdown is effected. Keyamo on his Twitter page wrote: “My personal view is that another total lockdown would be counter-productive. “Before defeating the virus, we must learn to live with it all around us and practice the skills of avoiding it like a landmine. “Practice makes perfect. We cannot perfect those skills by locking ourselves up.” COVID-19: Keyamo sends message to DSTV, MTN, others COVID-19: Leaving Oyo out of states with total lockdown poses threat  - Busari warns Buhari COVID-19 Lockdown: 'Reopening Lagos, Abuja a big risk' - Moghalu warns Buhari

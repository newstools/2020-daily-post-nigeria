Renewed cult clashes in Calabar, Cross River State have claimed no fewer than two lives. The incident which led to the murder of two young men at different locations in Calabar occurred on Friday. The first killing, DAILY POST gathered happened at the early hours of Friday while the second incident occurred around 7pm.

Confirming the incident, the State Security Adviser to Governor Ben Ayade, Ani Esin said the incidents were regrettable. Esin who spoke with our correspondent on the phone on Saturday said “I am aware of the clash which occurred yesterday (Friday) and two persons were gunned down. “The incident occurred at St Mary Street off Ekpo Abasi and Ibeku Street by Ikom Street. The cult groups trailed their suspects and hacked them down. “When I spoke with the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), he confirmed that two suspected cultists were gunned down. “The incident occurred between the Klanx and Axe members. The victims are one Klanx and one Axe. “The Community assisted in arresting one of the suspects at the scene and handed him over to the Mbukpa Police Station”. Meanwhile, Mr Esin has advised parents to monitor the activities of their children. “Those who are already there should find ways to leave the cult groups. It doesn’t pay to belong to cult groups and you don’t gain anything dead” he advised, Chika Onyesi Deputy Editor Mobile: 08033622550 Email: chika.onyesi@dailypost.ng One beheaded as rival cult groups clash in Cross River Renewed clash: Suspected cult member feared dead in Cross River Renewed cult clash reportedly claims 5 persons in Cross River

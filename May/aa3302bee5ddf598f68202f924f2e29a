The ECOWAS Commission has denied that its health institution, West Africa Health Organisation, ordered medicine developed by the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research in Madagascar for COVID-19 treatment. The President of Madagascar, Andry Rajolina, had celebrated the herbal medicine which contains artemisa at an African Union gathering. However, ECOWAS insists it would only endorse products that have been shown to be effective through scientific study. In a statement released in Abuja on Thursday, the regional body said WAHO is collaborating with relevant partners, to promote the scientific search for a cure. “We wish to dissociate ECOWAS and its health institution, West Africa Health Organization from this claim and to inform the general public that we have not ordered the said CVO medication. “We are working with member states on some of the medications available for clinical trials and for use on a compassionate basis in selected severe cases. “Some of the traditional medicine centres of excellence in the ECOWAS region are also currently investigating products of potential efficacy,” it read in part.

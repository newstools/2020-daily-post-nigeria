Barcelona legend, Xavi, has revealed the age Lionel Messi will retire from football. Xavi, who played alongside Messi at Camp Nou before he left the Blaugrana in 2015 for Al Sadd, believes the 32-year-old can continue playing until the age of 39. The Spaniard explained that Messi would lead Argentina national team to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar because the Barca number 10 always takes good care of his body. “He still got five or seven perfect years left in him,” Xavi said of Messi during an Instagram chat with another former-Barcelona striker, Samuel Eto’o. “Messi takes good care of himself, and he can keep playing until he is 37, 38, or 39. “He will play at the Qatar World Cup, I am sure.” Messi had scored 24 goals in all competitions for Barcelona so far this season before the campaign was suspended due to the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world.

Nigeria’s Minister of State for Health, Olorunnimbe Mamora, has said the World Health Organisation (WHO) cannot dictate how the country fights the COVID-19 pandemic. WHO on Monday, announced the suspension of the solidarity trial with hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 patients. The Director-General of the health agency, Tedros Ghebreyesus, explained that it was due to safety concerns. But a day later, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) insisted Nigeria would continue the trial with hydroxychloroquine. Mamora, speaking at the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 briefing on Wednesday, said WHO only provides guidelines for countries. “We are still working on drugs. Don’t forget that even the hydroxychloroquine is still being worked on as we speak. It’s important for us to make it clear that the WHO does not dictate to countries as to what to do. “They only provide guidance and guidelines, not dictate, because the reality is that each country is expected to look at those realities on ground and leave room for innovation, flexibility and adaptation as dictated by the realities on ground in each country,” he said. Nigeria currently has 8,733 confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the country. Of that number, 2,501 have been discharged, while 254 have died.

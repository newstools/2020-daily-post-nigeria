Muslim faithful have today stormed various Eid grounds for the observance of prayers across Yobe State despite COVID-19 pandemic. The Eid-El-Fitr prayer marked the end of a month-long Ramadan fast for the Islamic year 1441 After Hijrah. When DAILY POST correspondent visited Phase II Eid ground in Damaturu, most of the congregants wore their face masks as recommended for public gathering, but the proximity was to close. The worshippers were also subjected to washing of hands by members of First Aid Group of JIBWIS before they were allowed to have access to the ground. However, other preventive measures as recommended by the State COVID-19 Committee, particularly physical and social distancing were seriously violated as the prayer was conducted in a congregation. Reports from across the state also indicated that, the Eid-El-Fitr prayer was conducted peacefully while most of the COVID-19 safety protocols put in place were defied. It was gathered that special prayers and supplications were offered for divine intervention against numerous challenges bedeviling the state and the country, particularly COVID-19 and insecurity.

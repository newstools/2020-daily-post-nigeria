The Archbishop of Abuja Catholic Archdiocese, Ignatius Kaigama, has advised the federal government to take proper care of doctors in Nigeria. He observed that medical workers were getting scared of treating patients with or without coronavirus. Kaigama told the News Agency of Nigeria on Tuesday that there must be sufficient Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for medical personnel. “There should be provision for more people to get tested and healthcare workers should be equipped with PPEs so that they don’t need to run away from patients. That I have malaria may not be COVID-19″, he said. The cleric urged the government to do more to ensure adequate testing facilities and enough equipment for health workers to work with. Kaigama added that people that tested positive should be provided with good isolation centres to hasten their recovery. “If the isolation centres are not conducive, people will not be willing to open up when they are suspected to have the virus”, he said. Kaigama appealed to churches, corporate organisations, groups, and individuals to support ongoing efforts. “This is not the time to play politics, we can see that the government is interested in combating COVID-19,” the Archbishop noted. On Monday, the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 confirmed that hospitals were rejecting sick patients in Kano. Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation and PTF Chairman begged them not to neglect the treatment of other ailments as such actions could cause avoidable deaths.

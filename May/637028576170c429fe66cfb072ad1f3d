The Senior Pastor of Covenant Christian Centre, Poju Oyemade, has clarified that his recent post on the closure of churches, was posted before the Presiding Bishop of Living Faith Worldwide, David Oyedepo, gave his opinion on the matter. Oyedepo had disagreed with the ban on religious gatherings amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He claimed that the “voice of darkness” influenced the ban on gatherings in churches. Oyemade had taken a different position on the closure of churches, stating that “closing the doors of a physical building does not in any way means the closure of the anointing of the spirit from working.” In a statement on Saturday, he has now clarified that his post was not a response to Oyedepo. “My attention has been drawn to articles going around some websites that an article I wrote on how one can remain effective during these times was written in response to Bishop Oyedepo’s statement on the closure of churches. That assumption/inference is simply incorrect,” it read. “Facts can easily be verified by checking timelines. My article was written before Bishop Oyedepo spoke. I do understand that certain narratives drive traffic to websites and sowing seeds of division does attract attention. “I will like to make it clear and on record that my article was written 48 hours before he spoke. In the article, I did emphasise that criticising other ministries and churches’ operations is not a sign of strength on one’s part, so the article contradicts the conclusions being inferred,” Oyemade said.

LaLiga clubs have begun testing their players for COVID-19, SportsMail reports. Spanish football is anticipating at least 30 cases of coronavirus among its players, as they seek to restart the season next month. Barca players underwent tests on Wednesday morning, as footballers in the top two divisions prepare to return. LaLiga says only players who test positive will be quarantined and the four phases of testing, solitary training, group training, and full-squad training will go ahead. Atletico Madrid is also planning to carry out tests on players on Wednesday, while Real Madrid has already started the process. LaLiga president, Javier Tebas, has told the players that “there is more risk going to the chemist than there is going to training. “We are taking many precautions for a very safe and controlled return.”

Prof. AbdulRafi Omotosho of the Department of Islamic Law, University of Ilorin, has warned men against oppressing women in any form. He pointed out that women have rights in marriage, places of work, inheritance, divorce, custody of children, among others. On Sunday, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) quoted Omotosho as saying that men and women are allies of one another. The teacher in the Faculty of Law, UNILORIN, reiterated that equality between men and women was promoted by the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad. According to him, Prophet Muhammad, who was the chief enforcement officer, at every opportunity reminded the faithful of the rights of women. Omotosho referred people to both the Quran and hadith for more knowledge about women’s rights. The don disclosed that mothers were accorded highest respect and singled out for recognition and praise. He recalled an incident during the time of Prophet Muhammad, when asked by his companion: “If my father and mother call me, who do I answer first? “The Prophet replied, your mother and the man repeated three times and he received the same answer.” Omotosho advised organisations to become familiar with female rights and urged women to be courageous and fearless in demanding their rights.

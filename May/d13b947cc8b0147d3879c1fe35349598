Chelsea winger, Willian, is believed to be mulling over a three-year deal from Arsenal, Daily Cannon reports. Willian is set to become a free agent this summer, when his current deal runs out at Stamford Bridge. With the 2019/2020 campaign still to be concluded, players who are out of contract at the end of June pose a headache to both clubs and the Premier League. However, Arsenal are already looking at free transfers and swap deals this summer, as Mikel Arteta looks to strengthen his squad. Earlier this month, Willian admitted he had no qualms about joining another Premier League club. “It really is a hard decision. I identified myself a lot at Chelsea, I have a lot of love for everyone at the club, and the fans. “However, it is like I said before, if I leave Chelsea with no trouble and leaving the doors open, it would be fine to move to a rival club,” he said.

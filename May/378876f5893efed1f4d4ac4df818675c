US President, Donald Trump has said the dreaded Coronavirus pandemic is going to “end without a vaccine.” Trump told the press during his daily briefing at the White House at the weekend, “This is going to go away without a vaccine, it’s gonna go away, and we’re not going to see it again, hopefully, after a period of time.” He added, “You may have some flare-ups, and I guess I would expect that.” As at Friday, the deadly virus had infected at least 1.2 million people in the US killing more than 76,000. The leading expert on infectious diseases on the US COVID-19 task force, Dr. Anthony Fauci, had repeatedly said a vaccine is still at least a year to 18 months from being produced. Meanwhile, President Trump insists he relies on what doctors tell him, adding that doctors believe COVID-19 will go away but did not say if it was going to be this year. “It doesn’t mean, frankly, it’s going to be gone before the fall or after the fall, but eventually it’s going to go away. The question is whether we will need a vaccine. At some point, it will probably go away by itself.” COVID-19: Trump reveals when Coronavirus vaccine will be ready COVID-19: Sponsor vaccine production now - Bill Gates tells G-20 leaders COVID-19: Open up on how Coronavirus came about - US tells China

Forbes magazine has reversed it’s earlier rating of reality TV star, Kylie Jenner as the world’s youngest self-made billionaire. Forbes, on Friday said that it no longer believe that her net worth was that much after reviewing a financial data released by Coty Inc, which bought a 51 per cent stake in Kylie’s Cosmetics company in November 2019. DAILY POST recalls that Forbes had in March 2019 officially declared Kylie the youngest self-made billionaire of all time, snatching the title from Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg. They reported that Jenner amassed a personal net worth of $1 billion through her range of make-up, Kylie Cosmetics. However, Forbes has now estimated the net worth of Kylie who is now 22, at around $900 million. Reacting, Kylie took to her Twitter page to express disappointment over what she alleged as unproven assumption by Forbes magazine. According to her, she is blessed to have a successful business and never asked anyone to declare her as the youngest billionaire. Her tweet reads: “What am I even waking up to. I thought this was a reputable site; all I see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions… lol. I have never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. “Blessed beyond my years, I have a beautiful daughter, and a successful business and I’m doing perfectly fine. “I can name a list of 100 things more important right now than fixating on how much money I have.” 20-year-old rapper, Pop Smoke is dead Dangote breaks into list of world's top 100 richest people Kris Jenner's result for Coronavirus revealed

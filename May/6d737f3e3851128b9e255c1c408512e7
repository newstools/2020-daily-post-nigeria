Residents of Birshin Fulani village in Bauchi Local Government Area of Bauchi State have accused a construction company, Triacta Nigeria Limited of polluting their environment while blasting a rock located in the area for gravels and cracking their buildings. Speaking with journalists, some of the residents lamented that the activities of the construction company make life unbearable for them as it causes both noise and air pollutions which they alleged also pose threat to their health. Muhammad Auwal Ibrahim, a resident who spoke with DAILY POST, said that the company has been in the area for over 13 years, claiming that whenever the company wants to use dynamite to break rocks, they order them to vacate their homes, alleging that he was once beaten up by a staff of the company for refusing to leave his neighbourâ€™s house which lies few metres where the blast took place. He further alleged that the activities of the company do not only cause environmental hazards but worsen the condition of people with ailments such as asthma. Another resident, Tukur Muhammad, said despite the destruction allegedly caused by the company in the area, they lack basic amenities like water and hospital saying the company had only constructed a road linking to the palace of the district head of Birshi more than five years ago. While responding to the issue, the village head of the community, Alhaji Isah Ciroma, acknowledged the destructive activities of the company, saying they have received several complaints from residents but that they set up a community development committee that liaise with the management of Triacta Nigeria Limited to agree on the project the company will carry out as part of their social responsibilities. Also when DAILY POST contacted the company, they declined comment on the matter.

Confirmed cases of Covid-19 have risen to 85 in Kwara State, according to the latest update released on Wednesday. The total test done is now 1224, while the number of active cases has risen to 50. A total of 34 patients have been discharged, with 1083 negative tests recorded, 55 pending tests being awaited and one death recorded. Meanwhile, the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Kayode Egbetokun, has announced the discovery and closure of eight illegal routes created by transporters to smuggle passengers into the State against the Covid-19 interstate travel ban. He, therefore, suggested tougher sanctions to the state government to check violation of the interstate travel ban. Speaking at the meeting of the members of the Federal government joint technical task team, on Covid-19 to ease the challenges of movement of food and agricultural inputs in Kwara State, the CP who is the chairman of the team, said despite measures put in place by security agencies to check interstate travel ban, truck drivers keep on developing tricks to beat the security agencies, hence the need for stiff sanctions to be meted out. “I still receive reports of violations of border closure restrictions by truck drivers. We have closed eight illegal routes by truck drivers, but despite our efforts, it is not serving as a deterrent. They keep on smuggling passengers into the State with different trucks. “In fact, I am going to suggest to the State government that henceforth, any vehicle caught should be impounded and the vehicle forfeited to the State government, the driver should be convicted and sentenced, while the passengers should be conveyed back to their respective States,” Egbetokun declared.

President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday commended President of the African Development Bank, Nigeria’s Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, over the clean bill of health given him by the Board of Directors of the financial institution. This was contained in a statement sent to DAILY POST on Thursday by Garba Shehu, the President’s Spokesman. Recall that a report dated May 5, 2020, signed by Niale Kaba, Chairman of the Bureau of the Board of Governors, indicated that Dr. Adesina had been exonerated of allegations against him by whistleblowers, which were thoroughly investigated by the Ethics Committee of the Board of Directors, and a recommendation made to Governors of the African Development Bank, and African Development Fund. According to Kaba, in the report, “On the basis of the results contained in the report of the committee, I am of the view that we should adopt its conclusions by declaring that the President is totally exonerated of all the allegations made against him.” President Buhari in the statement said, “Dr. Adesina has served the African continent well, and has made his motherland proud.” He wished Adesina “greater successes in the position of responsibility he occupies.” Buhari sends message to Akinwunmi Adesina Buhari meets President of AfDB, Adeshina at Aso Rock ECOWAS endorses Adesina for second term as AFDB President

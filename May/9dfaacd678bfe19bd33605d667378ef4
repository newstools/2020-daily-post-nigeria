Former Egyptian coach, Hany Ramzy, has disclosed that Liverpool ace, Mohamed Salah, snubbed a move to Real Madrid in 2018 to stay at the Reds because he was comfortable at Anfield. Salah had only been at Liverpool for a season at the time when Real Madrid wanted to sign him. The Egyptian international had taken the Premier League by storm for Jurgen Klopp’s side, scoring 44 goals in his debut campaign. The forward took Liverpool to the Champions League final, where Real Madrid beat them. But Ramzy recalls meeting with Salah on international duty in March of 2018, long before the summer transfer window opened, and the former Chelsea and AS Roma star had already received an offer from the Los Blancos. “When I was working with Hector Cuper, we had a training camp in Switzerland [March 2018],” Ramzy told OnTime Sports via Goal. “I was talking to Mohamed Salah, and he told me that Real Madrid had sent him an offer. “The offer was really good, but Salah discussed it with Mr. Cuper and me, and he decided to stay with Liverpool because he was comfortable there.” Salah is currently on self-isolation after the Premier League was suspended due to the spread of coronavirus across the world.

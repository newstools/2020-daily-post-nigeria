Bournemouth midfielder, Philip Billing, has debunked rumours that he is interested in playing for Nigeria. In an interview with BT, he made it clear his international future lies with Denmark. Billing was born to a Nigerian father and Danish mother, making him eligible to represent both countries. The player has been called up by the Denmark senior team several times, but was a non-playing substitute six times. “It would be strange to play for Nigeria when I feel 100 percent Danish. “Of course I have Nigerian roots and I’m half Nigerian, but I was raised and born in Denmark. “I have Danish mother, Danish little brother and Danish little sister and a Nigerian father. But this is Denmark I want to play for. That’s my big dream,” Billing said.

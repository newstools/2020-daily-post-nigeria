Former Tottenham Hotspur star, Dimitar Berbatov, has urged striker, Harry Kane to make the tough decision to leave the club for Manchester United. The former Bulgaria international, who won two Premier League titles at Manchester United after leaving Tottenham to join the Red Devils in 2008, believes Kane may have to follow suit. DAILY POST recalls that Kane has drawn interest from Man United in the past few weeks. The England international, who is yet to win any silverware at Tottenham, has scored 181 goals in 278 matches for Spurs over the past six seasons. “The final step for me was joining Man United, and I knew I would be making people disappointed, especially Tottenham fans, but I was following my own path,” Berbatov told the Football Daily podcast. “I knew if I missed that chance, another one might not come. “This is how it is in football. Sometimes you need to make tough decisions. “The same exact situation is happening with Harry Kane at the moment. “He is in the same situation as I was in, and he has started asking questions, and maybe his head is not in the right place just like my head was not in the right place then. “The lack of trophies is the main problem for players like Kane. “He is not getting any younger. He wants to look back and know he won trophies. “When I see Tottenham play Man United now, even if on paper Spurs have better players, they still go there with fear,” he said.

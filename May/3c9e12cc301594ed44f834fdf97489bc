The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, on Sunday reiterated that the Special Public Works Programme, SPWP, was designed for unskilled rural workers. Keyamo make the clarification while insisting that SPWP was not designed for graduates. In a series of tweets, the Minister explained that the programme was meant for those looking for manual work on a daily basis. He wrote: “Let’s kindly note that the Special Public Works Programme is DESIGNED largely for UNSKILLED, ITINERANT, rural workers, NOT GRADUATES – those who look for manual work to do everyday. They are a vital part of society too and govt has decided to seek them out to cater for them. “Whilst the workers would be largely UNSKILLED, we shall recruit few skilled labour who would do specialized work like carpentry, painting, masonry etc, depending on the specific needs of some LGAs. So it’s just mischievous for some to keep harping that we want to clear gutters. “The SPWP may become an annual dry-season event. It would greatly aid the very poor amongst us. It was one of the many templates India and Bangladesh used to lift themselves in the global poverty index. The exit strategy may involve moving the workers to some agricultural.” Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had in April given approval for the recruitment of 774,000 Nigerians as part of the programme. SPWP is a programme implemented by the National Directorate of Employment (NDE). Revealing how the recruits would be picked, the Minister had a few days ago disclosed that 10 per cent of the federal government’s 774,000 temporary employment slots, will be allotted to political office holders in Nigeria.

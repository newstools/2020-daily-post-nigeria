West Brom defender, Semi Ajayi, has opened up on his conversation with legendary Arsenal boss, Arsene Wenger, before leaving the club. Ajayi was close to making to a first-team debut for the Gunners, with Wenger facing an injury crisis. Despite being third choice, Wenger preferred to use fullbacks in central defence, rather than give the Super Eagles star a chance to prove himself. Gabriel Paulista’s arrival from Villarreal in January 2015, eventually forced Ajayi to confront Wenger and leave the Emirates. “I was 21 yet to make my professional debut and another center back ahead of me so maybe I need to leave. I spoke to the boss Wenger, ‘what’s going on, I was third choice now, I ‘m down the pecking order and I’m at an age where I want to play and I feel like I’m ready to play’. “Wenger said if I can find another club that want to take me and I’m happy to go, he’d be happy to let me leave,” Ajayi said on Instagram Live.

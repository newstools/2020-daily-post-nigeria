Former Super Eagles centre-back, Godfrey Oboabona, has rubbished claims of former Schalke 04 forward, Chinedu Obasi, that players were told to pay a certain amount of money in exchange for making the 2014 FIFA World Cup squad in Brazil. Recall that Obasi had a few days ago claimed that he was dropped from the late Stephen Keshi’s team for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil because he refused to pay a bribe. Oboabona, who was then a player at Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) club, Sunshine stars, disclosed that players were selected based on merit by the late Keshi. According to the 29-year-old defender, the late Keshi was only very keen on selecting disciplined and well-dedicated players. “I don’t know why such accusations are coming out,” Oboabona, who now plays for Dinamo Batumi in Georgia, was quoted by AOIFootball as saying. “I was a Sunshine Stars player then and would not have had that kind of money to pay, so how will he say we paid money to be a part of the World Cup. “I, Azubuike Egwueke, Ejike Uzoenyi, Kunle Odunlami, and Chigozie Agbim were all playing in the NPFL, and the coach told us that we merited the team because we worked hard and deserved to play at the World Cup.” Meanwhile, former Keshi’s assistant, Daniel Amokachi, has since reacted to Obasi’s claim. Amokachi said: “Why come forward with such now when the man in charge is no longer alive to answer it?” “Even look at it, this happened in 2014 and 6 years later, you are coming forward with such claims. “Why wait until now? It does not make sense to bring such an issue when the head is no longer alive to respond to you?” I dumped Super Eagles of Nigeria because of late Stephen Keshi – Taiye Taiwo Crisis rocks Ondo football agency as ex-players disrupt Sunshine Stars' training session Isaac Promise’s Burial: NFF explains why it stayed away

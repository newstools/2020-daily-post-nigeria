The United Kingdom (UK) government has given the English Premier League (EPL) the green light to restart the season from June 1, according to Sky Sports. DAILY POST had reported that the Premier League is currently suspended indefinitely, with nine matches remaining due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Premier League and all other top-level sports in England could restart behind closed doors next month without spectators to attend venues until a coronavirus vaccine is found. The UK government’s road map for exiting the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19 was published on Monday, setting out the conditions under which various cultural and sporting events can be safely carried out in the country. Step two of the road map, which can’t begin any earlier than June 1, includes: “permitting cultural and sporting events to take place behind-closed-doors for broadcast while avoiding the risk of large-scale social contact.” EPL: Likely resumption month for Premier League revealed COVID-19: Liverpool upset over Mayor’s comments on Premier League season Coronavirus: UEFA devise new plan to finish Champions League, Europa League

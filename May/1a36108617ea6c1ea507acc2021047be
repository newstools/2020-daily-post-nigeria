The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, on Tuesday said South East leaders will soon unveil the new President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. OYC disclosed that a replacement for Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s President-General, Nnia Nwodo has been picked and would soon be made public. The group stated this in a statement signed and sent to DAILY POST by its President General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro. Isiguzoro disclosed that OYC was privy to the ongoing talks amongst Igbo leaders, political parties’ leaders, traditional rulers, captain of industries, and other stakeholders on the new developments of the registered Ohanaeze Ndigbo, and the end of alleged impunity and recklessness that characterized the former President General’s regime. According to Isiguzoro, ” I can authoritatively inform the general public, that sooner than later, Igbo leaders will present the New President General, the replacement of Nnia Nwodo, whose illegitimate reign had ended shamelessly. “There will be a consultative meeting to be summoned by BOT Chairman, thereafter, the new spokesman will unveil the new Exco of Ohanaeze Ndigbo General Assembly. “We, thereby, use this medium to inform the general public, especially the press, to disregard any publications emanating from Nwodo and his uninformed publicity secretaries, as such media publications are invalid, as they no longer speak for Ndigbo, but their individual opinions.” 2023: Igbo groups back OYC, chide Ohanaeze on State creation Fresh crisis hits Ohanaeze over reported suspension of chieftains New Ohanaeze Ndigbo emerges

The Senator representing Kogi West, Smart Adeyemi, has said he feels pity for President Muhammadu Buhari, because of the crashing prices of crude oil. Adeyemi made this comment, while contributing to a debate on the revised 2020 budget on the floor of the Senate on Thursday. According to the lawmaker, when Nigeria sold crude oil at a higher rate, previous administrations refused to diversify the economy. “When we were asking the government of the day at that time, to diversify the economy. At the time oil was selling at $100 to $150, that party, squandered our resources. “Roads were not built, road lines were not constructed, where did the money go? Who were the people who were in charge of our resources? “I pity this president, I pity this government now that oil is now selling at $22 or $30,” Adeyemi said. The Senate today, reconvened to consider Buhari’s request for approval of the N10.51tr revised 2020 budget. The Bill to amend the 2020 appropriation act, was considered immediately after the president’s letter was read during plenary by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan.

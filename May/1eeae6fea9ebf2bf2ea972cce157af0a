Super Eagles goalkeeper, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, has said he is very keen to join Odion Ighalo at Manchester United. Speaking to the Super Eagles Media Team in an Instagram Live, Ezenwa named United as his favourite club in the English Premier League, but has admitted that he supported Real Madrid growing up. The Heartland stopper maintains a good relationship with Ighalo and both players roomed together, before the 30-year-old striker retired from international football. “I will join my friend ‘Mummy’ Ighalo in Manchester United’, it is possible. “I supported Real Madrid growing up,” Ezenwa replied when asked about his favourite teams. On his most difficult teammate in training sessions, he said: “There are two but I’ll choose one, Ighalo. Any training session, he teases me my neck must shake and even though we have trained and trained at the tail end he’ll score.”

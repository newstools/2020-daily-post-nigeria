Juventus forward, Paulo Dybala has welcomed Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, to Allianz. Dybala, a former teammate with Pogba at Juve, said he would love to play alongside Pogba again amid interest linking the France World Cup winner with a return to Turin this summer transfer window. The Argentine international, who recently recovered from Coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, said this while he was highlighting his positive relationship with Pogba while showing off a collection of match-worn shirts on UEFA’s official website. “I could not overlook a shirt like this, of course,” Dybala said as quoted by Goal, referring to a Manchester United shirt from Juventus’ 1-0 Champions League win at Old Trafford in 2018. “It is from Manchester, from my friend Paul Pogba, whom I admire as a person even more than as a football player. “I had the chance to share great things with him, and hopefully, I can repeat that someday.” Transfer: Valverde reveals what will happen if Pogba joins Real Madrid Transfer: Pogba tipped to join Ronaldo at Juventus EPL: Claudio Marchisio tells Man Utd midfielder to leave club

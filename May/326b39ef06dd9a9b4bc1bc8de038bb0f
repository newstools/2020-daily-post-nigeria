Liverpool FC says they are disappointed over comments by the city’s Mayor, Joe Anderson, on the 2019/20 Premier League season. Anderson had on Thursday told BBC that the Premier League should not restart the season even behind-closed-doors because of the risk of supporters gathering outside Anfield. Liverpool had 25 points clear ahead of second-place Manchester City on the Premier League table, with nine matches remaining before the season was suspended indefinitely due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic across the globe. Reacting to the development, Liverpool, in a statement on its official website, said: “As a club, we are aware of and disappointed by comments attributed to Mayor Joe Anderson in a media interview which was published on Thursday. “As well as a lack of evidence to support such claims, we would also point to recent discussions with Mayor Anderson relating to the possibility of any behind-closed-doors game, which concluded that it’s essential that key stakeholders across the city continue to engage and work collaboratively. “We have engaged with supporters’ groups in recent weeks, and they told us of their determination to respect social distancing rules and, in the event of a resumption of football being announced. “As part of our ongoing operations, we are regularly in contact with the Mayor and his office, and we hope these conversations can continue.”

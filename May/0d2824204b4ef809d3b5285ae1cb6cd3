The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has commenced fumigation of airports in Lagos, Abuja and Port-Harcourt. Henrietta Yakubu, General Manager, Corporate Affairs of FAAN, announced this in a statement on Tuesday. She explained that the fumigation exercise was in line with the efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus. Noting that it was not yet clear when the ban on flights would be lifted, the authority was taking the proactive steps. “This is to ensure the safety of passengers and other airport users when the airports eventually reopen. In March this year, the authority embarked on a similar exercise of disinfection and fumigation.” The ongoing fumigation could mean that local flight operations may resume soon. The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 on May 6 announced the extension of ban on flight operations by four weeks. The ban expires first week of June.

210 Almajiri returnees, sent into compulsory isolation in Kaduna State for fear of coronavirus have been discharged. The 210 children who have completed their two weeks quarantine are part of the 680 Almajiris returned from neighbouring states to Kaduna. Hafsat Baba, the State Commissioner for Human Services and Social Development said after completing the two weeks, they tested negative from the Coronavirus. The discharged children, according to the Commissioner, are the Almajiris repatriated from Plateau, Kano, Gombe, Niger and Bauchi states. The Commissioner explained that the children would be handed over to respective local government chairmen to further hand them over to their parents. She further explained, “These children were from Makarfi, Ikara, Zaria, Kudan and Giwa local government areas of the state and were brought back from Bauchi, Niger, Plateau, Kano and Gombe states.” The Commissioner said that those that have tested positive have been isolated while those who tested negative would go home and be reunited with their families. The commissioner said the children would not be allowed to beg anymore in the state because the government has already banned the Almajiri system in the state. She explained that the government would ensure the children get western education as they continue with their Islamic education, stressing that the state government will not abandon them as they return home. 600 Almajiris being tested for coronavirus in Jigawa- Gov Badaru COVID-19: 67 Almajiri children, 2 policemen infected by Coronavirus in Kaduna COVID-19: 16 out of 45 Almajiris returned to Jigawa test positive

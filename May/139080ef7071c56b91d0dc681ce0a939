The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has described as fraud, the plan of the Federal Government to continue the homegrown school feeding programme during this ongoing COVID-19 lockdown. NANS condemned in totality, the proposed plan to spend N13.5 billion on feeding school children at a time schools are shut down nationwide. In a statement made available to DAILY POST on Thursday by NANS National Public Relations Officer, Comrade Azeez Adeyemi in Abeokuta, the association said the Federal Government’s decision to continue with the school feeding programme even as schools are not opened was, “an avenue to further drain lean the resources of the country.” Adeyemi alleged that the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouq’s announcement that the Federal Government would continue with the school feeding programme this time was also an attempt to ridicule Nigeria. “The Federal Government’s insistence to go ahead with the school feeding programme despite criticism by Nigerians, especially stakeholders in the education sector has shown that the programme is another way of perpetrating fraud on another large scale.” He sought to know the rationale behind the continuation of the programme “when priority of the government should be on finding a cure for the deadly coronavirus pandemic.” NANS suspected that the continuation of feeding school children at their homes was another “sham,” adding that it was also a “smokescreen to deceive Nigerians.” While calling for the suspension of what he called the, “structured daily looting and fraud” under the guise of home feeding of pupils, Adeyemi asked where the money for the programme came from. NANS questioned the source of the proposed N697 million to be spent daily on the school feeding programme, describing the decision as not only “reckless spending, but also a misplaced priority.”

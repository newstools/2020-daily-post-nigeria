Convener of pro-democracy group, Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju has reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari’s appointment of Prof. Ibrahim Gambari as his new Chief of Staff. Adeyanju claimed that Gambari was a member of the cabal allegedly headed by Buhari himself. In a tweet, the activist alleged that Gambari had been with Buhari for over 40 years even before the president married Aisha. He wrote: “Didn’t I say the CoS that will be appointed will make Abba Kyari look like a saint? “The new Chief of Staff is a member of the cabal. He has been with Buhari for over 40 years even before he married Aisha Buhari. Bury all the conspiracy theories. Buhari is the cabal.” Gambari was appointed to replace Abba Kyari who died of coronavirus about a month ago.

The Defence Headquarters has said that several Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) have been neutralized in an airstrike executed by the Air Component of Operation Lafiya Dole (OPLD) at Parisu in the Sambisa Forest area of Borno State. Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, disclosed this in a statement on Friday. Enenche, who said that the mission was conducted on April 30, added that the terrorists’ structures and logistics supplies were also destroyed. According to him, the airstrikes were conducted after intelligence reports showed that Boko Haram members had continued to use a settlement as a staging area to carry out attacks against nearby troops’ locations. “In furtherance of its objective of restoring peace and security in the North East of the country, the armed forces of Nigeria, through the Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE, April 30, 2020, neutralized some Boko Haram Terrorists, BHTs, and also destroyed some of their logistics facilities at Parisu in the Sambisa Forest area of Borno State,” the statement read. “The airstrike was conducted after intelligence reports showed that the terrorists had resumed use of the settlement as a staging area to launch out attacks against nearby troops’ locations. “Consequently, the Air Task Force dispatched its fighter jets to attack the location. “The Nigerian Air Force, NAF, jets, while taking turns to engage the target area, scored accurate bomb and rocket strikes, resulting in the destruction of some of the structures as well as the killing of several terrorists. “The armed forces of Nigeria will continue to sustain the offensive against the enemies of the country until peace and normalcy are restored in all parts of Nigeria.” See Video…   #Boko Haram : Moment #NigerianAirforce struck, killed terrorists and destroyed logistics facilities in #BornoState A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on May 2, 2020 at 5:09am PDT

Medical doctors in Kwara State in the frontline against COVID-19 are being paid N25,000 daily by the state government. Also, other categories of health care workers in the frontline are getting varying allowances daily as encouragement for them to do more. The state chairman of the Nigeria Medical Association, NMA, Dr Muhammed Kolade Solagberu, disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday, in Ilorin, the state capital, thanking Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq for fulfilling his promise to pay decent allowances to all health workers involved in the Covid-19 campaign. “This is to appreciate Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq, who has kept to his words by fulfilling all promises, especially the recently disbursed financial motivations to the frontline health care workers in Kwara state who are actively involved in facing the Covid-19 challenge in the state,” Dr Solagberu stated. “This is no doubt motivating and an impetus towards driving the ready spirit of the health workers,” he added. Meanwhile, the state government has commended the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, for its technical support for the state’s medical team, saying the body’s delegation would be leaving Kwara state better prepared to manage Covid-19 and similar cases in the future. In a letter addressed to the team on behalf of Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq and the people of Kwara state, the Deputy Governor and Chairman of the state COVID-19 Technical Committee, Mr. Kayode Alabi, expressed appreciation for the noble contribution of the NCDC while in the state; particularly in the fight against COVID-19. The team departed the state on Tuesday according to a statement in Ilorin, by the spokesman of the state Covid-19 technical committee, Rafiu Ajakaye. The NCDC delegation led by Dr Shuaib Belgore, arrived Kwara State a few weeks ago to drill the state’s medical team on the handling of the pandemic resulting in strengthened capacity and capability of the state to tackle the pandemic.

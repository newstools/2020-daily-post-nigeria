The United Kingdom has declared that from June 8, all travellers from abroad must self-isolate for two weeks. Dpa reports that Britain’s Home, Secretary Priti Patel, made the announcement at a news conference on Friday. He explained that the government hoped to prevent new infections from abroad, and a second wave of infections. Travellers must provide an address and contact details where they intend to stay. Individuals that fail to go into quarantine could be fined up to £1,000. Government says the rule applies to all people entering the country, aside from travellers from Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. Airlines UK, the trade association for UK-registered airlines, had kicked against the regulation. In an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, warned that an open-ended quarantine, with no set end date, “will make an already critical situation for UK aviation, and all the businesses we support, even worse”. The group noted that people will simply choose not to travel to and from the UK. The industry players said “economies in Europe and around the world begin opening up their borders and removing their own quarantines – making the UK aviation sector unable to compete”.

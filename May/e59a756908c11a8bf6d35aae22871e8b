Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has advised the special adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina “to quit the office if he could not manage Nigerians.” Adesina had stated in a live broadcast with ‘Nigeria Info’s Morning Crossfire Programme’ that nobody had authority to order President Buhari around. In his reaction, Giwa, in a statement to DAILY POST on Friday, urged Adesina to caution himself from addressing Nigerians carelessly. He said, “I watched the interview, and I can tell you that Mr. Adesina is not a good manager. “We are citizens of Nigeria and everyone has the right to question president Buhari if he fails to address some burning issues. “As a sitting president of Nigeria, he is answerable to the people not to Adesina. Nigerians must be able to tell him what they want. “Mr. Adesina should learn from Olusegun Adeniyi and Reuben Abati. “There is a way you talk to people to show respect for their persons. Adesina has no respect for Nigerians.” Why Buhari can't succeed - Jonathan's ex-aide, Omokri Nnamdi Kanu: Presidency has admitted that Buhari is deceiving Nigerians - IPOB Buhari's spokesperson, Adesina under fire for promoting president's military regime

Chelsea has decided that the club will continue to lend full support to its midfielder, N’Golo Kante, after the 29-year-old decided to stay away from the club’s training due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. According to The Sun, Chelsea could even permit Kante to miss the rest of the Premier League campaign. Kante’s season had already been interrupted by a series of minor injuries. DAILY POST had reported that Kante expressed safety concerns over a return to Chelsea’s training amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The France World Cup winner decided against training on Wednesday. The former Leicester City star lost his older brother to a heart attack just weeks before the 2018 World Cup, and a few months earlier, the player himself fainted in training before being given a clean bill of health. Meanwhile, Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard, had admitted earlier this month that he felt sorry for his overworked Kante. Lampard said: “N’Golo Kante has played four or five incredible seasons in terms of his success and he has been used quite rightly by his managers a lot. “This season he’s played only about 40% of our games, and even then it’s been difficult for him, and I have felt for him on an individual level.” COVID-19: Kante decides to stay away from Chelsea training Chelsea coach, Lampard sympathises with Kante Chelsea: Conte agrees with Lampard on Kante’s position

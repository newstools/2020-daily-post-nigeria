Juventus have offered Miralem Pjanic, Mattia De Sciglio and alongside €25 million to Barcelona for their right-back, Nelson Semedo. According to the Spanish newspaper, Sport, Juventus and Barcelona have reached “an agreement in principle” for Semedo to move to Turin this summer transfer window. Pjanic and De Sciglio have reportedly already said yes to Barcelona, while Juve is trying to finalise a deal that will see Semedo join Maurizio Sarri’s side at the end of the season. Pjanic has been linked with a move away from Juve at the end of the season. The Bosnia and Herzegovina midfielder currently has one year left on his current deal with Juventus. Semedo has also been linked with a move away from Camp Nou this summer. The defender has not really lived up to expectations at Barca since joining the club from Benfica in 2017.

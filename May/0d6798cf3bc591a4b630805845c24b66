Chelsea are interested in Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi, but face competition from Real Madrid, according to Mundo Deportivo. Ndidi has impressed at the King Power, since the former Premier League champions bought him in January 2017 to replace N’Golo Kante. The Nigerian enforcer Ndidi could now join Kante at Stamford Bridge, as he has emerged as a target for the Blues. Frank Lampard could need a new defensive midfielder, if Jorginho leaves for Juventus to reunite with Maurizio Sarri. Ndidi is valued at no more than €40m and the Foxes would be willing to make some money on the 23-year-old. The players who is under contract until 2024, is also attracting interest from Paris Saint-Germain.

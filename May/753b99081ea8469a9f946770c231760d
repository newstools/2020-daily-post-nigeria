President Muhammadu Buhari has picked a new Chief of Staff from the list of 14 names submitted to him. The president had to take the decision after a long wait, the Nation reports. It is believed that Buhari settled for Prof. Ibrahim Agboola Gambari as a replacement for the late Abba Kyari. Kyari served in the position from 2015 and died April 17 this year from COVID-19 complications. Gambari was Buhari’s Minister of External (Foreign) Affairs during his time as Military Head of State between January 1984 and August 1985. When DAILY POST contacted presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, he did not confirm or deny the appointment. In a text message, Shehu wrote: “I have not been briefed.” It is believed that an official announcement will be made at the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting today. The FEC meeting will be the first after weeks of partial lockdown of the State House since March.

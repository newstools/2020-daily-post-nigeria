The Police in Ogun State have arrested a commercial driver, who they alleged connived with his friend to kill a businesswoman and made away with her N400,000. DAILY POST learnt that the accused driver, Gbenga Ogungbemi, his friend, Tosin Olobamoyo, allegedly murdered the victim while she was going to Ire-Ekiti to buy palm oil. The police said they dumped her corpse in a bush along the Sagamu-Benin Expressway. Ogun Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident in a statement on Tuesday. According to Oyeyemi, the victim, Evelyn Ebere, was a trader who was residing in Sagamu Local Government Area of Ogun state. Oyeyemi disclosed that the suspects were arrested when Ebere was nowhere to be found. The anti-kidnapping unit of the command, DAILY POST learnt, had embarked on intelligence and technical-based investigation, which led to the arrest of the driver and his friend. “On interrogation, Gbenga informed the detectives that he is the driver of a Toyota Carina car with number plate AGD 107 GU, with which he was hired to convey the victim to Ire-Ekiti on a charter arrangement, where she intended to buy 26 kegs of palm oil’. Oyeyemi said. The suspects were said to have driven the woman into a bush where they dispossessed her of the N400,000 she had budgeted for the 26 kegs of palm oil. Being a regular customer of Gbenga, who knew him very well, Oyeyemi said “they decided to kill her and dump her corpse in the bush.” Meanwhile, the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, while commending the anti-kidnapping team for the intelligence-based investigation, ordered that the suspects be prosecuted as soon as investigation is concluded.

Arsenal are negotiating a swap deal with AS Roma about the possibility of attacking midfielder, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, joining the Serie A giants permanently this summer transfer window. According to the Daily Mirror, Arsenal is ready to cut ties with the Armenian international to raise funds for coach Mikel Arteta to make his own signings this summer. Mkhitaryan has spent the current campaign out on loan in Roma. Roma has repeatedly made it clear that they would like Mkhitaryan back at the Stadio Olimpico next season. Mkhitaryan has a year left on his current contract with Arsenal, and the Gunners will be keen to sell the playmaker at a high fee. Arsenal value Mkhitaryan at around £10million, but Roma’s valuation is even lower than that. The North London club and Roma have been discussing a potential player-plus-cash deal for the 31-year-old.

Former Manchester United midfielder, Owen Hargreaves, has advised the club to sign striker, Odion Ighalo, on a permanent transfer. Ighalo has impressed in his short spell at Old Trafford since joining Man United on loan from Shanghai Shenhua in January. The 30-year-old’s loan spell expires at the end of May, and United want to see if the Premier League returns or is called over, before deciding on Ighalo’s future. But Owen expects the Red Devils to pursue a permanent deal for the Nigerian star despite having Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial at their disposal. “I think Ighalo has been a good fit for Man United and when you sign players you have got to get the right fit,” Owen told talkSPORT. “It is not always about getting the best name. It is about getting the guy that you do not have that you need. “He has given them something different. “Hopefully he stays, but there is the whole Sanchez situation when he comes back, Martial and Rashford, he is fit as well, Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba – you have got to get them all into a team, with Daniel James as well. “So he has been good, really good. I am sure they will try, if it is sensible, keep him longer. I would be surprised if he left.” Ighalo has scored four goals in eight games for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side so far this season. The former Watford attacker won Man United’s March Goal-of-the-Month Award.

Barcelona manager, Quique Setien, has claimed the introduction of five substitutes, will work against his side. LaLiga resumes June 11, three months after it was suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the break, football lawmakers, the International Football Association Board [IFAB] announced three temporary changes. The changes will be active in all competitions which start and finish before the end of 2020. “I think having five substitutes could actually be detrimental to us because of the way we play,” Setien told the Las Palmas Football Federation. “We know that a lot of the times we resolve matches in the latter stages of the game. Therefore, if you give the opposition the option of putting on fresh players during that time, the weakness that is generated, by tiring their players, won’t happen to the same degree.” Quique Setién: Ten things you need to know about Barcelona new manager LaLiga: Barcelona still missing things despite 3-2 win over Real Betis – Quique Setien LaLiga: What Setién said about De Jong after Barcelona’s 2-0 defeat to Valencia

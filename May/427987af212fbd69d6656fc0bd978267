The Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje has disclosed why the state experienced mysterious deaths in the past weeks. Ganduje, who spoke through one of his Media Aides, Salisu Yakasai explained that preliminary investigations showed the victims died from malaria and cerebrospinal Meningitis. Speaking during an interview on a German-based radio, DW Hausa, on Friday, the governor said most of the deceased according to investigation showed that they had underlying medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, among others. He said the victims “died due to inadequate medical attention from the government-owned and private health facilities in the state amidst fear of COVID-19 infection. “These are categories of people that need special attention which they are no longer having from the health personnel because of fear of coronavirus.” He stated that the non-functionality of private hospitals due to Coronavirus outbreak could have added to the high rate of fatalities in the state.

Another Premier League player has tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19). Brighton Football Club’s CEO, Paul Barber, disclosed this on Sunday during an interview with Sky Sports News. According to Barber, the Premier League player that tested positive for COVID-19 was a Brighton player (name withheld). The unnamed Brighton player will go into 14-day isolation while he recovers from the virus. “Despite all the measures that we’ve been taking over the past few weeks, where the players have not been involved in any significant training at all, we’ve still suffered another player testing positive for the virus,” Barber said. “There are concerns, and I think it’s normal for all clubs to have those concerns. “We want to make sure we do everything that we can to ensure those protocols are in place and are safe and secure and mitigate the risk as far as we can.” This is coming just 24 hours before the 20 Premier League clubs’ meeting for a crunch vote to decide whether to resume the English top-flight league or not.

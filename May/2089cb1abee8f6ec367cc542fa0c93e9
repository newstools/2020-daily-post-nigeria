Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has identified Paris Saint-Germain forwards, Kylian Mbappe and Neymar as the natural successor of Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, and Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d’Or (World Best Player award). Messi and Ronaldo are two of the best players in the history of the game. The pair had won eleven of the last 12 Ballon d’Or awards. But Wenger believes both the France international and the Brazilian international are the two obvious choices to take over from Messi, 32, and Ronaldo, 35, as the best players in the world. Wenger told talkSPORT: “Lionel Messi, we have never seen players like that who can absolutely be creative in any tight situation. “These players, Messi and Ronaldo are now getting to an end. “It is now about the next generation, and the next generation may be French. “At the moment, the leader could be Mbappe, and Of course, Neymar, we know. “But England, I believe, has a good chance. Now they are doing very well at the youth level. “They have done well with Gareth Southgate at the World Cup. I was hoping at the European Championship they would be one of the contenders.” Ballon d’Or: Unai Emery reveals player to take over from Messi, Ronaldo Pele chooses Ronaldo over Messi as best football player Ballon d'Or: Luka Modric criticise Cristiano Ronaldo over absence at event as Messi swooped award

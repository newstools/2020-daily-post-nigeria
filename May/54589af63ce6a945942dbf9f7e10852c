Bayern Munich attacking midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, wants a move to Chelsea this summer transfer window. DAILY POST recalls that Coutinho had drawn the interest of Chelsea in the past few weeks. The Brazilian international is currently on loan at Bayern Munich from Barcelona until the end of the season. Coutinho has struggled to find his top form since his £142million move to Barcelona from Liverpool in 2018. But according to Mundo Deportivo, the 27-year-old has the preference to join Frank Lampard’s side despite the interest from several other Premier League sides. Barcelona could demand between £72million to £81million for the playmaker, and they would be willing to accept offers from any interested clubs. Coutinho has scored nine goals and provided eight assists from 32 appearances in all competitions for Bayern so far this season.

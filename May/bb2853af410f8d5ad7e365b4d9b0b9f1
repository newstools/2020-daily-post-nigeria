The Chairman of the Lagos chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW), Musiliu Akinsanya better known as MC Oluomo, has insisted that he is not interested in going into politics. MC Olumo stated this while speaking on Funmi Iyanda’s talk show, ‘Public Eye’, on Friday. According to him, he would prefer his kids to contest for political positions. “The profession I learned is driving. And that has brought me success and given me control over unions in Lagos. Tomorrow, a child of mine might decide to go for a political post in Nigeria. “I believe anyone can do what pleases them. But count me out. I’m not going for the reps or senator seat. But I’m in full support of the Lagos government,” MC Oluomo said.

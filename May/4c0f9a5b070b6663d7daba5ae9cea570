Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, Thursday, hailed President Muhammadu Buhari over the appointment of Prof. Ibrahim Gambari as his Chief of Staff. Oyegun also affirmed that the appointment was one of the best made by the President. The erstwhile National Chairman of the ruling party who reacted to the appointment said it would change governance and Diplomatic relationship of the present administration. He further described the former Minister of External Affairs as one of the most experienced Nigerians alive. According to Oyegun, “The international reach of the former United Nations administrator has no equal in the country as he can call any President or Head of State in the world”. He, however, congratulated President Buhari for finding an asset like Gambari to add to his government. He added, “l am celebrating the appointment of Prof. Gambari. He is one of the most experienced Nigerians alive and he would be of tremendous assets to the administration and to the Nigeria nation in every respect. “He has international reach, so he can virtually pick his phone and call any head of state or President in the world. “We pray for him. His reputation is such that he can’t afford not to make this administration not to succeed. He is a very humble person that will bring value to this administration and will make it succeed where others may have failed. “With his achievements and experience, he is still very, very humble. I congratulate the President for managing to get him.” But DAILY POST recalls that the appointment of Gambari from Kwara State as CoS to the President has brought different concerns, as some persons have criticised it based on his relationship with the former military dictators. It would, however, be noted that the International Diplomat replaces the late Abba Kyari who died while he served as Chief of Staff to Buhari.

The Young Nigerian Professionals (YNP) have reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari’s nomination of career diplomats as Ambassadors-designate. Their reaction was contained in a statement on Friday, signed by the Chairman, Charles Folayan. The group said it was confident that the nominees were capable and would help to deliver President Buhari’s policies at the global arena. “The nominees are seasoned diplomats, who have served in various countries with distinction. They are good men and women with the highest sense of commitment and responsibility”, he said. YNP noted that it had interacted with I. A. Yusuf, a nominee from Kogi State and described him as a patriotic Nigerian with integrity. “We know him for his exemplary character, integrity and his positive disposition towards Nigerians in his host countries, especially the students and professionals. He offers help with ease, to anyone who demands help,” he added. The professionals said they believed that all the appointees would bring to Nigeria, the benefits of their abundant network of relationships across the world. The statement urged them to “remain steadfast to the values that saw them rise to where they are”. Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, had forwarded the President’s request to the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

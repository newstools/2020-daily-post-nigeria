Inter Milan manager, Antonio Conte, has paid tribute to Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard in recognition of the 41-year-old’s remarkable debut season at Stamford Bridge. Lampard returned to Stamford Bridge as a manager in the summer of 2019, having impressed in his first season in management at Championship side, Derby County. Chelsea had largely thrived under Lampard so far this season before the campaign was suspended due to the coronavirus outbreak.  The Blues sit in the fourth position on the Premier League table and also reached the knockout stages of the UEFA Champions League. But Conte, who also coached Chelsea in the past, believes Lampard can become one of the best managers in the world. “I think he’s doing a really good job,” Conte told Sky Sports. “This is Frank’s second experience after Derby. To manage and be the coach of a top team is not easy. “But I think he has the skills and the ability to become one of the best managers in the world. “It was a crucial moment for the team and me. “He has to continue to work in this way, and I wish him the best for the future.” EPL: Lampard confirms Victor Moses’ return to Chelsea Chelsea vs Tottenham Hotspur: Lampard hails Mourinho Transfer: Marcos Alonso set for shock move to new club from Chelsea

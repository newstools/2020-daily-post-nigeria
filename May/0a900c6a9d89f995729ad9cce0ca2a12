Former Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has backed Bayern Munich to win the UEFA Champions League trophy this year. Berbatov believes the Bundesliga champions can win the Europe top-flight tournament this season ahead of Atletico Madrid because the Bavarians have great players. Liverpool won the Champions League trophy last season. The Premier League leaders have already been knocked out of this season’s Champions League by Atletico Madrid. “Looking at this year’s Champions League, I am now leaning more towards Bayern Munich to win it, if it goes ahead,” the Bulgarian told Betfair. “Maybe because I am watching a lot of Bundesliga, but they always impress with quality football, and they have some great players. “The way they dismantled Chelsea in that last match was unbelievable, and they did it with such ease. “I also like the look of Atletico Madrid. They produce great quality of football as well. “I am not sure how the stoppage will affect everybody, but Bayern Munich may have a slight advantage because they are playing football now and they are getting their match sharpness back, I would not be surprised if they are now the favourites.” EPL: Dimitar Berbatov reveals player Chelsea should sign as Hazard’s replacement EPL: Dimitar Berbatov gives reason Man Utd should not sign Coutinho Champions League: Klopp predicts team that might take trophy from Liverpool

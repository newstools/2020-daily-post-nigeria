Ex-Everton boss and Holland manager, Ronald Koeman, has been hospitalised in Amsterdam with a heart problem. His wife, Bartina confirmed that he underwent a cardiac catheterisation after being rushed from his home to the hospital by ambulance on Sunday. It was reported that the former Barcelona player had to have a stent (a tube that keeps the blood vessel open) placed in the vein as his coronary artery was blocked. According to the Sun UK, doctors say he is in a stable condition and there is no certainty as to whether his heart problem was coronavirus related. Koeman was preparing his Holland side for Euro 2020 this summer before the Covid-19 crisis forced the tournament to be postponed a year. All international matches have since been scrapped, with leagues across Europe awaiting the fate of their current campaigns.

Leicester City head coach, Brendan Rodgers, has revealed he had the novel COVID-19 after the Premier League was suspended in March. Rodgers, who said he has now fully recovered from the virus, disclosed this in an interview with BBC radio. The 47-year-old said: “My wife and I had it [COVID-19] just after the Premier League was suspended. “One week later, I started to struggle, I had no smell and taste, and it was the same with my wife. “I could hardly walk, and It reminded me of climbing mountain Kilimanjaro, as you climb higher you get more breathless. “I went for a run, and I could not do it. I was so weak and had a weird sensation for three weeks of having no taste.” Rodgers is now the second manager in the Premier League to confirm he had the virus after Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta.

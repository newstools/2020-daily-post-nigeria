Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle, has hailed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) for exposing Chinese nationals who tried to block investigations into a shoddy contract in the state.  The suspects are Messrs Meng Wei Kun and Xu Koi. The EFCC is investigating a multi-billion Naira contract by a company they work for, China Zhonghao Nig. Ltd. The firm is handling N50billion contracts awarded by the Zamfara State Government between 2012 and 2019. The contract was for the construction of township roads in Gummi, Bukkuyun, Anka and Nasarawa towns and 168 solar-powered boreholes in 14 Local Government Areas. Matawalle, in a statement on Thursday by his spokesman, Zailani Bappa, noted that the attempted bribery confirmed his earlier accusation that the company only collected money without executing the project. The governor said the arrest further proved that his government’s claims on “atrocities perpetrated by the immediate past administration” in Zamfara State were correct. “Sometime back, I cancelled the unexecuted multi-billion Naira contract awarded to this same Chinese company and called for the refund of the money. I call on Mr President to assist the state government to fast track the retrieval of this money so that we can actually provide water and electricity to the rural areas. “It is pertinent here to call on President Muhammadu Buhari to further endorse his confidence on Mr Ibrahim Magu and his team as it is becoming obvious by the day that those calling for his removal actually have skeletons hiding in their wardrobes,” the governor stated.

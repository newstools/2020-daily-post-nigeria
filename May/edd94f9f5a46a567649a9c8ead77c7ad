Real Madrid have offered four players to Manchester United in a bid to finally land Paul Pogba, the UK Sun reports. The players include James Rodriguez and Martin Odegaard. It is understood that Lucas Vazquez and Brahim Diaz could also be thrown in as a deal sweetener. Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has remained an admirer of his compatriot, who has missed most of the Premier League season with a series of ankle issues. However, the LaLiga giants are still keen on Pogba, although United will insist he is not for sale. With the COVID-19 affecting clubs financially, Madrid will press on with their pursuit and will try to do swap deals in order to secure their targets.

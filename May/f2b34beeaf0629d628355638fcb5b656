Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has disclosed that he does not influence the club’s signing plans amid interest linking Inter Milan striker, Lautaro Martinez, with a move to Camp Nou this summer. Messi and Martinez are team-mates in the Argentina national team. DAILY POST had reported that Martinez is one of Barcelona’s top targets this summer, but the financial impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) means they are unlikely to meet the player’s £97million buy-out clause. But Messi has insisted that he does not know if there is currently a negotiation between Barcelona and Martinez, adding that the 22-year-old is a complete forward. “If I’m honest, I don’t know very well if there were negotiations right now for him [Lautaro Martinez], I’ve no idea,” the Barca number 10 told Mundo Deportivo. “I think I already mentioned it, that Lautaro is an impressive striker, mainly because I believe he is a very complete forward: he is strong, he dribbles well, he has a goal, and he knows how to protect the ball. “But well, we’ll have to see what happens finally with him,” he added.

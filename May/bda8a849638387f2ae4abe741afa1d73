Nigerian Government has announced that beneficiaries of the Social Investment Programme, N-Power, will receive their April stipend next week. The beneficiaries have been lamenting the continuous delay in the payment of their stipends for some months now. They are now clamouring for their April payment since the announcement of the lockdown in some states owing to the outbreak of coronavirus. The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, however, gave the assurance on Friday, adding that the payment process was at the final stage. Farouq, who spoke on Friday at the daily briefing by members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, said, “It is in the final stage of payment and by early next week, they will get their payment Insha Allah.” Beneficiaries of the programme had last month lamented the delay in payment of their stipends since the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, under the leadership of Hajiya Sadiya Farouq, took over the scheme.

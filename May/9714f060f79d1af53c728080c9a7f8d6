The Premier League will warn clubs at a meeting on Monday, not to vote against the season restarting at neutral venues, as it could cost them more than relegation, according to Sky Sports. The clubs in the bottom six – Brighton, West Ham, Watford, Bournemouth, Aston Villa and Norwich – have reservations about proposals to finish the season by playing at neutral grounds without fans. They believe it would deprive them of home advantage and affect their chances of survival. However, they will be warned that the protocols for games restarting could be in place for the start of next season. At least 14 clubs would need to vote in favour of the proposals before games can restart. The Premier League meeting will take place hours after the government have announced the latest review of lockdown restrictions.

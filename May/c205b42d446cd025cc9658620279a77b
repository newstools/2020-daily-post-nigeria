The All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Bola Tinubu, says Oba of Lagos, Rilwanu Aremu Akiolu, made tremendous impact on his tenure as the Lagos State Governor. He disclosed that the monarch extended the same gesture to his successors – Babatunde Fashola, Akinwunmi Ambode and the incumbent, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Tinubu said this in his message to Akiolu on his 17th coronation anniversary. The former Senator noted that Akiolu had offered focused, committed and purposeful leadership in Lagos State. He said the monarch’s reign has helped to foster peace, stability and tremendous development, as well as unity and cohesion within the traditional institution in the state. In a statement on Saturday by his spokesman, Tunde Rahman, the APC leader said the foremost traditional ruler fondly called ‘Olowo Eko,’ has led the way for other royal fathers in Lagos to follow. “He has given unwavering support to government’s policies and activities in Lagos. His wise counsel is invaluable. It helped in navigating difficult junctures during my time as governor. “In the same fashion, he has also made his tremendous experience and wisdom available for successive governors after me including the present Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.” He prayed that Akiolu’s reign will continue to bring forth peace, stability and prosperity to Lagos State. Tinubu added: “May God grant Oba Akiolu the grace of long life, good health and increased wisdom. Kabiyesi, ki ade o pe lori, ki bata o pe lese, ki esin oba o jeko pe ooo. Amin.” Tinubu sends message to Sanwo-Olu, Oluwa family of Lagos Coronavirus: Tinubu issues strong warning over spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria Agbaje speaks on Tinubu 'sponsoring' his 2019 election campaign

A Pro-Biafra group, the Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, has told the Ijaw Youth Council, IYC, to engage the Nigerian government in a civil war as Biafra did in 1967. The BNYL was responding to a statement by the Ijaw Youth Council, where the apex Niger Delta youths group told Biafra and Oduduwa secessionists to leave the Ijaw nation out of what they call ‘their utopian republics.’ The Biafra group advised the Ijaw youths to war with Nigeria government to prove that they can stand as a country. This was contained in a statement to DAILY POST on Thursday signed by Ebuta Takon Akor, Deputy National Leader of BNYL, and Director of Operations, Biafra Broadcasting Service, BBS. He said that Biafra will be restored with or without the support of the Ijaw Youth Council. “It was the mentality of some Ijaw youths that led to the reasons the government succeeded in deceiving some people in South-south to hate Biafra. “But now, the BNYL is here with overwhelming support and membership from Cross River, Bakassi Peninsula, Akwa Ibom, Rivers and even Bayelsa States.” He said Biafra is not Igbo project, adding that the Igbo are in forefront of the struggle being the majority ethnic group of Biafra.

May Allah continue to bless and comfort his gentle soul.’’ Also [paying his tribute to the late President, Atiku tweeted, “Ten years gone, yet the outstanding leadership & decision making acumen of late former President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua remains evergreen. “Nigerians will not forget his undisputable achievements, pro-masses policies & positive stance towards the rule of law.

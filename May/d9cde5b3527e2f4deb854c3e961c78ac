The President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has refused to rule out Odion Ighalo returning to the national team. However, Pinnick insisted that the 30-year-old would not be forced to reverse his decision to quit the Super Eagles. Ighalo announced his international retirement last year, after finishing as the top scorer at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. But since he made a loan switch to Manchester United in January, his impressive displays have led to calls for Ighalo to play for Nigeria again. “He grew up in Ajegunle, you know the mentality about Ajegunle and Nigeria, he loves the country so much, so I believe if there is need for him to play for Nigeria, he will come. “I am in touch with him, we speak every other week. He is quite respectful, quite disciplined and quite prayerful,” Pinnick said on Plus TV Africa. He added: “If there is need for him to come I believe he would definitely come but we don’t want to put him under pressure, we want him to concentrate.”

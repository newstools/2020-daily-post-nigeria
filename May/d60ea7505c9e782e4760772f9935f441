As part of measures to contain the invasion of coronavirus pandemic, Imo state Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has charged security agents in the state to arrest anyone who does not have their face masks on. The governor gave this instruction on Friday during a live broadcast on COVID-19 pandemic aired simultaneously on various radio and TV stations in the state. He said it had become necessary that the protective covers are made compulsory for use since medical experts have so far emphasized on its importance.

He said that social gatherings of more than 50 persons are not allowed in the state. The shutdown of markets places especially at the local levels, according to him, remains and traders are further advised to continue to comply with the directives till the virus is properly put to check. Meanwhile, Uzodinma thanked the people for their resilience and support since the lockdown, adding that it was not the governmentâ€™s making to frustrate them but to save them from the deadly scourge of coronavirus.

He promised that the government will continue to live on its promises to protect lives and property of Imo people, asking for their continued support in this trying period.

The Abuja Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Wednesday arraigned Williams Bamidele Salami over alleged issuance of N27 million dud cheque. Salami was made to appear before Justice Adepoju of the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Wuse, Abuja. EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale said this in a statement to newsmen in Abuja. The charge reads: “That you Williams Bamidele Salami (CEO/Chairman of Fishgate Technologies Limited), and Fishgate Technologies Limited in settlement of a credit obtained from Friday Olajide and Angelwalker Limited in Abuja, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, issued a Guaranty Trust Bank Plc cheque number: 49283068 in the sum of N27million (Twenty-seven million Naira) to Angelwarker Ltd; which you knew when presented within three months would be dishonoured on the ground that no sufficient funds were standing to the credit of the account upon which the cheque was drawn and you thereby committed an offense contrary Section1(1) (b) and punishable under Section 1(1) (b) (i) (ii) of Dishonoured Cheque (Offences) Act, Cap 102, Laws of the Federation, 2004.” But the defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge, prompting counsel to the EFCC, Faruk Abdullah to ask the court for a commencement date of trial. The defense counsel, Obom Benson, however, prayed the court for the defendant to continue to enjoy the administrative bail earlier granted by the EFCC, saying that such was in line with the federal government’s rule of decongesting the prisons due to COVID 19 pandemic. In his ruling, the judge granted the prayers of the defense counsel and adjourned the case to June 9, for the commencement of trial.

The Federal Government has warned Nigerians against thinking that the ease of restriction, which President Muhamadu Buhari announced last Monday is the end of the coronavirus pandemic. Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), said this at the daily media briefing of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 on Thursday. Mustapha, who is also the Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, explained that security operatives would be strictly enforcing health guidelines aimed at combating the spread of COVID-19 during the eased restriction. According to him, a copy of the guidelines will be published in the media, so every Nigerian will get to know their role in helping to curb the spread of the virus. He said: “As we approach the beginning of the first of a three-phased easing of lockdown from Monday, it’s important that Nigerians receive and digest the implementation guidelines. “It’s also important for States, law enforcement agents, trade associations, employers, businesses, and Nigerians to understand their roles, obligations, and responsibilities. “Above all, we must understand that this is a war against an unseen and potent enemy. “Nobody should mistake the easing of restrictions for permission to act without care. “The security agents have been instructed to respect the rights of citizens while also ensuring strict enforcement. “Ladies and gentlemen of the Press, as you know, our National Response is driven by strong collaboration with the sub-national levels of government. “In this, I am glad to mention that Lagos State has already adapted these implementation guidelines, while other states are also expected to follow suit shortly.”

Premier League clubs are set for a decisive vote on May 8 over playing out the rest of the 2019/2020 season, ESPN reports. However, the campaign will be played to a conclusion behind closed doors at neutral venues, if football can return safely. On Friday, all 20 teams held a meeting via video conference, where they restated their desire to resume fixtures. During the meeting, they discussed the government-backed plan for football to return this summer, named ‘Project Restart.’ The criteria included the insistence that all of the remaining 92 fixtures must be played at neutral venues. The venues include some current Premier League Stadia, Wembley Stadium and one other unnamed ground.

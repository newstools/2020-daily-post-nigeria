Barcelona are reportedly ready to sell six players – Arturo Vidal, Nelson Semedo, Jean-Clair Todibo, Rafinha, Junior Firpo, and Moussa Wague to help fund a summer rebuild amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to Mundo Deportivo. Barcelona manager, Quique Setien, is keen to add Inter Milan forward, Lautaro Martinez, to his ranks this summer transfer window. Barcelona are believed to be in talks with Inter Milan over a move for the 22-year-old Argentine international. DAILY POST had reported that Martinez is one of Barcelona’s top targets this summer, but the financial impact of the COVID-19 means they are unlikely to meet the player’s £97million buy-out clause. Meanwhile, Setien has since backed Martinez to succeed in his team at Camp Nou if he eventually joins the Blaugrana this summer. “We are all clear there are four or five footballers who play in Lautaro Martinez’s position who are extraordinary and that any of them have what it takes to play for Barcelona,” Setien told beIN Sports. “In reference to this player, he [Lautaro] is a player who can be very good in this team, as well as the others who may be at his level.” Quique Setien predicts what will happen to Lautaro Martinez at Barcelona LaLiga: Messi reveals striker that will be perfect for Barcelona Transfer: Barcelona to do Griezmann-Neymar swap with PSG

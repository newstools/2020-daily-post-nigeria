Chelsea winger, Willian, has said he would have no qualms about joining a rival club, when his deal with the Blues expires. Willian whose deal at Stamford Bridge runs out this summer, has been linked with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur. The 31-year-old has been offered a new two-year deal, but is holding out for three more years. In an interview with Brazillian YouTube channel ‘Desimpedidos’, Willian was asked about moving to either Arsenal or Tottenham once his contract with Chelsea ends. He said: “It really is a hard decision. I identified myself a lot at Chelsea, I have a lot of love for everyone at the club, and the fans. “However, it is like I said before, if I leave Chelsea with no trouble and leaving the doors open, it would be fine to move to a rival club.”

The Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) has told the National Assembly to ‘step down’ the Infectious Diseases Bill. The bill prescribes compulsory vaccination of citizens against infectious diseases, among other provisions. It has attracted a lot of criticisms, with concerns about possible human rights violation. NGF chairman, Kayode Fayemi, in a communique issued after a virtual meeting of the governors on Wednesday, asked the lawmakers to suspend the bill to give room for consultations with state governments and other stakeholders. “The Forum resolved that the Bill should be stepped down until an appropriate consultative process is held, including a public hearing to gather public opinion and concerns. “In the light of this, the Forum established a Committee comprising the Governors of Katsina, Sokoto, and Plateau to lead a consultative meeting with the leadership of the National Assembly on the proposed Control of Infectious Diseases Bill, 2020,” it read in part.

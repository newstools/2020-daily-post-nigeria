An Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) team has safely removed the unexploded long-range 122-mm rocket device fired by the Boko Haram terrorists, which landed in Bintu Sugar area of Maiduguri during their attempt to enter the state capital last night. DAILY POST gathered that two unidentified projectiles landed near a Government Forces (GF) base in Moronti. “One device landed in Ajilari Cross area and destroyed a house while the other landed in an open space in the vicinity of Bintu Sugar. “Soldiers, following the initial explosions launched artillery fire and deployed Close Air Support (CAS) towards Fuguri and also moved in a battle to stop the terrorists,” residents of Binta Sugar in Maiduguri said. It could be recalled that, two large explosions were reportedly heard towards Maiduguri airport direction, which caused panic in the city. It was later learnt that, the military moved out to stop the invading terrorists, and the Army has since explained that they were successful as many terrorists were neutralized in an ambush staged by Operation Lafiya Dole.

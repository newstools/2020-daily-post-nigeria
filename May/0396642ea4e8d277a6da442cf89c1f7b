President Muhammadu Buhari has charged Nigerian Governors to work closely with the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, to engender better harmony in the daunting task of checking the pandemic. The President spoke during an online meeting Monday with the Governors’ Forum, disclosing that the PTF had briefed him on steps in the national response to the pandemic. President Buhari said the pandemic was “beyond technology, power, and resources,” noting that countries that had all those, were recording the highest casualties round the world. “We have to be very careful. We need to continue to educate and persuade the people to accept the reality of the situation, and do all that is necessary to stay safe,” the President said. The meeting also discussed economic and security issues, among others, with the Governors commending the President on the “leadership and direction” he has given the country in combating COVID-19.

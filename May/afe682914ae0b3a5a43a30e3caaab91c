A businesswoman, Hassana Shuaibu, has appealed to a Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court to dissolve her marriage to Shuaibu Abdullahi. Her reasons are his alleged drunkenness and refusal to pray, NAN reports. The applicant reminded the court that in 2018, she sought dissolution of her marriage in court on the same grounds. Shuaibu recalled that Abdullahi entered an undertaking then, with a promise to change his attitude. “My husband still drinks beer and refuses to perform the five times obligatory Islamic prayers. He has also refused to observe the Muslim fast. I pray the court to dissolve my marriage on grounds of his drunkenness, refusal to fast and dislike,” she said. The woman further told the court that she got married to Abdullahi over 30 years ago and both have six children. Speaking, Abdullahi pleaded guilty and begged the court to give him time to settle with his wife. The Judge, Muhammad Adamu ordered them to settle based on Abdullahi’s admission. He warned that the marriage would be dissolved if settlement fails. Adamu adjourned the matter until May 27.

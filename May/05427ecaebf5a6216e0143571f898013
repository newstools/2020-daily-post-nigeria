The Abia State Government has frowned at the activities of school proprietors, which it alleged are secretly reopening and running their private schools despite government’s directive on closure of schools, as part of preventive measures to contain spreads of COVID-19 disease. Kennedy Nwangwa, the State Commissioner for Education, who made this known in a statement in Umuahia, on Thursday, emphasized that COVID-19 disease is real as no one should elevate his or her personal gain above the life and well-being of the Abia child. The Commissioner revealed that the State Government initiated a Radio/TV Classroom Program to cater for the interest of all our children while they are at home as a result of the restrictions necessitated by the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. He explained, “This program has been running seamlessly and has even diversified to having online versions for those who may not find the time for the radio or TV programs favourable especially the parents/guardians who might also need to guide and supervise their children/wards. “Everyone is expected to take advantage of this platform and ensure our children learn conveniently at home in this trying time without constituting a risk to either themselves or to others instead of secretly running school activities that completely negate the basic expectation of protecting the Abia child against the ravaging coronavirus”. It continued, “Consequently, all those operating any form of physical school activities for pupils and students are hereby strongly advised to desist from carrying on with such activities immediately. Anyone caught in these practice after this announcement will face the full weight of the consequences of their action even up to closing down such schools permanently and also blacklisting the Proprietor”. “We hereby appeal once again for everyone’s understanding and ask that we should all join hands to do the right thing,” the Abia Government added. The State Government however assured the public that it would announced when it is right to reopen schools, pointing out that all Schools would remain closed in the interest of all citizens and residents of the state.

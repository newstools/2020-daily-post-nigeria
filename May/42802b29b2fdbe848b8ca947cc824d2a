Liverpool centre-back, Virgil van Dijk, has disclosed that he considered a string of factors when he decided to join the Reds and snubbed interest from elsewhere, including Manchester City. The Holland international joined Liverpool from Southampton for £75million in 2017. Speaking on why he decided not to move to Man City despite interest from the Citizens, the 28-year-old told BT Sport: “Before I decided to choose Liverpool, I looked at all the aspects of the clubs; the way of playing, the team-mates, the future as well. “The city, the fans, everything has got to be a big part of joining a club. “I think Liverpool at that time when I made the decision was the right decision and obviously to reach the Champions League final in my first six months was a big bonus and helped me a lot in my development. “With a Champions League medal from last season and a Premier League medal on the way, if this season is completed, Van Dijk is sure he made the right choice.” Van Dijk added: “To be honest, in the first six months that I joined, we had more training sessions.” “It was intense, and there were a lot of different things that were going to be asked of me. “And I enjoyed it a lot – the hard work, the discussions that I had with individual players about the way Liverpool play. “The manager, Jurgen Klopp, demands a lot from me, and that helped me become the player I am today.” Ballon d'Or: Piers Morgan clashes with Van Dijk over comment on Ronaldo EPL: Why Fabinho snubbed Man City, PSG, Man Utd for Liverpool Ballon D’Or: Danny Murphy reveals player that should win award

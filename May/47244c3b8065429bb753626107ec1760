The Ogun State Government has started taking punitive measures against residents violating its directives to curtail the spread of coronavirus pandemic in the state. This is as the state, through the aid of security agents, arrested and prosecuted 102 persons for violating the Coronavirus directives of government. It will be recalled that Gov Dapo Abiodun on Friday extended the lockdown in the state for another week. This, he said, was because some people were flouting the orders laid down by government to stop the community spread of Coronavirus. In a chat with DAILY POST on Wednesday, the spokesman of Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps, Babatunde Akinbiyi, said the 102 arrested persons were arraigned before a mobile court at Ibara under bridge, Abeokuta. According to Akinbiyi, they were arrested for disobeying the stay-at-home order of government, for refusing to wear face masks and for not observing social/physical distancing. Some of them, it was learnt, were okada riders, taxi drivers, traders as well as wanderers found on the streets during the lockdown. Speaking further, Akinbiyi disclosed that 40 offenders were made to pay fines ranging between N500 and N2, 000; 46 engaged in community services for a period of four hours, while 16 were set free for pleading not guilty for genuine reasons. DAILY POST gathered that the operation was jointly carried out by the police, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps, the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS), the judiciary and other security agencies. Ogun State has 127 confirmed cases of Coronavirus; 48 have been discharged, while 5 have passed away.

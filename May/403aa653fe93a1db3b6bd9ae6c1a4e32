The Adamawa State Government says two fresh COVID-19 cases have been identified in the state. Secretary to the Adamawa State Government, Bashir Ahmed, who is also the State Chairman of COVID-19 Containment Committee, announced Friday that the two were from eleven samples sent from the state for testing, with two results pending. He added that the two exist separately and had no link with the older two cases in the state. The COVID-19 Containment Committee chairman made the pronouncements during a press briefing in the Situation Room, State Secretariat, Yola, explaining that the two new cases are one from Hildi, in Hong local government area and the other, a female, is in Saminaka, a community in Yola South local government area. He appealed to the people of the state to ensure social distancing and observe other safety rules to assist the government in containing the COVID-19. It may be recalled that while the index case is a journalist based in the state capital, Yola (Yola North LGA), the second case is a doctor based in Mubi, Adamawaâ€™s second largest and most prominent town. With the two new cases being from Hong and Yola South LGAs respectively, it means the four cases are from different LGAs in the state.

Several houses have been razed and hundreds of residents displaced following a clash between two communities in Lamurde Local Government Area of Adamawa State. The conflict was said to have ensued between Hausa and Choba communities in Tingno, Lamurde. The Chairman of Lamurde Local Government Area, Mr. Burto Pwadyangakai William, said Friday that the crisis started Thursday evening over an argument among youths of the communities.

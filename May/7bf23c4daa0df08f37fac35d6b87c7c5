Eight people were on Wednesday killed in a fresh attack by suspected bandits in Gonan Rogo, Kufana District, Kajuru Local Government area of Kaduna State. DAILYPOST recalls that 17 people were killed on Tuesday while several houses and property worth thousands of naira was destroyed. Wednesday’s attack took place in three villages, Bakin- Kogi, Idanu and Makyali linking Gonan Rogo in Kufana District. It was reliably gathered that after Tuesday’s attack, wives and children from the three villages ran for safety, took shelter in a nearby Idon community while the men stayed behind in case of further attack. But, they were all taken unaware when the bandits stormed the area early Wednesday morning. Confirming the latest killings, President of the Adara Development Association (ADA), Mr. Awema Maisamari, said the attackers stormed the village shooting sporadically and killed seven instantly, while one person was found dead in a nearby bush. According to him, the gunmen attacked Bakin- Kogi, Idanu and Makyali communities. Mr. Awema Maisamari said two other persons were seriously injured and were taken to a nearby hospital. Kaduna State Police Command’s PPRO, ASP Mohammed Jalige did not respond to calls put across to him for confirmation.

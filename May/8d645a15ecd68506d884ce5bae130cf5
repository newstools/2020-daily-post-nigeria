Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has named former Portsmouth star, Papa Bouba Diop, and former Arsenal star, Patrick Vieira, as the two players he hated playing against during his career. According to Scholes, both Diop and Vieira were so ‘awkward’ to deal with. “As a midfield player, especially the way I played, I did not really have to beat people, I did not have to be stronger than the other person, I did not have to be quicker than the other person, it was more my passing that beat them,” Scholes told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I suppose the awkward ones, obviously Patrick Vieira, he is so long and so big. You think you have got the ball, next minute he nicks the ball over your head. “He was a clever player as well, he could play one-twos around you, he could score goals, he could make goals. “There’s one more that people won’t think of when I played against Portsmouth, do you remember Papa Bouba Diop? He played for Fulham as well. “Big, massive, they used to call him the wardrobe. Get involved with him physically, and you are absolutely wasting your time. “I always found him awkward to play against. Look, he was not a Patrick Vieira, of course, he was not, but he still had talent. As far as players being awkward to play against, I always found him a nuisance.” Scholes won eleven Premier League titles, two UEFA Champions League trophies, and other silverware during his 20-year career at Man United under former Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson.

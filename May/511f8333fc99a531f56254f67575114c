It cannot be confirmed if ransom was paid before he was rescued from his abductors. Recall that on May 17, 2020, Lt Commander Ajare Uchegbulah Amadi was abducted along Ose/Oba Akoko, Akoko North East Local Government in the Northern Senatorial District of the state. He was said to be travelling to Abuja when the gunmen emerged from the bush and waylaid his vehicle with the demand of N50 million ransom. Confirming the release of the Senior Naval Officer, the Police Public Relations Officer, Ondo State Command, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro said that his “release was sequel to the aggressive manhunt placed on his abductors.” Ikoro added that the state Commissioner of Police, Undie Adie has “warned travelers within this period to strictly adhere to the travel ban on inter State movement imposed by the Federal government as a means to curtail the spread of COVID19, as these bad boys are using the advantage of the empty roads to advance their nefarious acts.” Gunmen kidnap Senior Naval Officer in Ondo Kidnapped Immigration officer recounts ordeal in hands of Militants Gunmen kidnap Ondo monarch's wife, two children, driver

Slovenian government has declared an end to the coronavirus pandemic. Prime Minister, Janez Jansa told parliament on Thursday after authorities confirmed less than seven new coronavirus cases in Slovenia each day for the past two weeks.

However, the government declared that people coming from non-EU states will go into mandatory 14-days quarantine except for some exemptions including diplomats and people transporting cargo. Also, foreign citizens who show signs of coronavirus infection will not be allowed to enter the country. The Prime minister said: “Since the danger of spreading the COVID-19 virus remains, some general and special measures like public gatherings remain banned. “People now arriving in Slovenia from other European Union states will no longer go into mandatory quarantine but those from no EU states will quarantine of at least 14 days. “As for foreign citizens who show signs of coronavirus infection, they will not be allowed to enter the country.” It also declared that football and all other team competitions could resume from May 23. “Citizens will still have to follow basic rules to prevent a possible spread of infection like wear masks in indoor public spaces, stand at least 1.5 metres (5 feet) apart, and disinfect hands upon entering public spaces. “Slovenia has tamed the epidemic over the past two months.Today, Slovenia has the best epidemiological picture in Europe,” he added. The prime minister added that the end of the epidemic means some measures, including financial aid to citizens and firms hit by the coronavirus, will expire at the end of May. The country of two million people had since the outbreak of coronavirus reported 1,464 cases and 103 deaths.

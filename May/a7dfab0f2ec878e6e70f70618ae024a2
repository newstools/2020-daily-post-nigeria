The Imo state House of Assembly Tuesday said that the factual findings on the alleged misappropriation of the local government funds under Emeka Ihedioha’s administration would soon be sent to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for immediate action. Chiagozie Nwaneri, the Chairman of the Assembly Public Accounts Committee disclosed this on Tuesday while speaking with newsmen immediately after plenary. He said that the committee has done 50 percent of its job, revealing that findings so far have been convincing. The member representing Oru-East state constituency further disclosed that the House had earlier involved the services of external auditor and an accountant to conclude the report as submitted to the Assembly by the Auditor-General of local government in the state. “The Public Accounts Committee, as you know started with the immediate past government and has existed for almost a year. It is unbiased and void of witch-hunt.” “But the present government came on board, it has not been reshuffled. It has remained the same. Although, we are also doing some findings to ascertain if the Auditor-General is not using it to witch-hunt anybody.” “As soon as we have obtained substantial evidence, we will hand the matter over to the EFCC to take charge.” The former Majority Leader alongside members of the committee maintained that due process was being followed and no one, according to him, is witch-hunting anyone. Meanwhile, DAILY POST learnt that the immediate past Governor, Emeka Ihedioha’s earlier appeal to the court to stop the Assembly from probing his government, hit the brick walls.

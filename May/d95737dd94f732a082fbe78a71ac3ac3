Former England manager, Sven-Goran Erikson, has revealed that he rejected the chance to become the Super Eagles coach at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Erikson stated this in an interview with Branschen.se. According to him, he turned down the offer after he was told by a Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) official, that his salary would be paid into two different bank accounts. The NFF contacted Erikson after the late Shaibu Amodu was dismissed after the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The Federation also spoke with Guus Hiddink, Glenn Hoddle, Arigo Sacchi, Giovanni Trapattoni, Eriksson and Louis van Gaal. “I was called into the room with a chairman who declared that they wanted me as a coach but with the proviso that my salary would be divided into two parts: one that I got into my account and another that would be deposited into another account that was not in my name. “There I refused, I thought something didn’t go right. I’ve never applied for a job in my entire life. “All my assignments have come about through the results I have achieved. I have never gone through any traditional job interviews, never sat down and conducted any tests or been analysed,” Erikson said. NFF eventually gave the job to Lars Lagerback at that time.

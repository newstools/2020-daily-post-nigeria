The World Health Organisation (WHO), says the agency will work with relevant organisations to identify the animal source of coronavirus. They are the World Organisation for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Tedros Ghebreyesus, the Director-General, made this known via the WHO Twitter account. Ghebreyesus disclosed that he reconvened the Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations to review the pandemic. “We accept the committee’s advice that WHO works to identify the animal source of the virus through international scientific and collaborative missions. “We will continue supporting countries to sustain essential health services…(and) with technical and logistical support, especially those that need it most,” he said.

The Lagos State Government has predicted a sharp decline in the cases of COVID-19 by November this year. The Commissioner for Health in the state, Prof. Akin Abayomi, stated this during the Ministerial Press Briefing to commemorate Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu’s one year in office. “It is difficult to predict when the pandemic will end in Nigeria because this depends on a lot of factors. “But in the next four to six months (between September and November), we will see a sharp decline in the number of cases in the country, and this will signal that we are coming towards defeating the outbreak,” Abayomi said. According to him, Lagos State was likely to reach between 90,000 to 120,000 cases of coronavirus. Abayomi, however, insisted these figures do not signify a peak period for the state. There are currently 3,756 confirmed cases in Lagos.

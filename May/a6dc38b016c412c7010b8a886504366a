Chelsea forward, Willian, has said he might have to leave the club, as they are refusing to offer him a new three-year deal, the UK Mirror reports. Willian is out of contract this summer and will become a free agent at the end of June. With the Premier League season set to run at least into July, the Brazilian is prepared to pen a short-term extension, so he can see out the remainder of the campaign at Stamford Bridge. However, the 31-year-old has admitted his career beyond that remains uncertain, as Chelsea have only offered him a two-year extension. “It’s a difficult situation. Chelsea offered me two years and they are not going to change. “I don’t know if it will be possible to stay. My goal is to continue working and focus on the remainder of the season, so that Chelsea can continue winning games. “I have a clear head and I’m focused for the rest of the season that we have left. Let’s see what happens,” Willian said.

The Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State has suspended eight members of the party for constituting a factional state’s Caretaker Committee. The Committee’s head of media, Mr. John Akans, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday. According to Akans, the decision to suspend the erring members was taken at an emergency meeting on Friday evening. The statement reads in part: “The Working Committee, an arm of the Plateau Caretaker Committee at its emergency meeting on Friday evening at the party’s secretariat, reviewed the unfortunate incident that took place at the secretariat. “Some group of rascals mischievously constituted themselves into a caretaker committee, which is an affront to the national leadership of our party, under the leadership of Prince Uche Secondus. “The state leadership of the party frowned at these decedents and therefore approved their immediate suspension from PDP. “Seven of the affected people are Nandom Penap Exodus, Godwin W. Bedir, Akims Mamot, Mrs. Asabe Dareng, Nathaniel Dakas, Jacob Dashe, and Alhaji Kabiru Musa.” Plateau PDP crisis deepens as two parallel Excos emerge Paul Agbo: Aftermath of PDP congresses - Is the storm over Agabus Pwanabeshi: Is Plateau PDP going into oblivion

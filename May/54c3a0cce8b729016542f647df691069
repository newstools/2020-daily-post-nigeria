The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has reacted to the Supreme Court’s nullification of the conviction of a former governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu. Also nullified was the judgement against his firm, Slok Nigeria Limited and Jones Udeogu, a former Director of Finance and Account of Abia State Government. The apex court ordered their fresh trial at the lower court. Dele Oyewale, EFCC Head, Media & Publicity, in a statement noted that the court based its verdict on the grounds that Justice Mohammed Idris, who convicted Kalu and others had been elevated to the Court of Appeal before the judgment and returned to the lower court to deliver the judgement which it considered illegal. EFCC said it considers the judgement of the apex court as quite unfortunate. The agency called it a technical ambush against the trial of the former governor. The Commission declared preparedness for a fresh and immediate retrial. The spokesman said that EFCC’s evidences against Kalu and others were overwhelming. “The corruption charges against Kalu still subsist because the Supreme Court did not acquit him of them. “The entire prosecutorial machinery of the EFCC would be launched in a fresh trial where justice is bound to be served in due course”, Oyewale added Orji Kalu: Buhari, Magu, Justice Bulkachuwa under fire over lawmaker's conviction, sealing of The Sun by EFCC Orji Kalu: Adegboruwa reacts to Supreme Court Judgement, reveals consequences Gov.

The Northern Governors’ Forum (NGF) has sent their condolences to the people and government of Kano State and the Council of Traditional rulers and Chiefs, over the death of Emir of Rano, Alhaji Tafida Abubakar Ila Auta Bawo. Governor Simon Lalong, who is the Chairman of the forum, in a statement, described the death of the monarch as shocking and painful. “We mourn the passing of the royal father, whose words of wisdom, and pursuit for peace and tolerance stood him out and endeared him to his subjects and people outside his domain. “His death surely creates a huge vacuum as it came at a time when Kano State and his subjects needed him most for the fight against COVID-19, which is a major challenge confronting the state and the nation,” Lalong said. The Emir of Rano died on Saturday at the Nassarawa Specialist Hospital. He reportedly died around 4:45pm after a brief illness. It is, however, uncertain if the Emir’s illness is related or not to COVID-19.

The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) has condemned the decision taken by the President Muhammadu Buhari’s government, relaxing the Coronavirus lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States. The medical body described the decision as premature, adding that it can potentially expose more Nigerians to the deadly COVID-19. The doctors warned that Nigeria could experience a surge in the number of Coronavirus cases. NMA noted that at the moment health workers are grappling with numerous challenges such as lack for bed spaces in epicenters of the pandemic, especially Lagos, yet to be ascertained cause(s) of mass deaths in Kano State and delay in the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE) to public and private hospitals, among others. President Buhari on Monday announced that by Monday, May 4, the lockdown will be relaxed in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun. But the NMA, in a statement in Abuja, signed by its President, Dr. Francis Faduyile, said, “As the incidence of the COVID-19 hits the 2000th mark by this weekend, just seven days after hitting the 1000th mark, it figuratively tilts the epidemiological curve towards an upward spike,” the statement said. “More so, the revelation by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) that the nation lacks bed spaces in Lagos worsens this frightening scenario. “The confusing situation in Kano is neither unraveled nor resolved. At the same time, some states continue to live in the delusion of zero COVID-19 incidences. “The easing of the lockdown even in phases is very premature. Nigeria should learn from her neighbour, Ghana where the same action produced 100 per cent increase in infection rate in just a week.”

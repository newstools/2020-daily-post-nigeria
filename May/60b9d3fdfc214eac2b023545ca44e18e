Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has admitted that life and football will never be the same again, following the COVID-19 outbreak. The pandemic has claimed almost 400,000 lives across the world. It also led to several leagues being suspended. However, Spain’s La Liga, England’s Premier League and Italy’s Serie A are all set to restart in June. “I don’t think football will ever be the same,” Messi said in an interview El Pais on Sunday. “But beyond football, I don’t think life, in general, will ever be the same, either. “In my case, it’s with a feeling of sorrow and frustration for those that have suffered the most due to the loss of loved ones.” Messi has donated more than €1million to hospitals and charities fighting COVID-19.

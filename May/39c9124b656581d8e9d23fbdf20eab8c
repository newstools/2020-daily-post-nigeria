Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has picked three club legends he would have loved to line up alongside. The 30-year-old, who is on loan at Old Trafford, made his selections from the squad that won the Treble in the 1998/1999 season. A boyhood United fan, Ighalo was a child when Sir Alex Ferguson’s side lifted the FA Cup, Premier League and Champions League. “If you have Ryan Giggs from the left, David Beckham from the right and Paul Scholes in the middle, then what else does a striker need? “When you see Beckham cross the ball, all you have to do is move your leg or your head and tap it in,” Ighalo told United’s official website. The Treble-winning squad also included current United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who brought Ighalo in from Shanghai Shenhua in the January window.

FIFA is set to probe Bruno Fernandes’ move to Manchester United, which is now at the heart of a transfer dispute. Sampdoria claims they are owed £4million, following his January switch to Old Trafford. The Serie A side has now sent their complaint to the world football’s governing body. Sampdoria sold Fernandes to Sporting Lisbon in 2017 in a £7.5million deal and they claim they should be paid 10% of any future profit made on the Portugal midfielder, owing to terms of that deal. Fernandes was sold to United in January for an initial fee of £47million rising to a potential £67m. However, the Serie A side is yet to receive what they believe is their cut. Fernandes unilaterally rescinded his contract one year after moving the Lisbon, after Sporting players were attacked at the club’s training ground by their own fans. But he re-signed with Sporting, who believe that he was duly signed a second time as a free agent, thus meaning they do not owe the Serie A side a cut.

The Premier League’s chief executive, Richard Masters, has said he is “as confident as we can be” about restarting in June. England’s top flight was suspended on March 13 amid the coronavirus crisis. June 12 has been pencilled in as a possible date to restart, with players returning to training in small groups this week. Masters, speaking to BBC Sport, said that the Premier League remains flexible on the date of resumption. “We wouldn’t have taken the first step to get back to training if we weren’t convinced we had created a very safe environment for our players. “It is the first step and we have to be sure when we go to contact training we have completed those processes,” he said.

British health officials, on Monday, added loss of taste and smell to their COVID-19 symptoms list. This follows warnings from experts, who claimed Coronavirus cases were being missed. “From today, all individuals should self-isolate if they develop a new continuous cough or fever or anosmia. “Anosmia is the loss or a change in your normal sense of smell. It can also affect your sense of taste as the two are closely linked,” Britain’s chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said in a statement. Van-Tam also advised anyone who notices a distinct change in their sense of taste or smell, to self-isolate for seven days. The symptoms will now join fever and cough as main indicators of the virus, with Van-Tam saying it would mean a 2% rise in picking up cases.

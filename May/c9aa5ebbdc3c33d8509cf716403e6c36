The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has told Nigerians not to expect to see the Coronavirus test results of the Dubai, UK and US returnees. The agency said it does not make such information public, adding that the results will be shared only with the returnees. NCDC Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu stated this during the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 Thursday’s press briefing in Abuja. The Director-General further disclosed that the returnees are still undergoing the stipulated 14days of self-isolation. “We are doing the test, even when the tests are out we are not going to offer it to you. We will offer it to the returnees. If they are patients we will manage that. “We are not going to make public the results whether you just came back from Dubai or you are living in Nigeria. Results are meant for patients who got tested,” he said. DAILY POST reported that no fewer than 253 Nigerians were recently evacuated from the UK by the Federal Government and 265 others evacuated from Dubai, amid the Coronavirus outbreak. Some more Nigerians also returned from the United States as countries continue to evacuate their citizens, following the Coronavirus outbreak.

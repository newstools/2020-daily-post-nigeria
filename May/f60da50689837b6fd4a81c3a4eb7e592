WHO also affirmed that traditional, complementary and alternative medicine had many benefits. “Africa has a long history of traditional medicine and practitioners that play an important role in providing care to populations. “Medicinal plants such as Artemisia annua are being considered as possible treatments for COVID-19 and should be tested for efficacy and adverse side effects. “Africans deserve to use medicines tested to the same standard. “Even if therapies are derived from traditional practice and natural, establishing their efficacy and safety through rigorous clinical trials are critical,’’ it stated.

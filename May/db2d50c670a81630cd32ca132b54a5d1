Ekiti Governor, Kayode Fayemi, has approved the appointment of members of the Governing Board of the Ekiti Security Network Agency. He appointed Akin Aregbesola as the chairman. The agency is popularly known as ‘Amotekun Corps’. Chief Press to the Governor, Yinka Oyebode, in a statement on Sunday, said the appointment was to ensure effective take-off and efficient management of Amotekun. Special Adviser on Security Matters, Brig. Gen. Joe Komolafe (rtd), will serve as the Corps Commander. Members of the board are Dr BJ Akin-Obasola, Mr Joel Idowu Ajayi and Major Fatai Fakorede. The governor also appointed Justice Cornelius Akintayo (rtd) as Chairman of what is to be known as Independent Amotekun Complaints Board. All appointments take immediate effect. The Ekiti State House of Assembly passed the Amotekun bill in February. In March, Fayemi signed it into law with a warning to criminals to stay away from the state. He said Amotekun corps, in collaboration with similar security agencies in other South-West states would assist existing agencies in gathering information about crime, arrest and prosecution of suspects.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has admitted that COVID-19 may never go away, Reuters reports. WHO’s executive director emergencies program, Mike Ryan, on Wednesday said the coronavirus may just become one of the viruses around the world that kill people annually. “This virus just may become another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away. HIV hasn’t gone away. “I’m not comparing the two diseases but I think it is important that we’re realistic. I don’t think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear,” Ryan said. HIV/AIDS was first clinically observed in 1981 in the United States and after 30 years, no vaccine has been found. Over 4.31million cases of Coronavirus have been reported around the world, with over 294,000 deaths already recorded.

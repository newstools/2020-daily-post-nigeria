The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, on Friday, told residents to return any food item unfit for consumption distributed to them as palliative. Aliyu said this when she inspected the palliatives for Kabusa, Garki, Wuse and City Centre wards in the Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) in Abuja. She advised the residents to report to the authorities whenever they were given palliative items below the required standard. “If you find any food unfit for consumption, you are at liberty to notify the chairman (of the council area) and such material will be replaced at the expense of the supplier,” she said. According to her, the supplies shared were gotten from different channels that could be prone to a production error, NAN reports. “These materials were brought together by several suppliers, but as in every production process, you cannot guarantee that each of them will be problem-free,” the minister added.

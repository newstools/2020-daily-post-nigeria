The Cross River State Government has established seven mobile courts to try nose mask offenders/violators in the state. The Commissioner of Health, who is the Chairman of COVID-19 Task Force, Dr Betta Edu, disclosed this to DAILY POST via phone in Calabar on Tuesday. Edu lamented that people who knew the points where the enforcement agents located played fast one by wearing the mask before them and remove it shortly after leaving the place. The Commissioner said that six of the monitoring team and the mobile courts will be in Calabar while one each would be at urban development areas of the state.
She said, “The mobile courts will try any nose mask violators and sentence offender in accordance with the approved laws. “The people have been avoiding the points where these task force members are situated, what we do now is to have complete mobile task force with mobile courts where they can situate anywhere and try offenders of nose mask violators. “They are starting operation tomorrow morning (Wednesday).”

Reports had it that about 70 people were killed by the bandits who invaded five communities in Sabin Birni Local Government Area of the State during the Eid-Fitr celebrations.

The President commiserated with families whose loved ones were killed by the bandits. He also prayed that those who sustained injuries during the attack recover quickly. Buhari lamented that the attack was coming at a time Nigeria was battling to curb the spread of Coronavirus, describing it as unfortunate and tragic. He said: “As the world and Nigeria battle Coronavirus pandemic, it is tragic and unfortunate that bandits have remained active in parts of the country, killing innocent people and throwing families into despair. “We will not abandon you to your fate because we are determined to bring these mass murderers to their knees and crush them totally.’’ The President stated that a major military operation code named “Operation Accord” was launched by the military, and was aimed at flushing out bandits and criminal elements attacking the North-West and North Central states. “This operation will be a full time and sustained military offensive that is intended to deny the bandits any breathing space to reorganize and regroup,’’ he said.

Inter Milan have made it clear they are not ready to pay £10.75million for Victor Moses, the UK Sun reports. The former Nigeria international is owned by Chelsea and Inter have informed the Premier League side they value him at £6m. The Serie A club believe the financial impact of the COVID-19, means there is no plenty of money to spend this summer. Moses currently has one year left on his Chelsea deal. Inter coach, Antonio Conte, has proposed that the winger should be loaned again for whole of the 2020/2021 season, but the Blues are unlikely to agree to that. Moses has been loaned out to five different clubs since joining Chelsea in 2012 including Liverpool, Stoke City, West Ham, Fenerbahce and Inter.

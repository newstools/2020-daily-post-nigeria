The Edo State Coordinator of the National Youth Service Corps, Mr. Clement Ojo, has tasked Corps members posted to the state to be patriotic and neutral in the forthcoming governorship election in the state. He made the call while marking the 47th anniversary of the scheme in Benin City, Edo State. “We will continue to advise our Corps members to be patriotic particularly, as it is an election year now and our Corps members will be part of the election that is coming and so, we will expect them to remain patriotic and be very careful. “Then we expect them to always be security conscious”, he advised. Ojo said the scheme since its inception has enjoyed a very cordial relationship with the state government which can easily be seen in the way and manner it has benefited immensely from the government. “Well, the relationship with the NYSC in this state has been very cordial, in the sense we have a permanent camp. “It is because as we speak now, development, building work is ongoing at the Permanent Orientation Camp. “And in fact, and I am very sure, judging by the level of work at that particular place now that any orientation now, we can occupy the place. “It is not only this, the state government, because of the relationship with us, any time we go to orientation camp, we see Comrade buses, one to each local government to move our Corps members from the camp straight to the local government they are posted. It is because of our good rapport. “Not only this, we have a 150KVA generating set that was given to us to be used at the camp that is being built now”, he said.

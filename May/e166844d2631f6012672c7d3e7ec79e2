The Yobe State branch of the Nigeria Labor Congress, (NLC) has tasked the state government on the need to fully implement the N30,000 minimum wage as soon as revenue of the state improves. Comrade Muktar Musa Tarbutu, State Chairman of the NLC forwarded the demand at this year’s Workers’ Day held in Damaturu under a low key atmosphere. He said the NLC is aware of the general fall in allocation from the federal government across the country, coupled with competing demands over the implementation of government’s policies and programs, hence the need to fully implement the new minimum wage as soon as the revenue of the state improves. “As the NLC celebrates the event in a low keyed and lighter note, it wishes to once again commend the Yobe state government over the prompt payment of workers’ salaries and other legitimate entitlements with a view to cushioning the effect of the measures put in place to curtail the spread of COVID-19 despite the lean financial resources accruing to the state government from the federation account. “Thus, workers from all sectors of public and private organizations are advised to celebrate the occasion from home, while adhering strictly to the safety measures against COVID-19 outlined by the state committee on the prevention and control of the COVID-19 disease”, Tarbutu urged. The Chairman also appealed to workers in the state to continue praying to God to help eliminate the dreaded Coronavirus pandemic. “The NLC appreciates the Yobe community for abiding by all calls by the Yobe state government to imbibe all necessary preventive measures against contracting the disease”, he said. Highlights of the this year’s Workers’ Day celebration in Yobe state was the distribution of hand sanitizers, face masks, tap buckets and liquid soaps to the State Specialists Hospital, Motor parks and Governor’s Office in Damaturu by the NLC as part of its contribution in the fight against COVID-19.

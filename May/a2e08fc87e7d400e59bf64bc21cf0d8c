The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, has disclosed that 22,000 Nigerians have been tested for coronavirus. NCDC Director General, Chikwe Ihekweazu made the disclosure during the daily press briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, on Thursday. The NCDC DG said the body only made public the number of persons tested and not the number of tests conducted. Ihekweazue said those infected are made to undergo a series of tests which are not counted and updated into the system. He said: “The data shared is on people tested not on tests done. The data we share when we say we have about 22,0000 tested, those are on people tested, we don’t include all the series of tests. “Every individual that is positive will have to be tested every three, four or five days. And some would have stayed in the hospital for about four weeks, so all those are tests being done as well and all of that are in the lab. “So, the numbers are really not fully representing the works being done in the labs across the country. We are not reflecting those numbers in the numbers we share everyday.” Coronavirus: 7,000 Nigerians tested for COVID-19 - NCDC Coronavirus: NCDC hints on testing 4,000 Nigerians daily NCDC tests 7,153 Nigerians for COVID-19

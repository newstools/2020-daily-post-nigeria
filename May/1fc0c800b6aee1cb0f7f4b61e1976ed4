Nollywood actor, Zubby Michael has lambasted popular Singer, Tunde Ednut for saying controversial Prophet, Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere is his pastor. Michael on his Instagram page also blasted Nigerians for claiming that he got spiritual powers for his Nollywood success from Odumeje. The 35-year old claimed that the clergyman was only his friend adding that during his housewarming party Odumeje sprayed him over N1 million in cash while he reciprocated the gesture by giving N500,000 during his birthday party. “The lion, Odumeje. Where is he leading you all? You guys can enjoy all the drama but I hate it when you say, ‘that’s where Zubby got powers from, he made Zubby successful’,” Zubby explained. “Are you sick? The thunder that will fire those making such claims will come from Adamawa! I’m not denying he’s my friend way back from Onitsha. But does that mean I go there to pray? The actor added that he doesn’t go to church but he is a spiritual person. “I hate it when you tag me in your unnecessary drama. Especially Tunde Ednut. Are you stupid? Why are you promoting unnecessary drama? Don’t you see what others promote? You’re a fool. I’m saying this because of my fans.” See Video:   #ZubbyMichael blasts #Tundeednut , explains his relationship with #Anambra Prophet, #Odumeje #Indaboski A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on May 10, 2020 at 9:38am PDT  Nollywood actor, Zubby Micheal gets political appointment Imo: We know who gave you hints - Pastor Giwa attacks Mbaka over Hope Uzodinma prophecy Popular Nollywood actor, 'Wanke Wanke' is dead

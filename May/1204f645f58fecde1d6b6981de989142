The Kano State government has said President Muhammadu Buhari gave consent to ease the lockdown imposed due to coronavirus. The State Ministry of Health made this known on its Twitter page on Saturday. Recall that reports emerged online that Governor Ganduje came under attack for relaxing the lockdown order in the state despite a record of 92 new cases. The Governor had announced that Mondays and Thursdays would be lockdown free days, especially between 10 am and 4pm to enable residents shop for food. But following backlash from Nigerians the State Ministry of Health tweeted,”@KanostateNg relaxes #lockdown on Mondays & Thursdays from 10:00am – 4:00pm with the consent of the President @MBuhari. “The General public is to adhere strictly to #COVID19Kano protocols as given by the health professionals.”

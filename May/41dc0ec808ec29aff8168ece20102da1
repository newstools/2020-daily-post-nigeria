Borussia Dortmund star, Emre Can, has advised his teammate, Jadon Sancho, not to leave the club amid interest from Manchester United. DAILY POST had reported that Sancho had drawn the interest of Man United in the past few weeks. Man United are willing to offer the 20-year-old the no.7 shirt in a bid to lure him to join the Old Trafford club this summer. The Red Devils are believed to be leading the race to sign the England international from Dortmund ahead of Liverpool and Chelsea for a club-record fee. But Can wants Sancho to reject a big-money move this summer and continue his career at Dortmund. “I see no reason to put Manchester United above Borussia Dortmund,” the Germany international told Sport Bild. “Not from a sporting side and not because of the appeal. I would tell Jadon Sancho to stay put and let play together forever. “Jad has a class that not a lot of players possess. I noticed that fairly quickly. “He’s enormously important for us.” EPL: Marco Reus advises Sancho against leaving Dortmund EPL: Marcus Rashford welcomes Sancho to Man Utd EPL: Berbatov gives reason Jadon Sancho wouldn't think twice to join Man Utd

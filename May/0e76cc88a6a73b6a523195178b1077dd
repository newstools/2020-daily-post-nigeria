The Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 has reacted to the rowdy scenes around banks and other financial institutions today, the first day of the easing of the lockdown in Lagos, FCT and Ogun. Normal activities resumed in the three states after five weeks of staying at home. However, pictures and videos that went viral on social media, showed that citizens flouted social distancing rules as they fought on queues and tried to force their way into the business premises. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, warned that the danger of coronavirus infection is not over. Mustapha stated while speaking at the daily briefing of the Taskforce on Monday. “The PTF has been monitoring the level of compliance with some of the measures and early observations showed lack of compliance with social distancing and wearing of masks. “We note particularly the chaotic scenes around the banks and other financial institutions. “We urge citizens to minimize the risk of getting infected while trying to transact in the banks. We similarly urge the banks to ensure that their ATMs and online banking systems are in good order and stocked regularly to avoid convergence of customers in their premises,” he said.

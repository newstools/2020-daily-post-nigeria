The Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 has urged Nigerians to sit at home, except they have “compelling reasons to go out”. This comes amid the chaotic scenes around Lagos, Abuja and Ogun States, as the lockdown was eased from Monday. The three states have been in total lockdown for the past five weeks, as the federal government sought to curb the spread of Coronavirus. However, Boss Mustapha, who is the Chairman of PTF, has urged citizens to play their part to help the government. “Let me remind you, once more, that this easing up is in phases and those who are permitted to open have clearly been defined. “Our admonition to Nigerians is that it is still desirable to stay at home if there is no compelling reason to go out and to comply with the measures always, whether at home or not,” Mustapha said during Monday’s daily briefing. Mustapha also expressed worry over the deportation of Almajiris from one state to the other. He said the taskforce would engage state governors to put a stop on it for now. “There has been very noticeable relocation of Almajiris from one state to another, up until yesterday. With the ban on interstate movement, the continuation of this exercise will not be in alignment with the guidelines issued. The PTF shall engage with the respective State Governments on how to achieve their objectives,” Mustapha added.

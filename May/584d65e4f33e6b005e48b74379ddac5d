The Presidency has announced that Nigerian returnees will no longer pay the cost of quarantine accommodation and feeding upon arrival in Nigeria. Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama said this on Monday. He disclosed that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC and Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN have agreed to foot the bills of the returnees stranded as a result of Coronavirus pandemic. The Special Assistant to the President on New Media, Bashir Ahmad announced this on his Twitter page. The tweet read: “The NNPC and CBN have agreed to fund, as part of their CSR, the cost of quarantine accommodation and feeding for all Nigerians returning to the country from abroad, the Foreign Affairs’ Minister, Geoffrey Onyeama has disclosed.” DAILY POST recalls that the government in a revised guideline demanded that returnees pay for their two weeks’ stay at the isolation centers. Before Friday, the returnees were only required to pay for their flight back home while their accommodation at the isolation centers was sorted out by the government. But in the letter by the Embassy of Nigeria in Bangkok, Thailand, which was signed by the Head of Chancery, Nicholas P. Uhomoibhi, and dated May 14, each returnee is to pay N297,600 for quarantine and feeding in Nigeria.

Former Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has backed Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, as the natural successor of Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, and Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo for the Ballon d’Or. Messi and Ronaldo are two of the best players in the history of the game and have won eleven of the last 12 Ballon d’Or awards. But Emery, who coached Neymar before he left PSG for Arsenal, believes the Brazilian international can take over from Messi and Ronaldo as the best player in the world. “The year I was with him [Neymar] was magnificent,” Emery told Marca. “I learned a lot from seeing his answers in each training session and in the matches. “Neymar has football inside, but also the faculties and the conditions to execute it. “I think he is facing the opportunity to take over from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to be the best player in the world, and he has time to do it.” Neymar has scored 69 goals in 80 appearances for PSG since he joined the club from Barcelona three years ago.

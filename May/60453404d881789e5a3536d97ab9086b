Former Arsenal captain, Thierry Henry, has hit back at Kevin De Bruyne after the Manchester City playmaker warned him he was coming for his Premier League assists record. De Bruyne was just four behind Henry’s tally of 20 assists before the coronavirus crisis saw English football take a break. The Belgium midfielder has made no secret of his desire to break Henry’s record, which was set in the 2002/2003 season. However, Henry speaking with De Bruyne’s team-mate, Aguero, for PUMA Football, made it clear that the City star must also score more goals. “When you see Kevin [De Bruyne]… because the other day he told me that he’s willing and trying to provide more than 20 assists. “He has 16 already, right? Yeah, that’s right, 16, and the record in a season is 20. And I hold the record. “So he said the other day that he wants to beat it. But I told him that with those 20 assists, you will have to score 24 goals as well! Not only assists!”

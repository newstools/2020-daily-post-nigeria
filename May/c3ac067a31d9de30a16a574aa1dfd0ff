Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, is yet to resume training even as Serie A players returned on Monday, SportsMail reports. The Italian league has been suspended for two months due to the COVID-19 outbreak. But the Interior Ministry has given the go-ahead, for players to return to club training. Ronaldo arrived from the Portuguese island of Madeira and will have to spend two weeks in quarantine. Italy’s Sports Minister, Vincenzo Spadafora, has warned that although individual training can resume, training in groups must wait until May 18. “Nothing has changed compared to what I have always said about football. “Team training will not resume before May 18 and the resumption of the championship, for now, is not really discussed,” he said.

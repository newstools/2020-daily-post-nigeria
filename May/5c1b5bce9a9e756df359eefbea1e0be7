The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had fixed the 19th of September, 2020 for the poll. On Sunday, a party chieftain in Edo, Dickson Imasogie, told newsmen in Benin that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will be defeated. Imasogie noted that with congresses concluded, the party was on the right path to producing the next governor. He recalled that party leaders had adopted the no-zoning formula to choose party officials and the governorship candidate. Imasogie pointed out that with the emergence of state party chairman from the Edo Central Senatorial District, permutations favour the Edo South district to produce the governorship candidate. “With the list of aspirants in its fold, the APC is picking its candidate from Edo South. Whether it is the incumbent or a fresh candidate, they are all from Edo South. The political battleground is here in Edo south, with the district still favoured to produce the PDP candidate,” he said. The chieftain revealed that the PDP was set for a large number of decampees from the ruling APC. “PDP remains virile, potent and optimistic ahead of the governorship elections. The party is getting ready for the primaries that would produce the candidate of the party”, Imasogie assured.

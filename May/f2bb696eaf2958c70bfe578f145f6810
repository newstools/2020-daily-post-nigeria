An outspoken Nigerian pastor, Adewale Giwa, has told the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government to open churches in Nigeria to enable pastors heal all coronavirus patients in the country. In a statement to DAILY POST on Sunday, Giwa said the government should do this to show they are not hiding anything from the people. He said, “There is a spirit that came with COVID-19 that has blocked the eyes of majority of Nigerians. “The religious leaders must pay serious attention to this spirit of deception. “Can’t you see how they are making jest of us on the internet? The devil is at work, and all hands must be on deck to win this battle. “It shall not be well with the devil and all that brought this staged pandemic to deceive Nigerians. “They brought to Jesus all who were sick, afflicted with various diseases and torments, possessed with demons, epileptics, and paralytics; and he healed them, according to Matthew 4:24. “If there is nothing that the government is hiding, let them reopen the churches and bring the victims to the house of God. “I know the God whom I serve, and I strongly believe that He is able to heal all diseases. I took up this Ministry with pure conscience. “The most painful thing is that there is a division in Christianity. However, does that stop God from answering our prayers? No. “I can tell you boldly that the true men of God are few, and only God knows His servants. “Jesus Christ said in the book of John 10:14 that He knows his sheep and his sheep know him. If you are for God, you will definitely know that you are for God.” It's a shame Buhari can't give Nigerians N5,000 as COVID-19 lockdown palliative - Pastor Giwa Coronavirus: We're all fake believers - Pastor Giwa blasts Christians COVID-19: Pastor Adewale Giwa begs Gov.

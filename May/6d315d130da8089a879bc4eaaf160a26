The Bauchi State Government has said that 41 persons died of Lassa fever from January to date in the state. Dr Rilwanu Mohammed, Executive Chairman, Bauchi State Primary Healthcare Development Agency (BASPHCDA), disclosed this in Bauchi on Saturday, stating that Lassa fever is deadlier than Coronavirus. Mohammed explained that a case of Coronavirus reported early has greater chances of being treated, but most cases of Lassa fever are reported late, leading to the high number of deaths reported. He said “We just recorded another two deaths resulting from Lassa fever. This has brought the total number of deaths as a result of Lassa fever to forty-one. “Coronavirus has been with us since 23rd of March this year, however, we have only recorded three deaths as a result of the virus. “Most Coronavirus cases reported early have greater chances of recovery compared to Lassa fever infected persons. According to him, Lassa fever patients seek medical attention late. ”They don’t report to the hospital until they start having fever and start bleeding from faeces before they report and by then it is already too late. “Now we have 41 people who have lost their lives due to Lassa fever in contrast to only three deaths from Coronavirus,” he added. He said the state government has intensified training of staff on how to carry out effective fumigation and spraying. He further informed that the government would be embarking on massive spraying and decontamination of communities to combat Lassa fever in the state. However, he urged residents to also contribute their quota by always reporting any suspected case of Lassa fever in the state as early diagnosis and treatment could help patients recover, NAN reports.

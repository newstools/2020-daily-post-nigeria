Tottenham Hotspur Manager, Jose Mourinho, has revealed that losing a Champions League semi-final to Bayern Munich in 2012, pushed him to tears. Mourinho was manager of Real Madrid at the time and was eyeing his third title in the competition. The Portuguese had previously won it with FC Porto and Inter Milan. Mourinho ended Barcelona’s dominance under Pep Guardiola that season and was seeking to clinch Madrid’s 10th Champions League title. However, Los Blancos lost via penalty kicks, with Cristiano Ronaldo, Kaka and Sergio Ramos all missing from 12 yards. “That is also football. Cristiano, Kaka, Sergio Ramos. They are three monsters of football, there is no doubt about that. “But they are also human. That night was the only time I have ever cried after a football match. “I remember it well: me and Aitor [Karanka] parked the car in front of my house, crying. It was very hard to take because in that 2011-12 season, we were the best team in Europe,” Mourinho told Marca.

Pennsylvania Governor, Tom Wolf, has rejected comments by United States President Donald Trump on business reopening amid coronavirus global challenge. Trump had approved that some categories of businesses could open under strict instructions. The order went into effect May 1 but some States are calling for caution. On Monday, Trump publicly supported calls by a section of Pennsylvania people demanding an immediate lifting of restrictions. Proponents in counties in the eastern State are threatening to defy the governor’s orders and reopen their businesses. “The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails. The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purpose. Don’t play politics. Be safe, move quickly!” Trump tweeted. But the Democratic Governor has disagreed. Wolf insists that the pandemic remains a threat and that he would follow the science and move carefully. “I don’t know how you stay safe and move quickly. We are trying to move deliberately,” he said. Wolf further issued a stern warning that businesses violating orders could lose their health certificates and other licences. America has recorded nearly 1.4 million cases of coronavirus and 81,000 deaths.

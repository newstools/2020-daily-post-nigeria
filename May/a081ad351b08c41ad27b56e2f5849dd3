The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Friday, handed over a property forfeited by former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Allison-Madueke to the Lagos State Government.  The mansion is to be used as an Isolation Centre for COVID-19 patients. The property consisting six flats of three bedrooms and a boys’ quarter was forfeited by Diezani, a minister under the Jonathan administration, following an order of Lagos State Federal High in 2017. Speaking during the handover ceremony, the Lagos Zonal Head of the EFCC, Mohammed Rabo, stated that the gesture was part of the commission’s social responsibility efforts towards the fight against the spread of Corona virus.  “In addition to our mandate to fight economic and financial crimes, the Commission is committed and ready to render essential services that may be required of it in the fight against COVID-19. “Therefore, Lagos State should not hesitate to call on the Commission anytime the need for such essential service arises,” he noted. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu thanked the commission for the gesture, noting that it was a welcome collaboration between the Federal and Lagos State Government. Sanwo-Olu assured that that the property would be put to good use. He thanked the EFCC for paying attention to Lagos efforts at containing coronavirus. “Part of the challenges we have been facing is getting isolation centres for COVID-19 patients. We will go round the facility to see what we can do to improve on it”, Sanwo-Olu said.

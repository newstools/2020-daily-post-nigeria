Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said all his players have recovered from injury. Speaking to Sky Sports, Mourinho, however, admitted the players will struggle to play to their maximum due to the lack of match time. Before the COVID-19 break, Spurs had a number of injury issues, including Harry Kane’s hamstring problem, Heung-Min Son’s arm injury, plus extended absences for Steven Bergwijn and Moussa Sissoko. During their time out, Mourinho and the team were knocked out of the FA Cup and Champions League. “I cannot say in this moment they are ready to play because one thing is to recover from an injury, and another is to be ready to play football. “For us, of course, it is a great feeling, because we finished the period with that defeat at Leipzig, where we were really, really in trouble to have 11 players, including attacking players, and in this moment (Erik) Lamela, Son, Dele (Alli), Harry Kane, Bergwijn, everybody is fit now,” Mourinho said. Although there is no agreed date for resumption, the Premier League are looking to restart with Tottenham taking on Manchester United at home.

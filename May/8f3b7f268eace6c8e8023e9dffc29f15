Ogun Sate Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, on Thursday, relaxed the lockdown imposed on the state to flatten the curve of the coronavirus pandemic. Governor Abiodun, who stated this while addressing newsmen on the efforts of government to fight the spread of the deadly virus said the state residents can now move around from June 1. However, Abiodun said residents are not allowed to go out on Saturdays and Sundays, saying lockdown must be observed weekends. At the press briefing, Abiodun disclosed that Ogun residents would be allowed to move around from morning till evening, unlike before when they were only allowed to be outside between 7am and 5pm. He, however, reminded the people that the presidential curfew from 8pm to 6am is still in place. In his words, Abiodun stressed that the relaxation of the lockdown does not mean the pandemic is over, adding that all COVID-19 guidelines must be obeyed. According to him, the ban on interstate travel, the use of face masks and the observance of social distancing must not be violated by any person. On the reopening of worship centres, Abiodun hinted that the guidelines will be finalised in the next one week as that will be done alongside religious leaders.

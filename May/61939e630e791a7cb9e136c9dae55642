Manchester United legend, Wayne Rooney, has advised manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to play midfielder, Paul Pogba, in a more advanced midfield role. Rooney believes Pogba can become an ‘incredible’ player for Man United if Solskjaer allows him to make more runs into the box of the opponent. According to him, playing the 27-year-old in a similar role to the one Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, was given during his playing career at Stamford Bridge would allow the Red Devils to get the best out of the France World Cup winner. “You ask any striker or central midfielder, and they will tell you one of the hardest things to deal with is a centre back who comes out with the ball,” Rooney wrote in his column for The Times. “Another nightmare is the Frank Lampard type, the midfielder who runs past you: with Lampard when the ball went wide you knew he would be off, sprinting into the box and he was one of those about who Fergie would say: ‘This player is not a one-man job — you have to pass them on.’ “He would say that about some you wouldn’t imagine: Stephen Ireland was one, Jermaine Jenas another, purely because they were willing to run beyond your midfield and with those players, there’s going to be a crossover movement from when your central midfielder is dealing with it to when your centre back is. “One lapse of team concentration at that moment and the best – like Lampard – punish you. “That’s why I would love to see Paul Pogba playing deeper and attacking the box the moment the ball went wide. “He would score more goals, and with his good feet, his athleticism, he would be an absolute nightmare. “I would use him in that role – it’s one where, if he developed in it, he could be incredible.” EPL: Solskjaer speaks on Pogba 'faking' injury to force Man Utd exit EPL: Ighalo in, Pogba out from Man Utd training ahead of Chelsea clash EPL: Van Persie reveals Man Utd players responsible for 2-0 defeat to Arsenal

The Yobe State COVID-19 Committee on Prevention and Control has disclosed that the state has now 20 confirmed coronavirus confirmed cases. Vice-Chairman of the Committee, who also doubles as the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Mohammed Lawan Gana, made the disclosure in Damaturu on Tuesday, while fielding questions from newsmen shortly after presenting preliminary verbal autopsy findings with regards to reported mass deaths in the state. “As at today, we have 20 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 4 people died out which three died here in Damaturu, while one died in Nguru isolation centre. “However, all the people that died are from suspected cases because samples were collected before and then sent for testing but by the time the results came after they have died,” he said. According to him, all the deceased presented very late to the health facilities and then they were put on isolation. “Almost all of them had underlying chronic illnesses,” he added. DAILY POST observed that Yobe State still has 13 confirmed cases, 12 cases on admission, 0 discharged and 1 death according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, (NCDC), hence contradicts the committee’s claims.

There was a mild drama at the Federal Housing Authority, Lugbe as some pastors tried to evade arrest by the FCT Task Force COVID-19 Enforcement Team. The pastors, Ibitoye Kayode of the Liberty Faith Gospel Church, Pastor Joshua Olaniru of Liberty Gate Ministry and Pastor Vitalis Udeazi of Dominion Chapel denied ownership of the large crowd worshipping on the hilltop on the arrival of the task force team. The tasks force team on getting to the venue could not differentiate between the worshippers and their religious leaders but after a brief interrogation the three pastors were identified from the crowd although Udeazi tried to conceal his identity. According to him, none of his members were present at the time the members of the task force arrived the mountain but unfortunately for him, some members identified him as their pastor. Also, Olaniru, was identified in a video conducting service before the arrival of the task force team after denying that he wasn’t a member of the congregation. Chairman of the task force, Ikharo Attah, expressed disappointment with the clerics for denying the large group of worshippers. He said “So no one among you agrees that anyone came to worship with them even when they turned out in large numbers. “One of you even went ahead to deny being a pastor and that is very disappointing,” he added. He further warned them against holding worship service in defiant of the presidential directive. However, the clerics were arraigned before the Mobile court presided by Magistrate Idayat Akonni and fined N5,000 each in addition to three hours community service. See video below.

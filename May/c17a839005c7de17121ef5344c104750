A female secondary school teacher and three men have lost their lives when unknown gunmen attacked a fast food joint in Nzharuvo community, in Miango District of Bassa LGA of Plateau State, late Thursday evening. President Miango Youth Progressive Association (MYPA), Nuhu Yakubu, who confirmed the incident, said the attack happened at 9pm at a fast food outlet. Yakubu said, the lady who owns the food outlet and the three customers, were eating noodles served to them when the gunmen attacked and killed them. He added that the fifth victim was gunned down in another location close to the first, while a fellow was lucky to have escaped. He, however, disclosed that in the early hours of Friday, around 1 a.m. precisely, a strange vehicle with 10 passengers was intercepted around Jebbu Miango, about 2 kilometers from the scene of the incident and that the passengers who could not satisfactorily explain their mission, were handed over to the police. When DAILY POST contacted the Police Public Relations Officer, Plateau State Command, ASP Ubah Ogaba, he said the Command was aware of the incident, but cannot give full details of the attack at the moment. Ogaba said, “We are aware of the incident, but awaiting full details of the attack from the DPO in charge of the area”. Miango District and its surrounding villages have for some years now been a subject of attacks by suspected Fulani herdsmen, which has claimed about 500 lives and property worth millions of naira destroyed, leaving a huge humanitarian crisis behind. Also, just recently, the Irigwe community had squabbles with the settler Hausa community, leading to the loss of lives on both sides. Last week, a peace committee was inaugurated with a view to reconciling the aggrieved parties and ensuring lasting peace in the community.

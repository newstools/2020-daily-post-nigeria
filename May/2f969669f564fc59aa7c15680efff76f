The UK government on Wednesday released new guidelines that sports clubs and athletes will follow ahead of the English Premier League (EPL) resumption date. DAILY POST recalls that the UK government had a few days ago given EPL and all other top-level sports in England the green light to restart the season next month but behind closed doors and without spectators until a coronavirus vaccine is found. EPL is currently suspended indefinitely, with nine matches remaining due to the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe. However, Sky Sport reports that the Department for Digital, Culture, Media, and Sport (DCMS) issued a document on Wednesday featuring guidelines designed to allow each sport to make a risk assessment on when it’s safe for training to resume amid the COVID-19 crisis. “I know our sports stars are keen to get back to training, and this guide will enable them to do so in a safe way,” said Oliver Dowden, Secretary of State for DCMS. “Our top priority is protecting the health of athletes, coaches, and support staff. “Enabling athletes to get match-fit is an important milestone towards restarting competitive sport behind closed doors – but we have not given the green light yet. “We are clear that this can only happen on the advice of medical experts and when it is safe to do so.” Coronavirus: English Premier League set out full plans on completing season EPL: Premier League provides update on resumption date after meeting with 20 clubs COVID-19: UK govt gives Premier League date to resume season

Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, on Friday lifted the ban on religious gatherings across the State with immediate effect from May 15. Mr Uchenna Orji, Commissioner for Information and Orientation, disclosed this in a statement issued in Abakaliki on Friday as part of measures to ease COVID-19 lockdown in the State. He added that the decision was made following an appeal from by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in the State. He, however, announced that all churches are to observe their services only on Sundays from 9.am to 11.am. “The re-opening of the worship centres must however, be under strict observance of the state laws and must be once a week. “Seventh Day Adventists and Muslim faithful are to observe their services on Saturdays and Fridays, respectively and also from 9.am to 11.am. “No religious centre shall permit more than 50 people and worshippers must observe a minimum of two metres social distancing from one another,” he said. Orji said that wearing of face masks, washing of hands with running water and use of sanitisers must be strictly observed in all religious centres. “No religious service is allowed to hold any other day than the days specified herein and which must be in strict observance of all COVID-19 laws and regulations,” he added. He urged CAN to close down any religious gathering and arrest the principal of the worship centre, which violates this order, NAN reports. Orji told religious leaders to use the medium to advise members on the need to ensure strict compliance and discipline.

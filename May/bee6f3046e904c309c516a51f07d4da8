The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, has lamented that Kogi State never accepted the assistance rendered by its official in trying to trace COVID-19 patients in the State. NCDC DG, Director-General, Chikwe Ihekweazu was reacting to the misunderstanding between the body’s official and the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello. Bello had asked officials of the NCDC to leave the State after they refused his directive of going into isolation and being tested for COVID-19. The State’s Commissioner for Information, Kingsley Fanwo, in a statement, wondered if NCDC officials had something to hide by refusing to be tested for COVID-19. However, Ihekweazu said Bello was saddled with the primary responsibility of the health security of his State. The NCDC DG spoke during the Presidential Task force on COVID-19 daily briefing in Abuja, yesterday. According to Ihekweazu: “You can only offer help where the help is wanted. Yesterday we offered that help but it wasn’t in a place where the help could be accepted. “Unfortunately, that is what happened last night. The reality is that we have had a great relationship with Kogi. “We have supported Kogi State in every possible way. It is one of the first states that has an Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) supported by the NCDC. “I think in the long term, the purpose of our existence is to support the states. They have the primary responsibility of the health security in their state.” COVID-19: NCDC reacts to Coronavirus report on Abba Kyari Nigerian newspapers: 10 things you need to know this Saturday morning We desperately need RNA extraction kits for COVID-19 test - NCDC DG, Ihekweazu cries out

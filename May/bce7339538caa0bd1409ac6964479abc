Despite the warning by the Kwara Police Command to market leaders in the state to comply strictly with the guidelines on the relaxed COVID-19 lockdown order, traders and buyers have refused to observe the safety protocols to curb the spread of the virus. DAILY POST visit to Ipata market among others in Ilorin, the state capital on Saturday, showed that majority of the traders and buyers deliberately refused to wear the face masks or observe social distancing guidelines. Aside this, the regulated time of operation from 10am to 4pm daily is also being flouted as some markets still operate beyond the official time stipulated by the government. On Friday, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Mr. Abimnola Sokoya, had in a letter to Iyalojas and Babalojas of all markets in the state, warned them to either comply with the safety guidelines of the state government in the efforts to mitigate the spread of Coronavirus in the state or face legal actions. The DCP noted that it had come to the notice of the command that the marketers were operating beyond the official time allowed by the government while the wearing of face masks and social distancing safety protocols were not being observed by traders and buyers in the markets. Sokoya then urged the market leaders to co-operate with the state government in ensuring strict compliance or face the consequences of their violation of the order by being arrested and facing prosecution.

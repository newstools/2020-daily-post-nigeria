Coronation Merchant Bank has commended Nigerian workers for their relentless services to the nation. This was contained in a statement on Friday to commemorate the 2020 May Day. The Bank specially thanked health workers in the frontline of COVID-19 response. “Today, we celebrate all our health care workers that are on call, working long hours and tirelessly trying to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic”, it said. “Without them, the country would be overwhelmed by the Coronavirus pandemic but they are risking everything to make sure we conquer the virus. “Aside from being a day to celebrate workers, May Day is also a distress call. Hence, we are calling on all Nigerians to mask up and stay home as much as they can so that the efforts of our health care workers will not be in vain.” “Happy Workers’ Day from all of us at Coronation Merchant Bank”, the statement added. In April, Coronation Merchant Bank Limited held its 5th (virtual) Annual General Meeting (AGM).

Former Manchester United and England defender, Gary Neville, has advised the English top-flight league that the best way to resume the 2019/20 season is to play the remaining matches in another country that is free from the Coronavirus pandemic. DAILY POST had reported that the Premier League is currently suspended indefinitely, with nine matches remaining due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic across the globe. “If the Premier League were serious about delivering the matches that remain in the safest environment, they would move it to one of the two or three places that are within 3 or 4 hrs of this country that are Coronavirus-free, or virtually Coronavirus-free,” Neville told Sky Sports. “They would take the Premier League over to that country and the players, broadcasters; the media will be quarantined for one week before delivering it in an environment that has proven it can handle COVID-19. “There are places in Europe that have not recorded Coronavirus cases at this moment, which could handle the League finishing.”

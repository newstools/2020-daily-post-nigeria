The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Friday insisted that “President Muhammadu Buhari has led Nigeria backward by 60 years.” HURIWA maintained that the past five years of Buhari’s administration has been an embodiment of “inaction and systemic inefficiency.” It lamented that the state of human rights violations in the past five years has assumed epic proportions just as impunity, lawlessness and lack of respect for the sanctity of human life have become so widespread that many parts of Nigeria are currently in a state of civil war. HURIWA made the remark in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko and it’s National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf. The rights group said thousands of Nigerians are killed by hoodlums and criminals while the government allegedly does nothing about it. The statement reads partly: “As Nigerians observed a low key fifth anniversary of the current administration headed by President Muhammadu Buhari, it has been observed that due to cumulative inaction and systemic inefficiency, Nigeria’s national security has become so endangered as thousands of Nigerians are slaughtered by all kinds of freelance armed hoodlums and terrorists whilst the Government stands by and does nothing to put an end to these killings”. “The current government has dragged Nigeria backward in terms of all identifiable human development indices by about 60 years or more. “The unfortunate scenario is that since the last five years, top government officials have misused their powers to turn Nigeria into a police state thereby clamping journalists who write unfavourable news stories into detentions with lots of framed up and trumped-up charges”. HURIWA described as laughable that whereas the Federal government identifies the armed Boko haram insurgency group as terrorists, it has rather chosen to treat armed Fulani herdsmen and the murderous attackers in the North West States of Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto as mere armed bandits.

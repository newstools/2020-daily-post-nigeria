The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has backed federal government’s decision to accept COVID-19 organic from Madagascar. Recall that the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Boss Mustapha had stirred controversy recently when he disclosed that Nigeria would accept the COVID-19 herbal cure. But one of President Muhammadu Buhari’s media aides, Tolu Ogunlesi, had maintained that the President did not “order” the alleged COVID-19 cure from Madagascar. Madagascar was said to have given the cure to African countries and Nigeria accepted the gift. Speaking with DAILY POST, AYCF President-General, Yerima Shettima welcomed the development so long as it would cure COVID-19 infected Nigerians. He, however, expressed disappointment that Nigeria had to import cure from Madagascar despite the level of professors in the country. According to Shettima: “with the level of professors we have and exposure as a country, one would have expected that Nigeria should come first before Madagascar in finding solution to COVID-19. It’s unfortunate that we are relying on Madagascar. “However I won’t have known the reason we have all of these roots but feel more comfortable importing this cure from Madagascar. “Since that is government’s wish, as long as Nigerians will be safe and those infected will be cured, it’s better they immediately import the organic herb. “Any procedure on how to do it may not be necessary now because we need a short term approach to this issue so we can save more lives before it’s too late.” Madagascar: Nigerian govt under attack for ignoring local medicine Presidential aide, Onochie gives reasons Buhari can't reject Madagascar's herbal solution for COVID-19 COVID-19: Buhari's aide insists President did not 'order' Madagascar cure

A former Nigeria international, Sam Sodje, has said that former Chelsea defender, Celestine Babayaro, is the greatest Nigerian footballer to ever play in the English Premier League (EPL). Many Nigerians have played in EPL, including the likes of Austine Okocha, Kanu Nwankwo, Osaze Odemwingie, Obafemi Martins, Yakubu Aiyegbeni, Joseph Yobo and John Obi Mikel. But according to Sodje, Babayaro had a huge influence on the EPL and opened doors for other Nigerians to come into the league. When asked for the greatest Nigerian to ever play in EPL, Sodje told Brila.net, “You have to give respect to likes of Yakubu Aiyegbeni, Efan Ekoku for scoring plenty goals and the players who played more 50 games in the” premier league. “So I give respect to Yobo, Mikel, but I won’t lie to the Nigerians who brought influence on Premier League are Babayaro and Kanu, but I love Babayaro and will say he is the best.” Daniel Amokachi names Mikel Obi greatest Nigerian player EPL: Thierry Henry names Nigerian player who made playing for Arsenal easy EPL: Rio Ferdinand reveals favourite Nigerian player

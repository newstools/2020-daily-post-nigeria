An Ilorin based legal practitioner, Aliyu Lawal has urged the Kwara State Government to arrest and prosecute violators of the use of facemask in the state. Lawal while speaking to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday, revealed that, since the relaxation of the lockdown, some residents have decided to ignore the NCDC guidelines He explained that many people have also ignored the state government’s order for the compulsory use of facemask in the state. “Despite the level of compliance with the use of facemask, some sections of the public still move around without a mask. “It is time the government did something fast on them. Arrest the violators and make them scapegoats. Nobody is above the law. “Security agents must stand their ground to enforce the use of facemasks. Arrest whoever fails to use the mask irrespective of his or her social status. “I expect the people to cooperate with their leaders to end the COVID-19, not to frustrate the authorities. We need to unite to wipe out the deadly pandemic,” he said. Lawal, however, pleaded with the residents to adhere to proper hygiene and follow the safety measures put in place by health officials to remain safe.

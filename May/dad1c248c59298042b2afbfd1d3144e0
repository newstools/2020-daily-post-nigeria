Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole, has lamented the poor testing capacity of coronavirus suspected patients in Nigeria. Oshiomhole speaking on Arise TV warned that 3% of Nigerians have not been tested for Coronavirus yet the country’s Coronavirus curve is not flattened rather it keeps increasing. The APC chairman made the statement while responding to a question on how Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, recovered in less than one week. Oshiomhole stressed that most countries relaxed restrictions because their COVID-19 curves had been flattened. According to him, this is not the case in Nigeria, as limited testing has made it difficult to confirm accurate figures of positive cases. “That is not what we are seeing and it appears that because Nigeria has a limited capacity for testing, until you test, you can’t confirm. “You cannot know more people who are affected more than the number you are able to test. We have not tested three per cent of Nigerians. “The evidence that we see from the numbers generated every day suggests that the curve is going up.” He advised health and public officials to be mindful of their statements with respect to COVID-19 cases in Nigeria. Oshiomhole further warned against minimizing the consequences of the deadly virus, adding that countries with advanced health systems have recorded high deaths. “I heard someone saying that without any cure it will naturally go away. That’s a dangerous statement to make. “About 60,000 persons, how come we have such kind of death in Spain and in Italy with all the advancement in tech and the health care infrastructure,” Oshiomhole added.

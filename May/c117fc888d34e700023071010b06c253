Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Akin Abayomi, has said they go in search of patients who go missing after their samples have been tested for COVID-19. Abayomi, speaking during a press briefing on Friday, said such patients flee their homes and cannot be reached on their mobile phone lines. According to him, this is one of the reasons the isolation centres in the states are not fully occupied. “There is also a situation that we experience; when we test people, sometimes they find it difficult to find them. The ambulances will go into communities, people will flee their homes, and they make it difficult for us to find them. “If you have tested positive, we expect you to cooperate with us and make yourself available so that you can be admitted and accessed. “Our isolation facilities are really comfortable. It is not like the Ebola days; we have made a lot of improvements. Members of the executive and senior people in government have been admitted into those facilities. If I test positive, I will go to one of those facilities,” Abayomi said.

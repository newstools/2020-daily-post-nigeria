Inter Milan Football Club has announced that the result of the coronavirus test carried out on its players, including Victor Moses and Romelu Lukaku, as well as the coaching and management staff, have returned negative. The Serie A giant made this known in a statement on its official website on Sunday night. It said: “FC Internazionale Milano announces that all of the results from Friday’s medical tests on the club’s players, coaching staff, management staff, and the remainder of the team group have returned as negative.” Inter and other Serie A clubs are allowed to resume group training from Monday, having been permitted to return to team bases for individual sessions on May 4. The Serie A and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) are yet to agree on medical protocols set by the government for the competition’s return amid the coronavirus pandemic. DAILY POST recalls that the Serie A had been suspended since March 9 due to the spread of COVID-19 across the world. Serie A clubs had all agreed some days ago to play out the rest of the current season rather than cancel or end it at its current stage.

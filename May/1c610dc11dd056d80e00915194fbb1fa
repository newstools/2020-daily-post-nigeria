Former Barcelona president, Sandro Rosell, has rated Neymar as the second best player in the world behind Lionel Messi. Rosell, speaking with Radio Marca, also urged Barca to re-sign the Brazilian. Neymar was sold to Paris Saint Germain in 2017 for a world record €222million fee. However, he has been linked with a return to Camp Nou and Rosell believes the LaLiga giants should do all they can to bring him back. “If I were the president of Barca, I would try to sign Neymar. “He is the second-best player in the world after Messi and fits perfectly into the philosophy of the club,” he said.

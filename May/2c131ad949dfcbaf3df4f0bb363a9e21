The federal government has appealed to Nigerians to donate their buildings to be used as isolation centers temporarily. Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire made the appeal at a press briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 in Abuja, adding that more testing by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control in the next three months would require more buildings as isolation centers. The minister sad, “I have appealed to citizens to make their property available temporarily for this purpose. I am sure that after that, many property owners will come up and donate to state governments for a period to be used for this function.” He added that currently, the government was not out of space for patients but merely thinking ahead of the outbreak. “We are not out of space now, but we are making the appeal ahead of time so that we have these facilities ready,” Ehanire added. Meanwhile, the Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, Chikwe Ihekweazu, on Thursday said the health agency is struggling for bed spaces to accommodate COVID-19 patients across the country.

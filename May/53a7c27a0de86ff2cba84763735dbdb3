Princewill Osarojiji, owner of one of the hotels demolished by the Governor of Rivers State on Sunday has been expelled by the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Osarojiji is the Youth Leader of the party for Eleme Local Government Area. Recall that Wike had also declared Osarojiji of Eleme Alode Ward 2 wanted with N5 million bounty placed on his head. Osarojiji was accused of alleged criminal activities that led to the demolition of the Prodest Hotel at Eleme. A statement from the office of the outgoing PDP State Chairman, Felix Obuah, said Osarojiji has been expelled. The PDP further accused him of insubordination, flagrant rascality, disobedience to the directives of the State government on COVID-19 and acts of criminality. The statement also claimed that the Osarojiji carried out a criminal action against the state’s task force. He said: “It’s very unfortunate that the Eleme youth leader took his position as a party executive for granted to flout the authority of the governor and orders of the state government by attacking members of the task force on COVID-19.” The PDP alleged that the former youth leader organised a party in a hotel in Eleme to rubbish the efforts of the government to contain the pandemic. “I believe this will serve as a deterrent to others who may wish to engage in similar act to test the sincerity and political will of the state government to deal decisively with such recalcitrance.” Rivers lockdown: Wike declares PDP youths leader wanted, marks hotels for demolition COVID-19: Why I demolished two hotels - Wike PDP demands Buhari's whereabouts, backs Wike's demolition of Rivers hotel

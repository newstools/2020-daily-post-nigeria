Nearly a thousand people displaced by the communal crisis in Tigno, Lamurde Local Government Area of Adamawa State have registered at the camp opened for them at the Kupte Primary School near Lafia town. Two communities in Tigno had clashed last weekend, with residential buildings razed, making the dwellers homeless and prompting Governor Ahmadu Fintiri to direct the establishment of a temporary camp for them. The councillor representing Lafiya ward in Lamurde LGA, Abubakar Yahaya, disclosed that so far, 978 people displaced by the Tingno communal crisis have registered at the Internally Displaced Persons ((IDPs) camp in Lafia. Yahaya who is also the camp chairman, said the camp register was building up as more people were turning up to register. He said the camp, which was opened on Sunday, was running out of important facilities. “We are grateful to the government for its quick response in opening the camp and providing food, drugs and other consumables. But we need more canopies, mattresses, and even clothing to make life easier,” he said. He explained that life was tough at the camp because a lot of the IDPs lost all they had to the crisis and were beginning a new life.

Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero, has admitted players are “scared” about resuming Premier League action as the COVID-19 outbreak lingers on, the UK Mirror reports. Some clubs have already began training, with the players placed on an individual workout in compliance with social distancing rules. On Friday, the 20 top flight teams will hold further discussions, on how the season can be restarted. Part of the ‘Project Restart’ discussions will centre around the use of approved venues, which may mean teams playing on neutral grounds. Aguero has now claimed that some players have reservations about returning. He said: “The majority of players are scared because they have family, they have children, they have babies, parents. “When we go back, I imagine that we will be very tense, we will be very careful, and the moment someone feels ill, you will think: “What’s gone on there?” I hope there is a vaccine so all this ends. “It does scare me, but I have just been here with my girlfriend. I haven’t had contact with other people. “They say that there are people who have it but who don’t have symptoms and they can infect you. That’s why I’ve stayed at home. You can be infected and you don’t know anything about it.”

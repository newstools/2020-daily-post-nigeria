Senegalese legend, El Hadji Diouf, has named Nigeria legend, Austine Jay Jay Okocha, as the most talented football player in Africa. Diouf, who played alongside Okocha at Bolton in England, said he has never seen anyone like the former midfield maestro since he was born. The former Liverpool forward also identified Cameroon legend, Samuel Eto’o and Ivory Coast legend, Didier Drogba, as the two best players in Africa. “The two best African players of this decade are Samuel Eto’o and Didier Drogba but on the other hand the most talented one cannot say that it is Diouf, It is impossible,” Diouf told RSI, as per Press-Sport. “The most talented African football since I was born is Okocha. “He’s the most talented player I’ve ever seen, but he didn’t win a trophy, he didn’t win a gold ball.” 2019 CAF Footballer of the Year: Diouf names player that will win award Samuel Eto'o, Ayew's brothers, react to Pape Diouf's death Marseille ex-President, Pape Diouf dies of coronavirus

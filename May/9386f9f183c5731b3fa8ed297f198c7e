Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, met with the five Emirs in the state on Tuesday. The parley was on the battle against coronavirus. Ganduje briefed the monarchs on measures being taken to contain the spread of the disease. The governor told them to take decisions reached to their Emirates and people. “Our concern is to break the chain of transmission of the pandemic. This is why this and similar meetings ‎are necessary. COVID-19 affects ‎all aspects of life: our religious obligation, economy, culture as well as our social settings,” he said . Emir of Kano, Aminu Ado Bayero, on behalf of the emirs, assured of their support. “We are aware of the giant steps being taken by the government to prevent its spread. There is an urgent need for us traditional rulers to complement the efforts by sensitisatising our subjects to join the crusade,” he said. However, the Kano government has extended the lockdown of the state. Kano has recorded nearly 700 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 32 deaths.

Two men, Umar Garba,24, and Rabi’u Ya’u, 21, on Thursday drowned while bathing in a pond at Zainawa village in Gezawa Local Government Area of Kano State on Wednesday. Malam Saidu Mohammed, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of Kano State Fire Service, confirmed the incident on Thursday in a statement made to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kano. According to Mohammed, the incident happened on Wednesday afternoon when the two men went to take a bath. “We received a distress call on 13 May from one Malam Ibrahim Ya’u at about 3:32 p.m. that the bodies of the deceased were found floating in a pond,” he said. “On receiving the information, we quickly sent our rescue team to the scene at about 4:00 p.m.” The spokesman said that the corpses had been handed over to the village head of Dakata Village, Malam Bala Ibrahim. Mohammed also advised the general public to call the fire service on time in an emergency to save lives and property. He, however, called on parents and ward heads to enlighten their wards and subjects to refrain from bathing in ponds and rivers.

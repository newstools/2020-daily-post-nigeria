Some parents in Lagos State are against plans to reopen schools. Earlier this week, the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, spoke on plans to divide classes into morning and afternoon sessions, in a bid to reopen schools across the country. Speaking to NAN on Thursday, some parents noted it was important for the federal and state governments to continue to safeguard children from the COVID-19 pandemic. Ayobami Ojo, a civil servant, who resides in Ikotun, asked for the children to stay at home until the pandemic is effectively contained or a vaccine is found. “There is no need of considering any morning and evening classes for now; let the children continue to stay safe at home as the virus is increasing every day,” he said. A businesswoman, Abiodun Aina, who resides in Ayobo, said: “It is difficult to control adults, let alone children, we should not risk the lives of children. A two-shift option for classes may not stop the spread of the virus. Kayode Jacob, a businessman, who lives around Iyana-Ipaja, pointed out that university and secondary schools students can be cautioned, but it will be difficult to control nursery and primary school pupils. As at Thursday evening, Nigeria had recorded confirmed 8,733 cases with a total of 254 deaths.

The Chairman of the Christian Council of Nigeria, Enugu State chapter, Archbishop Barr. Christopher Ede, has stated that he did not announce that ban on religious activities have been lifted in Enugu State, as is being erroneously peddled in the media. Reacting to a media report credited to him to the effect that Enugu State has lifted the ban on religious activities, Archbishop Ede, in a statement, wondered how “a state that still bans all religious activities throughout the days of the week both for the churches and mosques can be said to lift ban on religious activities” . The cleric clarified that he only sent a memo to CCN member churches to continue to abide by the rules and regulations of the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) on social distancing protocol and other precautionary measures, “as they seek room for intercession to God to help the nation in the war against the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) beginning from Sunday, May10, 2020” . He added that it was not his duty to announce the lifting of ban on religious activities in the state. “As leader of the CCN in the state my duty is to continue to encourage the faithful to guard themselves against whatever will heighten the spread of the virus”, he said. Consequently, the Archbishop called on the media to embrace accurate and objective reporting in order to help win the war against the virus. According to him, “inaccurate reporting is capable of misleading the public into actions that could make the war against the virus more difficult or spreading fear in the minds of the public”. He, therefore, prayed for God’s intervention in the fight against the pandemic.

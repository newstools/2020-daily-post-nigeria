The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Thursday, said his administration will soon commence the recruitment of 5,000 teachers. Ortom sad the recruitment will commence as soon as fraudulent practices in the state’s Universal Basic Education Board, SUBEB, are tackled. He spoke during the flag-off of 35,000 customized desks and chairs to primary schools across the state. According to Ortom: “The hiring of 5,000 teachers would be carried out as soon as the existing loopholes in the State Universal Basic Education Board, SUBEB are plugged and other forms of fraud are also curbed.” He vowed never to shield anyone found to be involved in corrupt practices. On securing the new chairs and tables, the Governor said he has directed the State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice to design a legal instrument to enable the Government to search the homes of those in the habit of converting the school furniture to personal use. It was the first batch of 61,000 chairs and tables the Ortom administration in collaboration with Universal Basic Education, UBEC, plans to distribute to Benue primary schools this year. Over 30,000 of the customized desks and chairs were distributed to schools across the 23 local government areas last year. Flagging off this year’s distribution, Governor Ortom expressed his commitment to uplifting the standard of education as seen in the ongoing upgrade of school facilities with more contracts for the school projects to be awarded when Government accesses the N2 billion bank facility it is processing. “Investment in education is for the development of the society, and I am passionate about it. That is why I am repositioning SUBEB to make it strong so as to meet the aspirations of Benue people,” he stated. Gov.

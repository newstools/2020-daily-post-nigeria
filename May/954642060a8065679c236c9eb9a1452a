Former Arsenal captain, Cesc Fabregas, has admitted that he left the Gunners two years too soon. According to Fabregas, he was frustrated by Arsenal’s inability to compete with their rivals; Manchester United, Liverpool, and Chelsea at the time, adding that his decision to leave the Premier League side was perhaps premature. The Spanish midfielder left Emirates to rejoin Barcelona in 2011 after spending eight years with the North London club after arriving as a 16-year-old in 2003 from the La Liga giant. Asked why he left Arsenal, Fabregas told Rio Ferdinand’s YouTube channel FIVE: “It was a bit of everything. “I always felt that we were competing against the world. Let’s say you guys [Manchester United], Chelsea, sometimes Liverpool. “I speak to guys at Chelsea and my Spanish friends at Liverpool, and everyone tells me the same ‘we used to hate playing against you guys’. And I say the same: ‘Yeah, you used to hate it, but we always lost’, especially in crucial moments. “I always felt so frustrated to see these big teams winning and still having that edge. I was very young, and I was very passionate. I gave absolutely everything for Arsenal. “I was hungry. I wanted to win. I was a competitor. I would have done anything to win for Arsenal. I felt this was not coming. “We had opportunities to sign big players that would make such a big difference, but for one little thing or another, tiny details they were looking away. “A lot of things frustrated me, and I just decided to go back to Barcelona. They were the best team in the world at that time, with all my friends there. “I took the chance but earlier than I would have wanted. “I just felt it was the right time. My brain was a little bit gone. Deep down, thinking now, I think I should have waited two more years.” EPL: Sagna blasts Fabregas for questioning quality of ex-Gunners teammates EPL: Fabregas reveals how Wenger snubbed him, conversation with Mourinho EPL: Wilshere reveals difference between Ozil, Fabregas

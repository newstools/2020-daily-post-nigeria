Manchester United have agreed a £90million deal with Lyon for Moussa Dembele, the Manchester Evening News reports. The French striker is expected to leave in the summer transfer window and join the Old Trafford outfit. Dembele’s decision to leave may have been hastened by Ligue 1’s decision to call off the season. It leaves Lyon in 7th place and out of European competitions for next term. Although United themselves are currently 5th in the Premier League, Dembele sees a move to the Red Devils as “a dream”. United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is expected to be in the market for a forward again this summer, although the club may choose to sign Odion Ighalo on a permanent deal. Dembele fits the profile, having scored 22 goals in all competitions for Lyon this term.

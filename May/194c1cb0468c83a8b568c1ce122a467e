The 2019 governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun, Buruji Kashamu, has accused former state chairman, Bayo Dayo, of selling out. Kashamu, in a statement on Wednesday, challenged Dayo to give accurate accounts of what led to the PDP crisis in Ogun. The state chapter recently inaugurated the new Executive Committee led by Samson Bamgbose. The former Senator recalled that four weeks to the end of his second term as the state chairman, “Dayo decided to betray those he had led for eight years and purportedly sold 65 percent of the party structure to Hon. Ladi Adebutu”. He noted that it was the lopsided sharing ratio that some party stalwarts wanted to use to set up an “imaginary” caretaker committee. “This is the same group that signed a three-year agreement with the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) on the 7th of March, 2019. The agreement is still valid till 2022 as it has not been renounced till date.” Kashamu stressed that Dayo’s reconciliatory move was not motivated by altruistic intention and lamented that huge resources and years of efforts to strengthen the PDP was “traded”. The politician quipped: “Can Sikirulai Ogundele, who is on the other side, enter into any agreement or negotiation with anyone without carrying Hon. Ladi Adebutu and other stakeholders along”. Insisting that the ex-PDP chairman allegedly negotiated for “pecuniary gains”, he called for a thorough investigation of the allegation by Olayinka Soneye. “In his statement to the police and affidavit in court, Soneye said Dayo told him that Ladi Adebutu offered him N100 million to trade off the PDP structure in Ogun State”, Kashamu added. Calls to Dayo’s number for his reaction went unanswered as at press time.

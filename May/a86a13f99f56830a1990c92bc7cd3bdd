Arsenal star, Dani Ceballos, has said that he wants to contest for a regular role at Real Madrid following his loan spell at the Gunners. Ceballos said this after Arsenal took a final decision on his future at Emirates a few days ago. The Spaniard’s current deal at Arsenal expires at the end of June 2020. The 23-year-old midfielder joined the North London club in the summer of 2019 on loan from Real Madrid. Ceballos has now indicated that he wants to convince Real Madrid coach, Zinedine Zidane, that he is worthy of a first-team place at the Los Blancos. “I am happy, and I have a contract with Real Madrid,” Ceballos told Deportes Cuatro. “I am 23 years old, and I’m not over the hill yet. “Now, I feel much more a player, and I am prepared for any challenge that comes my way.”

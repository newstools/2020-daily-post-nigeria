Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna lawmaker, has reacted as Nigerians returning home due to coronavirus pandemic are told to offset their two-week quarantine bill on arrival. DAILY POST had reported on Friday that the Nigerian government in a revised guideline asked returnees to pay for their two weeks stay at isolation centers. Before Friday, the returnees were only required to pay for their flight back home while the government took care of them for two weeks in their various isolation centres. But in the letter by the Embassy of Nigeria in Bangkok, Thailand, which was signed by the Head of Chancery, Nicholas P. Uhomoibhi, and dated May 14, each returnee is to pay N297,600 for quarantine and feeding in Nigeria. Reacting, Sani took to his Twitter page, condemning the move by the federal government. According to him, the government should not expect patriotism from Nigerians outside the country if they have to pay to be evacuated. His tweet reads: “If distressed Nigerians in Diaspora have to pay to be evacuated and have to pay for isolation centers when back home, then we should formally paste a Cheque Book on our National flag and affix a Bank note to our Coat of Arms. “Expect no patriotism from a man abandoned by his country.” COVID-19: Stranded Nigerians returning from abroad to pay for their 2 weeks quarantine Give Nigerians in isolation centres N20,000 - Shehu Sani tells Buhari COVID-19: Some Nigerian returnees from Ivory Coast positive, 67 quarantined - Lagos

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday said it sent an additional 88 Rapid Response Team (RRT) to support Kano State Government in the fight against the coronavirus disease which has claimed many lives in the State. The Organization made this known in a statement on Wednesday, adding that the decision was reached to quickly curtail the spread of the disease in the State. The statement read, ”As part of the response strategy, WHO had trained and deployed additional 88 Local Government Facilitators (LGAFs) to support the ongoing COVID-19 response at the LGA level. “The training which lasted between May 2 and May 4, had in attendance 88 newly engaged surveillance assistants who would be deployed to the 44 LGAs. “The 88 surveillance assistants are to strengthen active case search, reporting and contact tracing, risk communication as well as infection prevention and control.” However, the State Coordinator, Dr Jibrin Alkasim, said the rising number of positive cases had thrown up the challenge of following up on several contacts within the state, NAN reports. Alkasim said that the involvement of these officers would support contact tracing and active case search in both public and private health facilities, as well as in communities. According to him, the measure would lead to early detection and notification of cases. “To have a good number of experts that will support response to coronavirus disease, particularly with respect to surveillance and risk communication, we had to train these facilitators to take the mandate to the lower level,” he added.

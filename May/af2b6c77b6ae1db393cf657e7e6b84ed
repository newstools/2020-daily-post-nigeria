President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with Senator Kabiru Gaya over the death of his wife, Halima Gaya. His message, on Thursday, was signed by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu. Buhari described the late Hajiya Gaya as a “remarkable woman, who dedicated herself to promoting education.’’ He commended her for investments in the establishment of private schools. “It is a laudable initiative, which should be emulated by others. Education is the tool for modern development and no country can afford to ignore its vital role in our lives. “My heart goes out to Sen. Gaya and the people of Kano State. May Allah grant them the fortitude to bear this great loss,’’ he said. Buhari prayed God to accept the soul of the departed and reward her good deeds with paradise.

Tottenham Hotspur striker, Harry Kane, has disclosed that Liverpool deserves to win this season’s Premier League title amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. He also said that to resume the season without fans will be strange but insisted that it will be required in order to complete the campaign. DAILY POST had reported that Liverpool was on top of the Premier League table with twenty-five points above second-place Manchester City before the English top-flight league was suspended indefinitely due to the spread of COVID-19 across the world.  “Since the lockdown, we started doing zoom sessions pretty much every day,” Kane told ITV’s Good Morning Britain. “It is going to be a really difficult situation playing without fans. Liverpool deserves the title and to lift it. Without their fans, it will be a strange situation. “We have not been through a time like this in my life, so it is hard to know what the right thing to do is. “The fans are a massive part of football. They make the game what it is, so it will be different to play without them. “I have done it before for England, and it is not the same. But if we want to finish the season, we are going to have to do that.” Coronavirus: Berbatov disagrees with Rio Ferdinand over cancellation of Premier League season EPL: Luke Shaw gives reasons Liverpool should not be awarded Premier League title EPL: Wayne Rooney gives opinion on resumption of fixtures, club that should win title

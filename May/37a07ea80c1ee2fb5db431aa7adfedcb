The founder of LoveWorld Incorporated, Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, has described the use of facemask in public as an embarrassment to science. Oyakhilome explained that wearing facemasks in public was dangerous to human health, stressing that it puts the immunity of human beings at risk. Addressing his members in a telecast, he said face masks are meant to be worn by medical practitioners while carrying out medical procedures. He said: “What we are talking about here is not politics but we are talking about saving lives, some steps being taken did not save lives but put them at risk. They put lives, immunity at risk. “The use of facemask is so embarrassing to science, I have never seen something so embarassing to science. Let’s forget about the politicians and talk about real science. “The medical mask which nurses and doctors use in theaters are not useful in public, they are used in clean environments, in a certain type of environment for a certain purpose, so that is not the kind of people should wear in public, this we understand is the scientific mask that is helpful in a certain environment. This can’t be used in the park or mall.” Following the outbreak of coronavirus, relevant authorities both in Nigeria and across the globe had prescribed usage of facemasks as part of efforts to curb the spread of the disease.

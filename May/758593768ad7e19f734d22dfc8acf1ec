The Judicial Commission of Inquiry set up by Governor Godwin Obaseki to investigate the construction of the Edo Specialist Hospital and supply of equipment has indicted former governor, Adams Oshiomhole. Oshiomhole, the national chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), was found culpable of alleged breach of the state’s Public Procurement Law. Chairman of the commission, Justice James Oyomire (rtd), presented the report of the findings to Obaseki at the Government House in Benin, the state capital, on Thursday. He stated that the award of contract for the construction of the facility was marred with irregularities. Oyomire pointed out that the procurement law states that any contractor working on a government project should not receive more than 25 per cent upfront payment. “The immediate past administration paid 75 per cent of the contract sum upfront for the project to Vamed Engineering”, he stated. Oyomire revealed that the commission’s eight-point recommendations empowers the Ministry of Justice to institute civil and criminal actions against those found culpable in the breach of the law. The recommendations include the strengthening of Edo State Public Procurement Agency and ensuring strict adherence to the provision of the agency’s law on award of contract. In his remarks, Obaseki vowed that anyone found culpable, no matter how highly-placed, will be asked to account for their action. “We have been putting the right measures in place and if there are resources of government that need to be returned back, we will not hesitate to ask for it. “Since I came into office, you cannot find this type of breach you have mentioned. If people have to face prosecution, whether civil or criminal, they will have to be prosecuted”, Obaseki declared.

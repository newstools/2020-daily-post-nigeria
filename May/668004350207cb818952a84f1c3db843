Barcelona defender, Marc Jurado, is set to join Manchester United in the summer transfer window. According to Sport, Jurado is expected to be named among Man United’s academy intake for next season after he rejected a three-year professional contract at Barcelona. The Spanish newspaper reports that the 16-year-old’s transfer was decided earlier this week after “several weeks” of negotiations between Man United and Jurado’s representatives with an agreement now in place. Jurado has been considered as one of the brightest prospects in the La Masia academy. The right-back has spent nine years with Barca’s youth team. Man United are now expected to pay Barcelona a small compensation fee to lure Jurado to England. Meanwhile, the Red Devils have already fought off competition from Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal to agree a £300,000 deal with Sunderland for the 16-year-old striker, Joe Hugill.

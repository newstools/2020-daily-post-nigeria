Anthony Joshua has admitted he “would love to see” Mike Tyson fight again. Joshua currently holds the WBA, IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight titles and says Tyson was his idol growing up. “If he’s back in the ring then I would love to see it, I would definitely be one of the viewers that’s for sure. “That’s the man who got me [into boxing]. “Do you know what it was with Mike, when I watched him on YouTube, I see a little kid that was 13 and I truly believe,” Joshua told British GQ. Tyson became the youngest heavyweight champion ever at 20 in 1986. The American has been posting training videos recently, with reports suggesting he could return to the ring in a series of exhibition fights in Australia.

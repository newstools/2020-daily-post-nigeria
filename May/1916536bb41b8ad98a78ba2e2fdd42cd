Manchester United are not happy with the performance of their first-choice goalkeeper, David de Gea. This claim was made by respected football expert and journalist, Duncan Castles. According to Castles, Man United believe they made a huge mistake by signing a lucrative long-term contract last year with De Gea and would be glad to offload the 29-year-old Spain international should an offer come along for him. “Manchester United are not happy with the performance of De Gea post-signing that record contract,” Castles told Transfer Window Podcast. “They basically put themselves in the position where they had to pay him far, far more money than any other club was prepared to pay him. So they have saddled themselves. “It is a hugely expensive contract for a player whose performances have declined since he signed that contract. “My understanding is that there is a thought within the camp that were someone to offer De Gea a contract and the opportunity to move elsewhere the strategic thing to do would be to take that wage off their wage bill and sell him.” “It is going to be very difficult to find a buyer for De Gea because of the coronavirus situation.” EPL: Peter Schmeichel gives verdict on De Gea after Man Utd’s draw with Everton EPL: Ighalo reveals three Man Utd players that helped him to settle at Old Trafford EPL: De Gea tipped to replace Kepa at Chelsea

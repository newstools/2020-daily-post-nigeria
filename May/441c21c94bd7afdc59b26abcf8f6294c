A truck driver was said to have fled away after crushing two men to death in another Sango Toll Gate road crash. One other woman reportedly sustained serious injuries in the multiple accidents that happened outbound Lagos, along Abeokuta express road around 12:30pm on Saturday. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. TRACE Spokesperson, Babatunde Akinbiyi, said a containerized red-coloured Mack truck, with registration, AAA448XJ; a Dangote Howo truck marked, 7248-16 and a white Mack tanker with number plate, KSF991XF, were involved. According to Akinbiyi, the containerized truck with registration Number: AAA448XJ, had a brake failure and veered to the other lane outbound Lagos. It reportedly had a head-on collision with the Dangote truck and the tanker outbound Lagos. “Two male passersby were crushed to death on the spot and 1 female injured,” Akinbiyi said. TRACE operatives and other sister agencies collectively had rescued the situation by taking the injured to Ota state hospital while the two dead victims were taken to Ifo mortuary. Speaking further, Akinbiyi said, “However, the driver of the accidented truck ran away while the accidented vehicles have been deposited at the FRSC Office at toll gate.” Akinbiyi recalled that two lives were lost in a similar fatal accident on Wednesday at the same spot.

The officials of the Lagos State Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture, led by the Commissioner, Pharmacist (Mrs.) Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuf, on Thursday, embarked on a monitoring exercise of some eateries and restaurants in the State. Akinbile-Yusuf, speaking during the exercise, explained that the monitoring was undertaken to determine the level of compliance with the directives of the State Government on social distancing and restriction to take-away packs only by eateries and restaurants operating in the State. She said: “Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was clear in his address on the gradual easing of the statewide lockdown order and the new guidelines issued to operators of Eateries and Restaurants, which stated that they will be allowed to operate between 9a.m and 7p.m for take-out and orders only.” The Commissioner revealed that the monitoring team visited about eight eateries within Ikeja and its environs, where they observed over 90 per cent compliance with the government’s order, stressing that in places where compliance level was low, the officials took time to enlighten the operators on the expected standard of operation. While listing some of the places visited to include Domino’s Pizza at WEMPCO Road, Ogba; KFC Ifako-Ijaiye Road; Sweet Sensation Ijaiye, Ogba; Tastee Fried Chicken at Ijaiye Road, Ogba and The Place along Oba Ogunnusi Road, the Commissioner said the monitoring exercise would be carried out in other parts of the State.

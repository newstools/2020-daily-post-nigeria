The District Head of Batsari in Katsina, Alhaji Tukur Mu’azu, says his subjects will prefer to die from coronavirus than being killed by rampaging bandits. He said this while lamenting the recent wave of gruesome attacks on villagers in several communities at Ruma and Batsari Local Government Areas (LGAs). In a video obtained by PRNigeria, Mu’azu, who holds the traditional title of Sarkin Ruma Katsina, regretted the rising insecurity in Katsina. Katsina is the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari. Mu’azu said: “My people will prefer to die from coronavirus infection, not from these senseless killings. So far, the deadly pandemic has not claimed any life in Batsari and other neighboring Local Government Areas (LGAs), but the bandits have killed scores of harmless villagers and residents. So, what are we saying?” On the recent attacks on old and new Ruma, the District Head told PRNigeria on the phone at the weekend, that the criminals invaded over 10 communities and killed many Nigerians. He further recalled that the attackers stole cattle and other animals. “The bandits always scatter themselves. Hence, security personnel find it difficult sometimes to contain the attacks. However, we are still calling on the Federal Government to deploy more soldiers, mobile policemen and fighter helicopters to Katsina. Let them comb all the forests and eliminate these bandits,” the traditional leader appealed.

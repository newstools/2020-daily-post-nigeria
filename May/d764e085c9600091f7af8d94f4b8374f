Registrar, Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN), Professor Segun Ajiboye, has appealed to students preparing for major examinations to use the opportunity of COVID-19 lockdown to study well. Ajiboye made this appeal while featuring on a radio program monitored by DAILY POST in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Ajiboye, while speaking, maintained that students in Nigeria must acknowledge the present challenge to education and be ready for post-COVID season where they may have limited period for revision before taking their major examinations. He lamented that no fewer than 62 million teachers are affected by COVID-19 while about 1.7billion children globally cannot attend schools because of the pandemic. Ajiboye, while speaking further, stated that parents must support and monitor their children to study on their own in the absence of their teachers. While insisting that Nigeria must leverage on technology to redesign her educational system, Ajiboye added that the pandemic caught the industry unawares. He disclosed the TRCN was planning massive digital literacy program after COVID-19 has gone to impart new training and teaching skills in Teachers in Nigeria. Ajiboye said, “We cannot be the same again after COVID-19 has gone. We need technology. We need to invest in it. The world is moving and will not wait for us. We must invest in technology to solve most of our problems. “Our teachers and children are at home. Students need to use this compulsory holiday to prepare well for their exams and parents must support them with the right motivation and monitoring to ensure that they are ready for their WAEC, NECO or Junior WAEC.” 'Teachers certificate verification not a witch hunt' - Prof. Ajiboye, TRCN 19,273 teachers fail Professional Qualifying Examination FG vows to flush out unqualified teachers December 31 - TRCN insists

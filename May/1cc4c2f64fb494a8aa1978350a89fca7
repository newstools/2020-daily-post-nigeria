Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has identified his ‘ideal signing’ for the club this summer transfer window. Lampard is eager to bolster his squad this summer after Chelsea failed to sign any player in the January transfer window. One of the major areas the Blues coach is looking to improve in the transfer window is the left-back position. Emerson Palmieri and Marcos Alonso have shared the role without either player stepping up to take full charge of the position. And both Emerson and Alonso have been linked to joining former Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte, at Inter Milan. According to Bleacher Report, Leicester City left-back, Ben Chilwell is the man Lampard wants to recruit for the west London club this summer. Lampard has been a huge admirer of Chilwell since the beginning of this campaign. Chilwell has drawn the interest of Chelsea in the past few months.

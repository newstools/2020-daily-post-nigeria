Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has revealed manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer still criticises him demanding improvements, despite his decent scoring record at the club. The 30-year-old moved to Old Trafford on a six-month loan deal in the January transfer window. Ighalo has since scored four goals in his first eight appearances for the Red Devils. The Nigerian striker has now spoken about how Solskjaer is trying to get the best out of him. “During games… there was even a game I scored in, and he said, “You should have scored more if you do this or do that”. “I thought about it and I know if I would have done what Ole said, I would have scored more. He says: “You’re a striker, take the chance”. “So I’ve learnt a lot from him, in terms of positioning and how to do one or two things in a game,” Ighalo told the club’s official website.

Ander Herrera has opened up on his Manchester United exit. The Spaniard left Old Trafford last summer for Paris Saint-Germain and he has now revealed that it was because of “disagreements” with the board. Herrera left as a free agent after five years at Old Trafford, after contract talks with United broke down. Although he admits he would have love to continue in Manchester, Herrera insists he is happy in Paris. “When I look back a year ago, my intention was not to leave Manchester United,” Herrera told ESPN. “I had some different opinions with the board but I respect them. I respect them a lot. They do things for Manchester United and I disagree with the people who say they don’t. They really suffer when things don’t go well and they really fight to bring Manchester United back.” EPL: Pogba reveals those who asked him to leave Man Utd for Juventus EPL: Di Maria hits out at Man Utd for making him wear no.7 shirt Carabao Cup: Guardiola reveals two clubs he will never manage

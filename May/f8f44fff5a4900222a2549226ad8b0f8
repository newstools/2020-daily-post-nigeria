The Italian government has given approval for Serie A to resume on June 20. This follows a conference meeting on Thursday, which had the country’s Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora, the Lega Serie A, Italian Football Federation presidents, representatives from the Players’ Association and the Association of Italian Sports Medics in attendance. Serie A was the first of Europe’s major leagues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Games were initially postponed and played behind closed doors, before the league was eventually put on hold. Although the Italian Football Federation have not made any official announcement, it is expected that teams will play every three days across three different time slots: 5pm, 7.15pm, and 9.30pm (Italian time).

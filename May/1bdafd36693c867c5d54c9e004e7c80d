Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has denied reports he tried to delay the Premier League’s restart over concerns for players’ fitness. It was claimed Mourinho, during a meeting with other managers on Wednesday, called for players to have at least one month of training before football could resume. However, the Portuguese has hit back at the reports and insists he is “desperate” for football to return. “I don’t think my position in the meeting has been reflected fairly at all today in media reports. I have not asked for any delay. “I want to train, and I am desperate for the Premier League to return as soon as it is safe to do so, particularly now we are seeing other leagues preparing to return to action. “I am extremely proud of the way my players have maintained their fitness – they have shown great professionalism, passion and dedication,” Mourinho said in a statement.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmakers in the House of Representatives, have warned President Muhammadu Buhari against relaxing the lockdown imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In a statement by the PDP Caucus Leader in the House, Rep. Kingsley Chinda, they described the decision as insensitive, callous and counterproductive. According to them, it was motivated by economic reasons, even when the government has not worked on a policy on engagement in public places. The PDP lawmakers said an additional two weeks was needed, to enable the government develop the required policies. The initial four-week lockdown order in Lagos, FCT and Ogun was extended by another week, with gradual easing to take effect from Monday, May 4. “As a caucus in the House of Representatives, we are deeply worried about this and accordingly, hereby express in very strong and unambiguous terms our utmost dismay, concern and total opposition to the stance of the Federal Government to prematurely relax and/or lift the lockdown order in the affected places earlier mentioned, and to hurriedly ask workers back to their offices, while the virus continue to ravage our people and our cities,” part of the statement read. It added: “Also instructive to note is that whilst declaring a relaxation of the lockdown order, beyond the usual campaign on hand-washing; use of hand sanitizers, facemasks and social distancing, the Federal Government obviously did not put in place any other effective measure designed to stop the spread of the dreaded virus.” There are currently 2,388 confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Nigeria. 385 patients have been discharged, while 85 deaths have been recorded.

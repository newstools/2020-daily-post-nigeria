Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, wants a move to London this summer transfer window. This was disclosed by a respected European football expert, Gabriel Marcotti. DAILY POST had reported that Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool are all interested in signing Sancho from Dortmund this summer. “I have been told Sancho would prefer a move back home in other words to London where he grew up,” Marcotti told the BTP Media Network. “But equally, I am sure he prefers a move for wherever it gives him the best package and long term prospects. “Obviously he has leverage, and in normal conditions, a Manchester United move would have happened. “I think if I am Borussia Dortmund, I have taken a big hit, and ideally, I would want to keep him another year. Let him play the Euros, see if his value goes up.” Jadon Sancho agrees terms with Manchester United EPL: Trent Alexander-Arnold welcomes Jadon Sancho to Liverpool EPL: Berbatov gives reason Jadon Sancho wouldn't think twice to join Man Utd

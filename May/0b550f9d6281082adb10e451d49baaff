Operatives of the Kano Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission on Wednesday closed up warehouses at the Singer market in the state. The warehouses were suspected to be hoarding food items and essential commodities in the state. This was disclosed by the Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Muhuyi Rimingado, in a statement on Wednesday in Kano. According to him, 19, 500 bags of flour, 5,120 bags of sugar, 79, 645 cartons of spaghetti and 37, 000 cartons of pasta were seized from the raid. The State anti-graft agency had earlier warned traders engaged in hoarding food items and essential commodities to dispose of the goods or risk seizure. “Hoarding and unnecessary hike in prices of food items are capable of undermining government efforts to stem the pandemic and breach the security of the state. “This action (hoarding and unauthorized hike in prices of goods) is a crime, under the provisions of Regulation 11 (2) (3) and (4) of the Kano State Public Health (Infectious Disease) Regulations 2020. “The action is capable of undermining the security of the state to the fact that a lot of Islamic clerics (Ulama) have been making reference to it in their Ramadan fast lectures. “This is in accordance with Section 39 of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti Corruption Law,’’ he said. DAILY POST also reported that the State Governor, Ganduje, had earlier expressed concern over hoarding and hike in prices of food commodities in the state.

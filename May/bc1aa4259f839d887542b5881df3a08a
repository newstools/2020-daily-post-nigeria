The report by the National Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, that Anambra State registered a COVID-19 case on Thursday, sent panic among residents of the state. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and NCDC guidelines for safety against the disease which were almost being abandoned since the easing off of the lockdown were again adhered to as traders began aggressivE enforcement of the use of face masks, social distancing and washing of hands in various markets. Meanwhile, the Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano in a state-wide broadcast on Thursday night assured the state that there was no need to panic. He said the latest case is a businessman who travelled to Kano and returned on 6th May, beating the closure of the state boundary to enter the state. “The new case returned from Kano on May 6 after a short business trip. It is saddening that despite our efforts to tighten security at the boundaries, this new case was able to sneak back into Anambra State after a trip to Kano. “He is currently receiving attention in one of our Protective Care Centers. His residence has been sealed off and we have commenced aggressive contact tracing to minimize the wave of community spread that might arise from this case.” Obiano said two Covid-19 testing centre approved in the state by NCDC may start functioning next week, and that aggressive community testing has also started in all the 179 communities of the state. “We have commenced aggressive case search in the 179 communities of Anambra State. “This will help us ramp up the numbers in terms of testing and ensure immediate containment of any possible outbreak. We are also hopeful that when our laboratories become fully operational, we shall be able to conduct more tests.” Wednesday’s COVID-19 case is the second in the state. The first was treated and discharged from the Onitsha isolation centre within a week of being admitted.

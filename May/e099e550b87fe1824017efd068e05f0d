Marcus Rashford’s former team-mate at Manchester United, Matteo Darmian, has tipped him to compete with Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe, for the Ballon d’Or in the future Darmian play for four years alongside Rashford at Old Trafford, before moving to Parma at the start of the season. The Italy defender, who won the Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup with United, feels Rashford can go right to the very top. “He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me. If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d’Or winner. “I’m convinced of this. He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he’s very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come,” Darmian told the UK Guardian. Rashford netted 22 times for the Red Devils, before he picked up a shoulder injury early this year.

Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski, on Saturday matched Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, and Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo’s goals records after his side’s Bundesliga 2-0 victory against Union Berlin. Lewandowski scored a goal for Bayern Munich against Union Berlin to become the third player in football history, alongside Messi and Ronaldo to score 40 goals in five consecutive seasons, according to Mirror UK. The Poland international did so from the penalty spot as Bayern saw off Berlin. The victory over Berlin keeps the Bavarians top of the Bundesliga table and further cements Lewandowski’s place in history. Only the great Gerd Muller ranks above Lewandowski in Bayern’s all-time scoring charts. Lewandowski is now on course to break his single-season goals record, which currently stands at 43. The 31-year-old achieved that number in the 2016/2017 season but has at least another ten games with which to better his current total.

The apex Igbo sociopolitical organisation, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has reacted to claims by Northern elder, Tanko Yakassai who had described President Muhammadu Buhari as an incompetent leader. Ohanaeze’s Secretary General, Barr. Uche Okwukwu insisted that Buhari has done well since assuming power in 2015. Yakassai, a former Presidential Adviser had said Buhari’s inability to fix some of the problems shows he is incompetent However, Okwukwu in a chat with DAILY POST maintained that such was Yakassai’s opinion and does not reflect the general perception of Nigerians. Okwukwu stressed that Buhari has done well in the area of Agriculture. He said: “Tanko Yakasai is an individual who has the right to express his opinion and it can’t be the opinion of the greater percentage of Nigerians who voted for Buhari. “There was an election and Buhari won even in Yakasai’s state, perhaps he voted against him but Buhari still won the election. “Tanko Yakasai and his co-travellers should be patient till 2023 when they should present an alternative to Buhari and see if they will win. “For now, Buhari has the mandate of Nigerians to rule till 2023 and we all have to be patient and support him till then. “Of course, Buhari has done well in the area of Agriculture. Nobody can take that away from him. “If he had not taken the initiative he took in the Agricultural sector, now we would have had kwashiorkor in this country. “From the inception of his government in 2015, Buhari appealed and persuaded Nigerians to take up Agriculture as if he knew that a time will come when to import food will be very difficult.” Buhari is incompetent, can't fix Nigeria - Northern elder, Tanko Yakassai 2023: Northern power brokers reportedly abandon Tinubu Buhari remembers everything - Ohanaeze faults Nnamdi Kanu on clone allegation

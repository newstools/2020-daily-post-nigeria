The police in Ogun State said they will start arresting anybody seen on the street without a face mask. DAILY POST recalls that Governor Dapo had earlier threatened that individuals who go out without face masks will be arrested, quarantined and prosecuted. On Wednesday, the State Commissioner for Environment, Hon Abiodun Abudu-Balogun, said residents of Ogun were disobeying the orders of Gov Abiodun which are aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19. In a statement on Thursday, by the State Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, the command said it will “apprehend and deal with anybody caught moving around without a face mask.” Abimbola stated further that the state Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, had ordered his command to impound any vehicle, tricycle or motorcycle caught carrying more than the required passengers in violation of COVID-19 containment protocols. According to him, such defiant drivers or riders will be arrested and prosecuted. The state police command said it observed that some residents and transporters were flagrantly disobeying government’s directives in mitigating the spread of coronavirus pandemic. It, however, warned that the police will no longer tolerate the habits of those violating government’s restriction orders, like social distancing and the use of face masks in Ogun State.

Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has given reasons the Red Devils should not sign midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, from Barcelona this summer’s transfer window. DAILY POST recalls that Coutinho has been linked with a move to Man United in the past few days. Coutinho is presently on loan at German Bundesliga champions, Bayern Munich, from Barcelona until the end of the season. Bayern Munich has already made it clear that they would not sign the 27-year-old Brazilian on a permanent deal once his loan expires at the end of the season. Coutinho joined Barca for £142million from Liverpool in 2018. But Berbatov believes it would be pointless for Man United to sign Coutinho, adding that they already have the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Paul Pogba, and Scott McTominay. “Other people will see Coutinho linked with a move to Man United, but honestly, the Red Devils do not need him right now,” Berbatov told Betfair. “Man United got Bruno Fernandes, who is a very similar player. He has hit the ground running and looks to be a very promising signing so I do not think there would be any point for Man United to sign him. “Also, Pogba is coming back, Fernandes is there, McTominay is producing great football as well, and they have enough quality there so signing Coutinho would be pointless.” EPL: Why Pogba, Bruno Fernandes may not play together - Berbatov EPL: Rio Ferdinand suggests club Coutinho could join in Premier League Transfer: Coutinho offered to Man Utd ahead of summer transfer window

The federal government has said schools and hotels will be used as isolation centres, in the event of overflow of COVID-19 patients. The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, stated this during the Presidential Task Force media briefing on COVID-19 on Thursday. As at Thursday evening, Nigeria has a total of 8,733 confirmed coronavirus cases, with the number increasing by hundreds every day. Lagos State for instance, has the highest number in the country, with 4,012 patients. Ehanire expressed optimism that the situation in Nigeria would not “experience horrific scenes of bed space shortages seen in some European hospitals.” According to him, there are over 112 treatment and isolation centres in 35 states and Abuja. However, not all states have up to at least 300 beds prescribed for isolation and treatment. “In event of overflow, we can require hotels and school dormitories to be prepared for level 1 (Quarantine) and level 2 Isolation (of COVID-19 positive with zero or mild symptoms), to free hospital beds to be dedicated to level 3, (moderate to severe cases) and level 4, (high dependency and Intensive care unit). “I therefore, call on activists and philanthropists to work with state governments in concerted steps to scale up non-pharmaceutical measures and beef up infrastructural assets for isolation and treatment in their states,” Ehanire said.

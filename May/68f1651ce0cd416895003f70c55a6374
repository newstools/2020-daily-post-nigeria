According to an eyewitness who pleaded anonymity, “I and six others were taken to Sector 1 headquarters of the Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) near Jos Zaria Road new stadium, in a military patrol van. “We were never told our offence, but they tortured us for over an hour before releasing us. “On our way out, at the gate of the headquarters, some soldiers asked us to run. When we took off, they opened fire. Bala fell a few meters from the gate. “I stopped to help him up but a soldier came close, with his gun pointed at me, but turned back when another soldier shouted ceasefire”, he explained.

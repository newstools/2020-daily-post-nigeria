The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has said it is yet to release post-COVID-19 travel guidelines. This was contained in a statement released on Saturday and signed by FAAN’s general manager for corporate affairs, Henrietta Yakubu. “Our attention has been drawn to a statement released by a certain Tayo Olu to the effect that the federal government, through FAAN has released a post-COVID-19 travel guideline for air travellers. “We want to state emphatically that although FAAN is carefully and seriously working on a guideline, the release did not emanate from us as it is still a work in progress. “Consequently, the authority will like to enjoin air travellers and the general public to disregard the content of the said release.” Yakubu also made it clear that FAAN would release the post-COVID-19 travel guidelines via its official communication medium at the right time. The federal government 10 days ago, extended the ban on local and international flights by four weeks, in a bid to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

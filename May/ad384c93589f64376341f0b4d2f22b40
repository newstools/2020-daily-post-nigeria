The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Makurdi Zonal Office, has arrested one George Mbessey. He was nabbed over allegations of conspiracy, abuse of office and diversion of public funds to the tune of N449.5million. The suspect is the Commandant, Benue State Vigilante Group (BSVG). This was contained in a statement on Friday by Dele Oyewale, EFCC spokesman. He was arrested by operatives in Makurdi following a petition urging the commission to investigate a case of alleged financial recklessness against the suspect. According to the petitioners, BSVG used to receive its official funding of N20million monthly directly from the Bureau of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs through its official account. They added that between October 2018 and May 2020, the suspect allegedly collected funds meant for the BVSG to the tune of N449.5million using personal account. The complaints said the act did not follow due process, hence, the petition to the EFCC. The statement added that the suspect has volunteered useful information to the commission and would be arraigned in court as soon as investigation is concluded.

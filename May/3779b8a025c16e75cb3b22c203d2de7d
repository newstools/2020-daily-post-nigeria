Mustapha, who during the daily briefing on Thursday, insisted that the drug has not been approved for use in treating coronavirus in the country. He also apologized to media workers, medical personnel and other essential workers, who were harassed by security personnel in the course of carrying out their duties. “We, therefore strongly warn against self-medication. If you are sick, please seek medical advice and if you are confirmed positive, kindly self-isolate in an approved facility.

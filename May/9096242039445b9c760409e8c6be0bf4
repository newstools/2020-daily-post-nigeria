The World Health Organisation (WHO) says there is no proof yet that coronavirus can be spread by touching surfaces such as handles, doorknobs and keyboards. But on Saturday, the health agency emphasised that its safety guidelines recommends that people disinfect objects. Dpa reports that the guidelines referred to a study that showed the virus could survive on the outside of a medical face mask for up to seven days. The UN agency disclosed that in the study, coronavirus survived on stainless steel and plastic for four days, on glass for two and on fabric and wood for one. WHO said that another study showed the virus surviving for four hours on copper, 24 hours on cardboard and 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel. The body explained that it was important to disinfect surfaces of objects like sinks, toilets, electronic devices and handholds. However, the agency warned against large-scale spraying of disinfectants, either indoors or outdoors, as has been the practice in many Asian communities. It added that streets and sidewalks are not a reservoir for the virus. WHO further discouraged spraying people with disinfectant. “Spraying individuals with chlorine and other toxic chemicals could result in eye and skin irritation, bronchospasm due to inhalation, and gastrointestinal effects such as nausea and vomiting,” it added.

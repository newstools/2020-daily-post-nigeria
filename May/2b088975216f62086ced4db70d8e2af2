One of President Muhammadu Buhari’s media aides, Tolu Ogunlesi, has debunked rumours of a fixed date for the reopening of schools across the country. Institutions of learning have been closed down for almost three months, to contain the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria. However, Ogunlesi on his Twitter handle wrote: “The news circulating about the fixing of a date for schools’ resumption is fabricated / fake. “SGF’s words: “The PTF wishes to inform Nigerians that the Federal Ministry of Education WILL ROLL OUT MEASURES TO BE PUT IN PLACE for safe re-opening of our schools.” “NO dates YET.” The Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, speaking yesterday during the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19’s briefing, specifically denied that schools will reopen on June 8. — Coronavirus: 70 new cases recorded in schools after reopening COVID-19: Uniben extends resumption date indefinitely Coronavirus: FG makes clarifications on reopening of schools

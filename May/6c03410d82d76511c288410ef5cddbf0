Popular Nollywood actress, Rita Edochie has revealed the source of power of controversial Prophet, Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere, popularly known as ‘Odumeje’. There were reports that Odumeje’s wife is the daughter of Eddie Nawgu, and as such the source of his power. Eddy Nawgu was a Nigerian self-proclaimed prophet of God and occult practitioner, who was popular in Igbo land. However, Rita Edochie cleared the air in a post on her Instagram page, stating that Prophet Odumeje‘s strength comes from God and not his wife as claimed. She added that his wife is also not the daughter of Nawgu. In a lengthy Instagram post, she also revealed new details about the prophet’s wife. Her post read: “Odumeje’s source of strength is from God almighty. “UJU OHANEMERE–Odumeje’s Wife Is not related to Eddy Nawgu (the occult practitioner) or Eddy Nawgu’s Wife. “Brief HISTORY of Odumeje’s wife; She was born in the family of Rufus M.Ogbatuo in Obinikpa village in Ideato South L.G.A of Imo state. “RUFUS M.OGBATUO married two wives with 11 children(6 boys and 5 girls).

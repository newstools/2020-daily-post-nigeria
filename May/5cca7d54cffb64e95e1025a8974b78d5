Arsenal defender, Joseph Olowu, has reiterated his desire to play for Nigeria ahead of England. Olowu was born in Ibadan in 1999 and is not age-eligible to join the Flying Eagles at the 2021 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He also cannot play in the 2024 Olympic Games for the West African nation. Olowu is more likely to make his first appearance at international level with the Super Eagles. “It is something I’ve always looked forward to, so I don’t think I would be overwhelmed. “Of course, I’ll be very excited and very grateful for the opportunity but I would not let that affect how I perform. “When the opportunity does come, I’ll take it with both hands and just show what I know I can do and enjoy it for sure,” Olowu told Eagles Tracker in an Instagram Live.

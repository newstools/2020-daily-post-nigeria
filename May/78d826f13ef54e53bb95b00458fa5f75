Manchester United have renewed their interest in Lille striker, Victor Osimhen, ESPN reports. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is believed to have made the 21-year-old his priority. Osimhen has attracted interested from many clubs around Europe, following his impressive debut season in Ligue 1. He scored 18 goals and provided six assists in 38 appearances, before football ended in France due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Lille believe they can break their club-record sale that currently stands at the £72million which Arsenal paid for Nicolas Pepe. United have already dispatched scouts to watch Osimhen earlier this season, and were “impressed” with his displays. Solskjaer is looking for “something different” to Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial with Wissam Ben Yedder and Moussa Dembele also on his radar.

Former Cameroon striker, Samuel Eto’o, has warned Barcelona not to make moves for either Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang or Liverpool’s Sadio Mane. Eto’o joined the LaLiga giants in 2004 and scored 130 goals across five seasons. During his spell at the Camp Nou, he also became the record holder for the most number of appearances by an African player in LaLiga. Barca have been linked with both Aubameyang and Mane, but Eto’o feels both players would not suit Barca’s style of football. He told AS: “With space, Mané and Aubameyang are killing you. “But at Barça, you need players who can move around in small spaces. “I am thinking of players who could adapt to Barça and it is not easy to find one.”

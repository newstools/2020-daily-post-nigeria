Arsenal could have to sell up to six players, to fund the remaining money left to pay for Nicolas Pepe, according to Bleacher Report. The Gunners agreed a club-record Â£72million deal with Lille for Pepe in the summer. The Ivorian winger then put pen to paper on a five-year contract at the Emirates. The deal came as a shock, following suggestions Arsenal had a tight budget to do business with. It later emerged the transfer would be paid in five instalments. The club is now looking to sell up to six players in the next window, to ensure they have the cash to cover the money owed to Lille. Skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and strike partner Alexandre Lacazette have both been linked with a move away from London recently, with Mesut Ozil also named as a potential way of recouping money.

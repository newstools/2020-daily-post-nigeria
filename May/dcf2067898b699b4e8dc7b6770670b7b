Former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi, has supported the President Muhammadu Buhari government’s move to import Madagascar-made coronavirus drink, known as COVID Organic. President Buhari had on Monday directed the Presidential Task Force, PTF, on COVID-19 to pick Madagascar’s cure for coronavirus. The drug named ‘COVID Organics’ is for the prevention and cure of the disease. It was learnt that the consignment coming to Nigeria has been dispatched to Equatorial Guinea from where it will be shipped to Abuja. Reacting, the former governor, however, advised Buhari government to encourage and authorize local inventions in Nigeria. On his Twitter page, he wrote: “I firmly support the authorisation of @MBuhari for importation and subjection of the Madagascar #COVID19 Syrup to standard validation process for pharmaceuticals, and possibly for use in the cure of this virus. “Similar authorisation and encouragement should be given to local inventions. This will save us scarce forex and will give confidence to domestic researchers and inventors.” Buhari issues directive on Madagascar’s COVID-19 cure Madagascar's COVID Organic: Test it first - Shehu Sani tells Buhari govt COVID-19 funds: Peter Obi sends message to Buhari govt

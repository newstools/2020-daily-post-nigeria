The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria, TRCN, has expressed concern that about 1.7billion children have been out of school across the world following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Highlighting the effects of COVID-19 on education globally, the Registrar/Chief Executive of TRCN, Professor Segun Ajiboye, said that 62million teachers had been adversely affected by the pandemic. He, however, urged Nigerian students to vigorously prepare for major examinations. Ajiboye said, “We cannot be the same again after COVID-19 has gone. We need technology. We need to invest in it. The world is moving and will not wait for us.” He explained that there was the need to invest in technology to solve most of the problems facing the educational sector. He added that as teachers and children were at home, students needed to use the compulsory holiday to prepare well for their exams. Ajiboye noted that parents must support their children with the right motivation and monitoring to ensure that they were ready for their WAEC, NECO, or Junior WAEC.

The Police Command in Lagos has arraigned Sulaiman Maiyegun, aka Afobaje, before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court. Maiyegun is the man who beat up his wife and boasted about his action on social media. “I’m waiting for her police”, he wrote on his Facebook page with an image showing the wife’s bloody face. On Friday, Maiyegun pleaded not guilty to two-count charge of assault occasioning harm and offensive publication. The Prosecutor, SP Shinaolu Adeoye, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on May 5, at 12:13p.m, at Maiyegun town in Jakande Estate, Eti-Osa Local Government. He stated the defendant unlawfully assaulted his wife, the complainant, one Mariam Gabriel, by beating her with his fist on her forehead. “The defendant injured the victim on her forehead and posted an inciting and provoking publication about the incident on his facebook page,” Adeoye said. The offences contravened Sections 57 and 173 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Adeoye urged the court to remand the defendant to the Correctional Centre and asked for an adjournment date for the commencement of trial. The defendant’s counsel, Mustapha Danesi, prayed the court to grant his client bail on liberal terms, adding that the matter was as a result of family crisis. Magistrate Mrs Folake Oshin granted Maiyegun bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties who must be a cleric and a family member of the defendant. She directed the court Registrar to verify the addresses of the sureties and ensure that they are tax payers in Lagos. Magistrate Oshin then adjourned the case until June 22, 2020.

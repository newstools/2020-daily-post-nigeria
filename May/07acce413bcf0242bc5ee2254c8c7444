The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has urged Nigerians to ensure personal safety. It claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari has ran out of ideas regarding COVID-19. PDP said as the lockdown is relaxed, Nigerians should protect themselves because Buhari and his government have no plans to rescue them from the jaws of COVID-19. A statement by PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said Buhari had failed to find direction in the fight against the spread of the virus. PDP charged Nigerians not to “resign to fate and jeopardize their lives following President Buhari’s failure to find direction in the fight against the spread of COVID-19 in our country despite the huge resources at his disposal.” The opposition party also described the Presidential Task Foce on COVID-19 as incompetent. PDP said Buhari Presidency and its “incompetent Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 had compounded the situation by crippling the economy after which they are now leaving Nigerians to their fate without providing any therapeutic or operable containment strategy to stem the rising spread and fatalities of COVID-19 in our country. “Our party notes that the inept leadership of Buhari Presidency failed to engage our indigenous medical experts and manufacturers for home grown solutions in therapeutics, test kits and ventilators; leading to an avoidable spike of the pandemic in our country,” the party addef. The gradual lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States as directed by Buhari is expected to start today, May 4.

A medical Doctor, with Federal Medical Centre, Makurdi, Benue State, Ifegbike Kalu, on Friday Harped on the possibility of transmitting COVID-19 through sex. Speaking with DAILY POST, Dr. Kalu said it’s possible to find COVID-19 in semen hence the possibility of transmitting the virus through sex. DAILY POST had reported research indicating that COVID-19 can be found in semen, hence the possibility of spreading the virus through sex. Chinese researchers had said the virus can persist in semen even after patients have started recovering.  Affirming the research, Kalu said: “It’s possible to contract COVID-19 through secretion and respiratory secretion. “Since the body produces other secretions like semen, I think it is possible. I won’t be surprised if we start seeing such.”

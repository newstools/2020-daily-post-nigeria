Some staff members of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have tested positive for coronavirus. The four officials – of Grade Level 6, 7, 8 – have been moved to an isolation centre in Abuja. ThisDay reports that the affected staff live in one of EFCC ‘safe houses’ in Mabushi area. Safe Houses are properties seized by the agency. A source told the newspaper: “Some of our staff have COVID-19. Four living around Mabushi, in one of the safe houses, tested positive for Covid-19.” Meanwhile, all staff have allegedly been ordered by the management to be at work five times a week. This negates the directive of the Buhari administration which states that only officers on Grade Level 14 and above were expected to resume. “I am supposed to be going to work as a senior staff, the junior staff are not supposed to come to work. But everybody has been directed to come. EFCC is flouting the directive of the federal government,” the source added. Calls made to Dele Oyewale, EFCC’s Head of Media, by DAILY POST did not connect as his number was unreachable as at press time.

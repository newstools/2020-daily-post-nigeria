Chief of Air Staff, Sadique Abubakar, has warned bandits in Nigeria to embrace peace or face the consequences. NAN reports that he spoke on Wednesday at a strategic meeting with commanders and instructor pilots at NAF Base in Kaduna. The CAS said it was either the criminals “stop killing innocent citizens and hand themselves over, or we deal with them in such a way that there will not be someone to kill anybody again”. He reiterated his commitment to further liaise with other security agencies to contain security challenges across the country. “I have been briefed of the support the Air force is giving. I have asked them to identify challenges so that we will be more effective in ensuring that we give all the support the ground troops require to ensure that we eliminate this problem once and for all,” he stated. The Air Chief expressed satisfaction with the progress made so far. Abubakar disclosed that a couple of areas that needed improvement had been identified. The CAS hailed troops for their doggedness in the fight against banditry and appealed to the public for useful information.

A leader of the Ogboni Fraternity in the South West was on Thursday killed in Ore, Odigbo Local Government Area of the Ondo State. The deceased identified as Chief Stephen Akinkunmi was said to have been killed within the premises of the Saint Stephen Hotel, Ore. Two persons suspected to be involved in the killing have been arrested by men of the Ondo State Police Command. According to sources, the deceased was shot dead following his refusal to enter his car as ordered by the assailants. The perpetrators of the dastardly act were alleged to have driven the vehicle out of the premises to an unknown destination after the gruesome murder. According to one of the sources, some documents and other items, including money worth N2 million, belonging to the deceased were said to have been taken away by the suspected assailants. The brother of the deceased Mr. Joshua said the gunmen had lodged in the hotel for three days before carrying out the operation. The wife of the deceased, Mrs. Toyin Akinkunmi appealed to the state government and the security agents to protect the family of the deceased as she had been receiving threats from some people. “Some people have been calling us on the telephone, threatening our lives, we want the security agencies to help us arrest the perpetrators, we also want justice.” The State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, who confirmed the arrest of the two suspects, said the command had begun investigations into the incident. “We are after the other perpetrators and we will ensure they are brought to book,” Ikoro assured.

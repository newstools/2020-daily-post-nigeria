The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, says Canada denied Nigerian carrier landing rights for a scheduled evacuation of Nigerians. He, however, assured that further diplomatic negotiations were ongoing on the matter. Onyeama made the disclosure at the daily briefing by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID- 19 in Abuja. “It is true the Canadian Government denied landing rights to a Nigerian carrier scheduled for an evacuation duty, on grounds that the airline does not have a licence to undertake commercial flights to Canada”, he said, He noted that Nigeria’s high commissioner to Canada was arguing that the airline was not a regular commercial flight but an emergency evacuation flight. “Negotiations are ongoing with the Canadian Government,” he said.

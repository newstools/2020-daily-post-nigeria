My name is Kenneth, I. Ekeng… and, the first thing you should know about me is… I am not a doctor.  I’m not an expert on nutrition either. I never went to medical college and I don’t have a degree in anything. But aside from my job, the other thing I consider myself “expert” about is… I Know How Any Person In NIGERIA Can Regain Their Lost Vision In A Very Easy Way!.  I know… because… I CONQUER it.   …And Other Numerous Eye Problems.  Find out here: Healthsolve.org/vision  If you are over 45… and… you have any eye problems… and… you REALLY want to see better without eye surgery,  glasses or eye-drop, I bet this is going to be the most important message you will read this year.  Here’s why! As you may or may not know, when we get older, we usually begin to experience problems with our eyes and our vision. This causes many people to need eye surgery so they have the best vision possible.  Why? Because, usually after the age of 45, the lens in our eyes begin to harden due to natural causes. Our vision becomes cloudy and the lens itself turns brown, blocking off our field of vision.  The truth is, if you live long enough, I can almost guarantee you will develop Cataracts or Glaucoma. It’s a natural condition that affects almost everybody at some point in his or her later life.  In fact, there are over two hundred thousand eye surgeries performed, each year, in Nigeria alone …many of which are performed by inexperienced doctors in less than perfect conditions.  This has led to some scary stories on how some of these eye operations have gone wrong for some patients.  …too many Eyes surgeries are being performed in less than perfect condition all over the country. Those surgery rooms are not even clean, much less sterile. And the environmental conditions are not controllable.  Unfortunately, too many surgeons are putting their own financial interests ahead of their patient’s interests.

First of all, they try to keep us from finding out about safe, cheap ways to Reverse Glaucoma, cataracts, myopia and other eye problems… without… going for surgery.  The second way they cheat us is, they sell us millions and millions of naira’ worth of prescription glasses/lenses that are worthless.  Not only that, many of these glasses are very dangerous, …and they cause refractive errors to your optic nerves.

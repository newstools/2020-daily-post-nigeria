Watford captain, Troy Deeney, has disclosed that people told him they wished his little son contracts the novel coronavirus after he decided not to return to training. Deeney was among few players in the Premier League including, Newcastle United defender, Danny Rose, who criticized the idea of restarting the Premier League season amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Premier League is currently suspended indefinitely due to the spread of the virus across the globe. The English top-flight league on Wednesday took a major step towards restarting matches after all 20 clubs agreed to resume contact training. “I saw some comments in regards to my son, people saying: ‘I hope your son gets coronavirus’,” the 32-year-old told CNN Sport. “That is the hard part for me. If you respond to that, people then go: ‘Ah, we have got him’, and they keep doing it. “In a time where it is all about mental health and everyone says ‘speak up, speak out, please speak’, Danny Rose spoke out, and I spoke out, and we get hammered and battered for it. “So people see that and go ‘woah’, and it’s not just us that gets it, the missus gets direct messages, and you’ll be walking down the street, and people will be like: ‘Oh, I am at work, you go back to work.” COVID-19: Premier League players being treated like ‘guinea pigs’ – Danny Rose EPL: Watford coach reveals why Liverpool lost 3-0, singles out one player EPL: What Solskjaer said about De Gea after Man Utd's 2-0 defeat to Watford

A former Presidential Adviser, Tanko Yakassai, has insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari is incompetent. Yakassai said Buhari’s inability to fix some of the issues he met as president has exposed him as an incompetent president. The elder statesman explained that his long-held conviction that Buhari can’t fix Nigeria’s problems was responsible for his refusal to support all his presidential campaigns. Yakassai, who is based in Kano while speaking via zoom at a video conference organised by governance index, maintained that the past five years of Buhari administration has shown he can’t fix Nigeria. He stressed that the president has failed in the area of electricity, creation of jobs for Nigerians. The former presidential aide said the issues affecting Nigerians which Buhari met are still there five years after assuming power. According to Yakasai: “I have never supported Buhari. I have been against him because I felt he was not competent to handle the job, and I have been proven right. “When President Muhammadu Buhari was elected, I was hoping that at least, we will get stable power all over the country. This is his fifth year. He has only two more active years because the last one year will be for election. “I don’t know what are his plans, when will Kano get electricity to restore its industrial might, so that every man in Kano will be gainfully employed as a result of provision in Kano, likewise Enugu and Lagos among others? Those were the key issues from the time Buhari was elected and they are still the issues of today.”

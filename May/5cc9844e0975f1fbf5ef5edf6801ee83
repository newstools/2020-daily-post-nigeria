The Chief Imam of Lagos, Sulaimon Oluwatoyin Abou-Nolla, has directed Muslims in the State to observe their Eid Prayers at home. He made the call on Friday in a post by Gawat Jubril, Senior Special Assistant on New Media to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The advice was based on the coronavirus situation in Nigeria. The Chief Imam quoted verses of the Holy Quran and teachings of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) which backed the decision. He cited an example of what happened when the companion of the prophet missed Eid Prayers and he observed the Eid Prayer with his family at home. Abou-Nolla noted that the Body of Scholars in Egypt, under the leadership of Grand Mufti of Egypt, agreed that due to the pandemic, according to the Shariah, Eid prayers can be with family or alone. He further outlined how one can pray indoor according to the teachings of the Prophet (SAW). The revered Imam Abou-Nolla is the 10th Chief Imam of Lagos State.

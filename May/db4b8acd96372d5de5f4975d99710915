The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has shelled 33 Boko Haram and ISWAP targets in 2020. The raids conducted in 1,700 combat hours killed a number of the sects’ leaders. Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, made this known in a statement on Thursday. He disclosed that the operations were carried out with 889 Air Interdiction (AI), Intelligence Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Battle Damage Assessment (BDA), Close Air Support and Tactical Airlift missions executed in 1,075 sorties with about 1.6 million litres of Jet A-1 fuel. Briefing the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, at the NAF Base in Maiduguri on Wednesday, ATF Commander, Air Commodore Precious Amadi, said the command was part of ongoing Operation Rattle Snake 2 & 3 and Operation Decisive Edge. Amadi also noted that the ATF has been involved in Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF) offensives against terrorists. He added that the command has continued to provide land and aerial support for another joint military operation “Kantana Jimlan”. In his remarks, Abubakar commended the ATF for the air operations that killed top terrorists and destroyed their camps and facilities. He charged NAF officers and men to remain resolute to ensure total defeat of the insurgents. During the visit, Abubakar commissioned the newly constructed Operations Centre, Non-Commissioned Officers’ (SNCOs’) Mess and accommodation for Airmen. “NAF will continue to do its best to ensure that accommodation problems are eradicated in the Service. I urge you not to relent as we have to continue fighting until the insurgents are completely eliminated. “It is our professional duty to protect Nigeria from the menace of insurgency. Your efforts and sacrifices, both individually and collectively, are highly appreciated. Thus, I re-assure you of continuous provision for the effective discharge of your duties”, the CAS said.

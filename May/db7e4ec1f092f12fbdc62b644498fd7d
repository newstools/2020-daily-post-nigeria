The Imo State Police Command has arrested a 23-year-old Uchenna Mbahotu for allegedly defiling two minors of the same parents, Chinemerem Akagha, 11 and Nmesoma Akagha, 9 years old respectively. DAILY POST gathered that the operatives of the Orji Divisional Police Headquarters, on Wednesday acted on a report brought by the mother of the victims, Mrs. Blessing Akagha and arrested the suspect around Nkwo Orji area of Owerri North LGA of Imo State. According to her, the suspect is a next door neighbour and plays with her two daughters as good neighbours do. “He has used the closeness he had with us to perpetrate the evil act. How could I have known that he is dubious to this extent?” However, medical examination conducted on both children revealed that it was only Nmesoma Akagha that was defiled. The state Police Public Relations Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu said that the suspect is currently in the command’s custody and will soon be charged to court pending the conclusion of investigation

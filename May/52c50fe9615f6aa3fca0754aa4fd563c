The Jama’atul Izalatul Bid’a Wa’ikamatul Sunnah (JIBWIS) has cleared the air over the reported death of its leader Sheikh Dr. Bala Lau. The Sunni based Izala Islamic organization in Nigeria made the clarification on its Facebook Page. It stated that “its national chairman Sheikh (Dr) Abdullahi Bala Lau is alive, hale and hearty contrary to the mischievous story published by online reporters that the Sheikh was dead and social distancing has not been observed during his burial”. “Sheikh Bala Lau is at the moment in Jimeta, Adamawa State for the Ramadan special tafsir that is transmitted live via various media forums without the usual attendance of people due to the challenge of COVID-19 pandemic”. However, the Minister of Information and technology Dr.Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami clarified that the reported death is not the National leader of JIBWIS Sheikh Bala Lau but sheikh Adam Muhammad Gashuwa leader of JIBWIS in Bade local government.

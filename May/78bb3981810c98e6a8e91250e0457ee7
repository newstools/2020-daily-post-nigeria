FIFA has postponed the The Best awards ceremony because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The event was scheduled to be held in Milan on September 21, but the world football’s governing body confirmed on Friday the date will be moved. It is unclear if or when the ceremony will be rearranged, with a FIFA spokesperson saying that “the consequences and different alternatives are being considered”. The last edition saw Lionel Messi and Megan Rapinoe win the best male and female prizes last year. The duo also took the honours at the 2019 Ballon d’Or.

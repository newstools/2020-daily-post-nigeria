The President of the Nigeria Football Federation, Amaju Pinnick, has suggested that Victor Osimhen is a better striker than Tammy Abraham. Osimhen, who was in brilliant form for Lille, has taken the place of Odion Ighalo in the national team. However, Chelsea’s Abraham has snubbed the Super Eagles for England who have now capped him. “We have Osimhen that is doing very well, I cannot tell you that Tammy Abraham is better than Osimhen, it’s not possible. “Let us watch and see the future of these players. We are happy and very contented with what we have right now. The only thing we need to do is consolidate and build a very strong Super Eagles that can contest for the qualifying rounds and World Cup proper. We have a very young team,” Pinnick told Plus TV. Pinnick had tried to convince Abraham and his club team-mate, Fikayo Tomori to pledge their international futures to Nigeria, before they became cap-tied after featuring in competitive games against the Czech Republic and Kosovo respectively in 2019.

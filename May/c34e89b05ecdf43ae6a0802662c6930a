Thierry Henry has revealed that it was easier to play for Arsenal than Barcelona, because of former Super Eagles captain, Kanu Nwankwo. Henry, speaking with PUMA Football, said Kanu and Dennis Bergkamp gave him more freedom on the pitch. The 42-year-old racked up 228 goals in 376 appearances across two spells for the Gunners, winning two Premier League titles, two FA Cups and two Community Shields. He ended his first spell in 2007 to join Barcelona, where he played under Frank Rijkaard and Pep Guardiola. “At Arsenal, I could go wherever I wanted. Like when you [Aguero] played with Diego Forlan. It was much easier for me at Arsenal because I had either Bergkamp or Kanu. “They liked staying in the middle which allowed me to drop back, move on the right side, left side,” Henry said. Barca won a historic treble in Henry’s second season at the Camp Nou, when he, Lionel Messi and Samuel Eto’o combined forces to score 100 goals between them in all competitions.

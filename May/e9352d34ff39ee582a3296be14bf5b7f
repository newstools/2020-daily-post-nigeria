The Federal Government has announced that the Catholic Church in Nigeria has donated its 425 hospitals and clinics nationwide as isolation centers for coronavirus patients. Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 made the announcement on Monday, adding that the increased cases of coronavirus across the country was due to the fact that testing capacity has been increased in the country. He said ”During the first week, the country recorded high cases of COVID-19. ”This is attributable to our expanded capacity for testing with the opening up of more testing centres and laboratories. “As of today, there are 21 laboratories nationwide, including private laboratories. “We have encouraged States to have at least 300-bed isolation centres, including intensive care units. “However, with the increase in cases, we have begun to experience some shortages of bed spaces in the isolation centres. “As part of efforts to support the States in the establishment of isolation and treatment centres, I wish to remind our State governors that the Catholic Bishops’ Conference has offered and volunteered all the 425 hospitals and clinics that belong to the Catholic Mission nationwide for adaptation and use as isolation centres.” He further stated that Governors are encouraged to approach Catholic Bishops and Arch-Bishops in their States to access these facilities. Recall that the federal government had appealed to Nigerians to donate their buildings to be used as isolation centers, temporarily.

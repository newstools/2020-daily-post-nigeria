Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez, has given reasons why Inter Milan forward, Lautaro Martinez, should not leave the Serie A giant amid interest from the Blaugrana. According to Suarez, Martinez would have less prominence in Spain if he joins Barcelona than he does at Inter in Italy. DAILY POST recalls that Martinez has drawn the interest of Barcelona in the past few weeks. The Argentine international is one of Barca’s top targets this summer, but the financial impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) means they are unlikely to meet the player’s £97million buy-out clause. But Suarez wants the 22-year-old to continue his development at San Siro, rather than compete for a place in Barcelona’s attack next season. Speaking to Gazzetta Dello Sport, the Uruguayan international said: “If I were him, I wouldn’t change teams. Deciding on whether to stay or not is very complicated, although if Messi called him, then it would be easy to think about it. “However, we are talking about a boy who is still very young, and he has all the time in the world to go for other challenges in the future. “Let’s say the truth, and he would have less prominence in Spain that he does at Inter. I want to give him some advice: Stay where you are.” LaLiga: Messi reveals striker that will be perfect for Barcelona Lautaro Martinez to Barcelona: Messi speaks out on club’s signing plans Transfer: Barcelona confirm interest in signing Rodrigo as Suarez’s replacement

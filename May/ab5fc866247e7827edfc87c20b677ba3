Speaker, Oyo State House of Assembly, Adebo Ogundoyin, on Tuesday, removed Chairman, House Committee on Works and Transport, Olamide Akinajo. Ogundoyin and Akinajo are members of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in the state. It was, however, gathered that Akinajo, who is Mogaji of Akinajo Compound and represents Ibadan North East 1, is one of the lawmakers that are not satisfied with Ogundoyin leadership style. It was gathered that Akinajo was removed without recourse to the selection committee of the assembly. Ogundoyin shortly after removing Akinajo named Kehinde Taofeek Olatunde from Akinyele constituency II as the new Chairman of the committee. Olatunde is presently House Committee Chairman on Appropriations. Akinajo, while reacting, said that his removal is normal. The lawmaker in a telephone conversation with DAILY POST noted that reshuffle of committee is normal in any assembly. He debunked the rumor of crisis in the assembly. “There is no crisis in Oyo Assembly. It is normal. There is usually intra and inter posting, even in civil service.”

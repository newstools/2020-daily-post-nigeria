The Kwara State Command of the Nigeria Customs Service says it has generated N1.6 b revenue into the Federal Government’s coffers in the first quarter of 2020, even as it warned saboteurs to keep off the command or meet their Waterloo. The command’s Comptroller In-Charge, Ahmed Husseini Bello, also warned officers to shun bribery and corruption or be ready to be shown the way out. Ahmed disclosed this in a statement by the command’s public relations officer, Chado Zakari and made available to newsmen in Ilorin in Wednesday. He said despite the lull occasioned by the coronavirus pandemic, the command generated the sum of N1.6 b representing 21 percent of the command’s annual target of N8.038 b. He said the command recorded 54 seizures with duty paid value (DPV) of N282,198,292.00 in the first quarter of 2020, adding that the total amount of revenue generated by the command since its creation stands at N4.100 b. The Comptroller said efforts were being intensified to identifying and blocking all possible avenues of revenue leakages, enhancing capacity and ensuring disciplinary actions are taken on any erring officer found compromising among others. Ahmed declared that” seizures were successfully accomplished as a result of renewed determination of the Comptroller General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ali to rid the country of all forms of illegal importation.” He appealed to Nigerians to support the command by providing credible information that will help nip smuggling in the bud and generate needed revenue for national development.

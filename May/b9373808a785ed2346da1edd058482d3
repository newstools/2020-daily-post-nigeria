Premier League clubs have agreed to stage a return to training protocols. This would allow teams to start training in small groups from Tuesday. An official Premier League statement on Monday read: “Premier League Shareholders today voted unanimously to return to small group training from tomorrow afternoon. “(It is) the first step towards restarting the Premier League, when safe to do so.” The UK government has already given the Premier League and all other top-level sports in England the green light to restart the season behind closed doors next month. However, the matches will be played without spectators until a coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccine is found.

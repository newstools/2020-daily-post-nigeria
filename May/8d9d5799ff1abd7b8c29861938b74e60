Chelsea are in pole position to sign Derby County midfielder, Max Bird, this summer transfer window. This is as reported by a British newspaper, Daily Mail on Saturday. Chelsea are free to do business in the transfer market again, after successfully appealing against a FIFA-imposed transfer ban earlier this year. The Blues manager, Frank Lampard, worked with Bird when he was the coach of Derby County last season. Lampard is ready to clinch a £4.8million deal for the 19-year-old England youngster to move to Stamford Bridge. When asked about Bird during his time as the Rams boss, Lampard told reporters: “He stands out as a young man. “He is very polite with everyone, he has a real desire to improve, and he is a good team-mate. “Whether it has been for the youth teams or when he has been with the first team, he is an all-rounder. “I have found him to be a great lad, and our relationship is really good.”

Newcastle United defender, Danny Rose, has criticised the idea of restarting the Premier League season, claiming that players in the English top-flight league are being treated like ‘guinea pigs’ as they prepare to play through the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Premier League clubs have been returning to training since Monday after the UK government gave them the green light to restart the season behind closed doors next month. Speaking to The Lockdown Tactics podcast on Tuesday, Rose said: “I’m dying to get back to football but just with the things that are happening right now, people are going through this coronavirus pandemic a lot worse than me, I don’t want to be complaining about everything. “Just off the fact that people are suggesting we should go back to football like we are guinea pigs or lab rats. “We’re going to experiment this phase and see if it works or not. I can imagine people at home saying, ‘Well, they earn that amount of money so they should be going back.’ “For stuff like that I think is it worth the hassle? I could be potentially risking my health for people’s entertainment, and that’s not something I want to be involved in if I’m honest.” Meanwhile, the Premier League on Tuesday confirmed that six positive COVID-19 cases were discovered in 748 players and staff tested this week. The Premier League is currently suspended indefinitely due to the spread of coronavirus across the world.

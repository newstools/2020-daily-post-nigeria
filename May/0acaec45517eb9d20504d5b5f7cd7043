President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the government and people of Sokoto State over the death of Sheikh Haruna Waziri Usman. DAILY POST reported that the 96-year-old uncle of Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwa, passed away after a prolonged illness. Sheikh Tambuwal was the patriarch of the Waziri Tambuwal family. The President, in a statement signed and made available to DAILY POST by his Spokesman, Garba Shehu, said: “Sokoto State and indeed the nation lost a noble and distinguished scholar.” President Buhari prayed that Allah will forgive the shortcomings of the community leader and grant Waziri Tambuwal family the fortitude to bear the loss.

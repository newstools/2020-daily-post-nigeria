Torino defender, Ola Aina, has admitted he chose Nigeria over England, because of a better chance of playing. Aina committed his international future to the three-time African champions, despite earning caps for England’s youth teams. “England was never going to give me a chance to play for the senior team, that’s the difference. Nigeria gave me the pathway to play for their senior team. “I probably would have made it there at some point but Nigeria told me I can make it here now, it was a no-brainer,” Aina said in an Instagram Live chat with the Super Eagles Media Team. The 23-year-old has made 17 appearances so far for the Super Eagles and featured at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.

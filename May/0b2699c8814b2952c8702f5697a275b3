Napoli forward, Dries Mertens, has ruled out the possibility of joining Chelsea this summer transfer window. DAILY POST had reported that Mertens had drawn the interest of Chelsea in the past few months.  Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has held talks with the 33-year-old to discuss a potential move to Chelsea this summer.  According to Sky Sports Italia, Mertens, who has also drawn the interest of Inter Milan, would prioritize a move to the San Siro. Mertens had scored 12 goals in 29 appearances for Napoli so far this season before the Italian Serie A was suspended due to the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe. Belgium international’s current contract with Napoli will expire at the end of June. Meanwhile, Chelsea midfielder, Jorginho, has since hinted on Chelsea’s possible move for Mertens.  Jorginho played alongside Mertens at Napoli before he was signed by former Chelsea manager, Maurizio Sarri, in 2018.

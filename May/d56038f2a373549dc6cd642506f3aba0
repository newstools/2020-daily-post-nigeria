Former Arsenal skipper, Thierry Henry, has said he will not be shocked if current captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang decides to leave Arsenal this summer. Aubameyang, who has netted 17 times in the Premier League this season, has one year left on his current deal. Talks over a new contract have not progressed quickly, with Real Madrid and Manchester United believed to be keeping tabs on the Gabon striker. Arsenal’s hierarchy have made it clear they will now allow players to run down their contracts and are prepared to cash in on Aubameyang if he does not reach an agreement. Henry is sympathetic to Aubameyang’s position and feels he needs to do what is right for his career, with Arsenal likely to miss out on Champions League football again next season. “If you’re an Arsenal man you don’t want him to leave, but also the guy has a career and I don’t know what’s in his head or where he wants to go. “But all I know is that we’re definitely going to miss his goals if he does leave. “Because at the end of the day, I said it when I was at Sky, he was that kind of a “thing”. He does score goals and if you take the goals of Aubameyang away, it’s a tough one,” Henry said on Sky Sports.

The Bauchi State Government has said that the state has recorded a total of 83 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state with one suspected death. The State Chairman Taskforce Committee on COVID 19, Senator Baba Tella, stated this on Wednesday while giving an update of the activities of the committee, at the Government House, Bauchi. He said that as of the May 6, Wednesday 2020, the state recorded three new cases of the virus, adding that 77 patients are currently on admission while 6 patients have been discharged. “We have one suspected death among the high-risk patients awaiting results. Contact line listed so far is 820 while contacts currently under follow-up is 236.” “For the laboratory services, the number of specimens collected so far is 842 while the number of specimens sent to the lab is 791. Total number of results received currently is 688 while number of result pending is 103.” He said that the perceived challenge is that the state will require more bed-spacing and more enlightenment. He said that within the next two and three weeks, the state may experience an explosion because of the relaxation of the lockdown in Kano, Jigawa and other neighbouring states, “so the committee will expand it capacity of more beds in Azare, Bauchi and Toro Local Government Areas of the state,” he said.

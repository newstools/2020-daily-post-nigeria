Manchester City star, Sergio Aguero, has disclosed that Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi will leave Camp Nou for another club only if something ‘catastrophic happens’. Messi has been recently linked with an exit from Barcelona, following his public spat with the club’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, before the 2019-2020 La Liga season was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.  The six-time Ballon d’Or winner has a clause in his contract, which allows him to walk away from Barcelona at the end of this season. But Aguero, an Argentina team-mate with Messi, believes the Barca number 10 will see out his career with the Catalan club. “Leo [Messi] is a player who is already a symbol and Barcelona legend, but things happen in football,” Aguero told El Chiringuito TV. “Many players have changed for Leo, and he stayed in Barca. “He loves the club, he identifies with Barcelona, and he’s comfortable and happy at the club. “No matter how many things happen, Leo will continue [at Barcelona], Unless something catastrophic happens.”

The Premier League clubs have agreed on a points-per-game system, if the campaign cannot be finished, the UK Mirror reports. This follows a meeting on Thursday, during which it was also anounced that the season will resume on June 17. Matches have been put on hold since March due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Two outstanding fixtures – Manchester City vs Arsenal and Aston Villa vs Sheffield United – will kick off the restart. The nine remaining rounds of action will then begin from June 20. There are four different kick-off times for matches on Saturdays and another four on Sundays. All 92 games will be shown live on TV.

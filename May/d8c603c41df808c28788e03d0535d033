Head coach of Nigeria’s Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has insisted that it will be ‘very difficult’ for his team to win the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, title because Nigeria is not number one on the continent. Rohr, who recently put pen to paper for a two-and-half-year deal with the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), has been mandated to win the African top-flight competition in Cameroon next year. “My contract all the time is a risk because it is finished when we are eliminated from a tournament whether the AFCON or World Cup. “I took the risk already when I arrived [in Nigeria], and it is still the same. “But I am very optimistic because now we have a team which is playing good football and I have confidence in my players. “We finished third in the last AFCON in Egypt, and everybody wants us to progress in the next competition [AFCON 2021]. “But we also know that it is very difficult to win the AFCON because we are not number one in Africa, but it’s good to have these milestones and ambition,” the German tactician told BBC Sport.

Lille striker, Victor Osimhen, is being linked with a move to Tottenham Hotspur in this summer transfer window. French newspaper, Le10Sport, reports that the Premier League giant has tabled a bid to Lille for the 21-year-old attacker. Osimhen is believed to be on the list of strikers being targeted by Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho since Spurs top striker, Harry Kane’s future at the club is still uncertain. His current contract with Lille will expire at the end of the 2023/24 season. The Nigerian international is expected to cost around £70 million. Tottenham will have to battle Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United for Osimhen’s signature.

Authorities of the German Football League (DFL) on Monday disclosed that ten players from the country’s top two divisions (Bundesliga 1, 2) have tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19), according to Sky Sports. The ten people tested positive after a total of 1,724 COVID-19 tests were carried out on players from 36 clubs in Bundesliga 1 and 2. DAILY POST recalls that the Bundesliga has been suspended since March this year due to the spread of coronavirus across the globe. The Bundesliga is ready to return to action on May 9 if the German government gives it the green light. “If we start on May 9, we are ready. If it is later, we will be ready again,” DFL Chief Executive, Christian Seifert, said in April. “For us, what is decisive is what the politicians will decide. It is not for us to determine when. “Games without spectators are not what we want, but at the moment, it’s the only thing that seems feasible.”

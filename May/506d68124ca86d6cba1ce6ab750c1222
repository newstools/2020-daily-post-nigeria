Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has appreciated Muslim community in the State for being agents of peace and good neighborliness, reassuring that his administration will continue to provide the enabling environment for all citizens to pursue their lawful businesses and practice their faith without hindrance. Ikpeazu, in a Goodwill message made available to newsmen in Umuahia, by his Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka, on Sunday, congratulated the Muslim Ummah in the State for successfully completing the Ramadan Fasting which is one of the pillars of Islam. The Governor urged Muslim faithful to see this season of the Eid Fitr celebration as period of sacrifice and spiritual renewal, as well as using the lessons of the Ramadan as inspiration for peaceful co-existence with others. Governor Ikpeazu further urged Muslim faithful to abide by the regulations issued by the State and Federal Governments, as well as the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs which banned all forms of public gatherings to celebrate this year’s Eid, a situation occasioned by the outbreak of the COVID-19 Pandemic across the world. He urged them to remain in their homes and pray for the nation and state, especially at this very challenging moment. Ikpeazu however added, “As you engage in the celebrations associated with the completion of the Ramadan period, please remember that social distancing, wearing of face masks, hand washing and all those other protocols enunciated by the NCDC must be observed, including the ban on all forms of non-essential interstate movements”.

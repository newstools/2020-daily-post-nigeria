Former Liverpool and Chelsea defender, Glen Johnson, has given reasons Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, should snub a move to Manchester United and join Jurgen Klopp’s side. DAILY POST had reported that Manchester United, Liverpool and Chelsea are all interested in signing Sancho from Dortmund this summer transfer window. Johnson believes Sancho will not be under any pressure to perform at Anfield, adding that the reverse is the case should he join Man United. “Sancho has been linked with almost all of Europe’s top clubs, but from my perspective, he’ll surely find it very hard to turn down Liverpool if they come knocking,” Johnson told Betdaq. “Liverpool have one of the best managers in the world in Jurgen Klopp, they’re European champions and are going to win the Premier League, so it would be very tough to not be seriously tempted if they were after Sancho’s signature. “If he wants to play in England, no club is able to offer him the success that Liverpool is currently enjoying, and that will surely be a big sway towards him going there. “If he were to go to a club like Manchester United, there would be so much pressure on him to perform as soon as he walked through the door and for someone so young, that’s a lot of responsibility to take on. “He’ll be expected to improve the team overnight, and that simply doesn’t happen, whereas at Liverpool he’d be under so much less pressure to perform. “They wouldn’t need to put him into the team every week, and instead they’d make him earn his stripes. I think that would actually develop him more than just sticking him in from the get-go.” Meanwhile, Liverpool defender, Trent Alexander-Arnold, has since welcomed Sancho, to Anfield. He said: “If he Jadon Sancho came to Liverpool, he would make our team better.” EPL: Trent Alexander-Arnold welcomes Jadon Sancho to Liverpool Sancho gives condition to join Manchester United EPL: Dortmund tell Chelsea, Man United, Liverpool Jadon Sancho’s price tag

Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State has prevented over 100 vehicles from entering the state boundary area with Ebonyi for violating the inter-state travel ban.  The Senior Special Adviser on Media to Enugu State Government, Mr. Louis Amoke, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday in Enugu. Amoke disclosed that the governor turned back the offending vehicles on Saturday night at the Amechi Idodo/Nkalagu land boundary area of the two states.  The statement read in part: “On Saturday evening, Gov. Ugwuanyi paid an unscheduled visit to Enugu-Ebonyi land boundary area to monitor compliance with the ban on interstate transportation aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19. “The governor, who met over 150 vehicles, queued at the Enugu axis of the boundary attempting to enter the state; painstakingly trekked a long distance interrogating the drivers, to ascertain their eligibility for entering the state. “Consequently, over 100 vehicles that were not on essential duties were identified and turned back to Ebonyi State where they were coming from,’’ he said. The governor’s aide added that Ugwuanyi during his enforcement visit met with the Deputy Governor of Ebonyi, Mr. Kelechi Igwe, who was on transit and had a brief discussion with him.

Evander Holyfield has said he is ready to fight Mike Tyson, but wants a ‘no knockout’ rule inserted into their contracts. Now in their 50’s, both Holyfield and Tyson have been training for a return to the ring. They have faced each other twice in the past, with Holyfield winning both fights. The second time, Tyson bit off a chunk of his ear and was disqualified. Holyfield had 29 KOs from his 44 career wins, while Tyson produced a staggering 44 KOs. However, the Briton does not want this bout to be about knockouts. “We have to come up with something that is not a knockout grudge match. It’s not about who can beat who, but to show people we were some of the greatest fighters in our era and we’ve come together as men to do something for others. “I don’t have anything against Mike personally, the thing is I think it would be good for the sport and even though boxing is a rough sport, we can show people we can come together,” Holyfield told The UK Sun.

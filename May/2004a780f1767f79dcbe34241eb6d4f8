Former Cameroon and Chelsea striker, Samuel Eto’o, has tipped Kylian Mbappe to take over from Lionel Messi, as the world’s best player. Messi turns 33 this year, while Ronaldo is already 35. It had led to debates over who will replace them as the best footballers on the planet. Mbappe, who stars for Paris Saint-Germain is still only 21 and Eto’o believes his former Barcelona team-mate has the Frenchman breathing down his neck. “The best current players? I’d have to go with Lionel Messi, who’s more experienced, and Kylian Mbappe, who’s the youngster making the biggest impression,” Eto’o said during a Instagram live with Generation Amazing. “I think he’s going to be the chief global star in the years to come.” Wenger reveals two players to take over from Messi, Ronaldo Messi vs Ronaldo: Kylian Mbappé reveals his role model Messi excludes Cristiano Ronaldo, names five best players in the world

The Adamawa State Government has imposed a 24-hour curfew on warring communities in Lamurde Local Government Area. A statement to this effect said the curfew is government’s response to “the violence that erupted on Thursday, May 14th 2020 and the attendant tension.” The statement, signed by Humwashi Wonosikou, the Press Secretary to Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, said, “Sequel to breach of peace in Tigno Dutse Tito, Sabon Layi and Bagashi communities, Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri has approved the imposition of a 24-hour curfew from 6:00pm to 6:00am with immediate effect.” The statement added that Governor Fintiri views the disturbances as unacceptable, warning that security agencies have been directed to enforce the curfew, and urging residents of Lamurde Local Government Area to shun rumor-mongering and provide relevant information to security agencies. Following the eruption of the communal violence between the Hausa and Chobo people in the indicated communities on Thursday, Governor Fintiri had visited the place on Friday evening, but the communities allegedly continued attacks on each other after the governor left. Sources had said on Saturday that despite the presence of police and military personnel deployed to secure the communities, violence continued wherever the security personnel were not looking. Consequently, by the night of Saturday through Sunday morning, speculations became rife that people had died in their scores and scores others wounded, although no authority has confirmed casualty figure up to Sunday evening when this report was filed.

Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has commiserated with his political rival, Olusola Oke, over the death of his mother. Mrs. Marian Oke passed on at the age of 91 after a brief illness. Akeredolu’s message on Saturday, signed by his spokesman, Olusegun Ajiboye, described the loss as painful. The governor told Oke to take solace in the fact that Madam Marian lived a good and fulfilled life, adding that her memory would forever be etched in the hearts of people. He said it pleased God, “to call mama to eternal rest at such a time like this. I bring the condolences of all the good people of Ondo State to the Oke family”. Oke is seeking to battle Akeredolu at the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primaries. He was recently adopted by the APC Unity Forum to unseat the governor. Others aspirants within the forum are Segun Abraham, Olarewaju Kazeem, Bukola Adetula, Dapo Adelegan, Adelami Owolabi, Akintunde Awodeyi, Jumoke Anifowose, Ife Oyedele and Jimmy Odimayo. In the 2016 APC primaries which Akerdolu won, Abraham emerged first runner-up ahead of Oke, Tayo Alasoadura, Ajayi Boroffice, Tunji Abayomi and others. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had fixed October 10 for the Ondo 2020 election.

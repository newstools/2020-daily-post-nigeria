Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, has advised those with a cure to go through authoritised channels to get certified. Mustapha stated this while responding to questions about the alleged cure from Madagascar during the daily briefing on Thursday. “If you think you have a ‘cure’ for COVID-19, go to the institutions set up by the government to do this, NAFDAC. Do not bring it to the Task Force. “So, my appeal to our scientists and our researchers: don’t bother sending them to the Task Force. “Send them to the institutions that have been set up by government to do their job and we know the institutions,” he said. Mustapha also reiterated that the federal government did not request for the Madagascar herbal remedy for COVID-19. According to him, the Government of Madagascar donated to African countries “in the spirit of African brotherly love”, sending the West African consignment to Guinea Bissau.

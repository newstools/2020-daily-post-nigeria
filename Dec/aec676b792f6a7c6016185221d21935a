The Police Command in Cross River State has denied widely spread rumours that nineteen kidnap and robbery suspects escaped from its custody in Calabar. The Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo in a statement regretted the alleged fake news in the media, explaining that only seven detainees who were in the custody of the Command escaped on December 13th at about 5am. There were rumours in the state that about nineteen suspected kidnappers, armed robbers and other criminals escaped from Police custody. The suspects were said to have been detained in a cell at the Police Headquarters, Diamond Hill in Calabar, waiting to be investigated and subsequently charged to court. Sources claim the suspects escaped between Saturday night and Sunday morning after using a hack saw to cut the key to the cell. The source added that the station guard on night duty and some other officers on duty were detained in respect of the incident. The Commissioner of Police in the State, CP Abdulkadir Jimoh, had recently paraded suspected car thieves, kidnappers, armed robbers, cultists, after his men smashed several criminal gangs. But the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) DSP Irene Ugbo in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Monday evening said, “The attention of the Commissioner of Police has been drawn to an unverified report that 19 armed robbers and kidnappers escaped from Police custody “It is on the basis that the Commissioner of Police wishes to updates the general public. On the 13th December 2020 at about 5am, 7 detainees who were in the custody of the Command for serious offences escaped from the cell “However, 3 died in the process of escaping while one was re-arrested. Meanwhile, efforts are being made to apprehend others. By this, the Command will not renege but have resolved to confront all forms of criminality no matter their forms” the statement added.

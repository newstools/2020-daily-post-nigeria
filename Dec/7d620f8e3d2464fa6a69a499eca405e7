The motion calling for Bello to contest for president was sponsored by the lawmaker representing Olamabaro constituency in the state House of Assembly, Hon. Ujah Alewo Anthony, and was seconded by Hon. Milano Olushola Olumu, representing Ijumu constituency. After deliberation, the House unanimously passed a vote of confidence on Governor Bello over exceptional security, creative governance style, unifying leadership quality, youth inclusion principle as well as affirmative action and gender equity. “Yahaya Bello has been exceptional on security; that is the protection of lives and properties across our joint and several constituencies- a key performance indicator, if not the most crucial, for leadership at all levels in Nigeria today”, the lawmakers expressed.

Timothy Yahaya, the Archbishop of Kaduna Diocese, Anglican Communion, has observed that the year 2020 will not be easily forgotten with the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic that threatened human existence. He also noted that kidnapping, banditry, farmers/herders clashes and other security challenges made the year 2020 not easy to be forgotten especially by Nigerians. The Archbishop made the observation while speaking to newsmen in Kaduna on the significance of Christmas celebration. He stressed that the COVID-19 pandemic had an unprecedented effect on the economic hardship the human race has to battle with but thanked God for His grace upon the life of man to have sustained him to date. Bishop Timothy Yahaya explained that the celebration of the birth of Jesus, whose name ‘Emmanuel’ means ‘God is with us’ has made man to overcome every challenge of life. The Archbishop added that because of the presence of God in the affairs of this country, the outbreak of the COVID-19 coupled with its effects on the economy and insecurity, the country is what it is today. He stressed that the birth of Jesus Christ is evidently clear that God is in the affairs of the country without which, it would be impossible for Nigerians to be what they are presently. He expressed confidence that with God in the affairs of the country, it would overcome all security and economic challenges. Bishop Timothy Yahaya used the message of Christmas celebration to call on all Nigerians to obey the COVID-19 safety measures, saying that Christians are people who obey the law of God and man. The Archbishop called on Nigerians to stop being agents of spreading the COVID-19 pandemic, rather help to curb it.

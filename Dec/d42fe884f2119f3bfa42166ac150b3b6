The House of Representatives has passed a resolution to invite President Muhammadu Buhari, to brief the house on the true state of security in Nigeria. The decision to summon President Buhari was taken at Tuesday’s plenary. The House considered a motion moved by members from Borno State on the recent massacre of 43 rice farmers in the state by Boko Haram insurgents. The debate became rowdy after the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, said it would be inappropriate to invite Buhari to disclose the actions being taken towards handling the security situation in the country. Gbajabiamila described it as counter-productive. Some members of the House opposed the Speaker’s position and this descended into a rowdy debate. The House then went into an executive session to resolve the matter. After the executive session which was held behind closed doors, the House resumed and Representative Ahmed Jaha who is one of the sponsors of the motion moved an amendment to invite the President to brief on the security situation in the country. His amendment was seconded and unanimously adopted. No date was however announced for the invitation.

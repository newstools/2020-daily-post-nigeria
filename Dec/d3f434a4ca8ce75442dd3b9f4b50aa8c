The All Progressives Congress (APC) has postponed the nationwide membership registration exercise scheduled to begin on Saturday. The secretary of the caretaker convention planning committee (CECPC) of the party, John James Akpanudoedehe, made this known during a press briefing in Abuja on Thursday. He said the decision was made due to “the fast-approaching Christmas and End of Year celebrations”. “As you are all aware, the Membership Registration, Update and revalidation Exercise of our Great Party, was supposed to commence on Saturday, December 12, 2020. “However in the interest of our Christian members and the objective of ensuring maximum participation, the CECPC has decided to shift the date of the Exercise to the second week of January 2021. “The CECPC sincerely regrets any inconveniences that may arise out of the change in date; but appeals for the understanding of our teeming members and the general public, in the interest of preparing a solid foundation for a successful Exercise. “The Party wishes you all; as well as members of the public, a peaceful and rewarding Yuletide, and End of Year celebration,” he said.

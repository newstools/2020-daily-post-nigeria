Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has threatened to drop his Chelsea stars, after their 3-1 defeat to Arsenal, insisting “they lacked the basics of football”. The Blues missed the chance to move up to second place in the Premier League after the loss at the Emirates on Saturday. An Alexandre Lacazette penalty and a stunning Granit Xhaka free kick put the hosts 2-0 up before the break. Bukayo Saka looped the ball over Eduoard Mendy for the Gunners’ third in the 56th, before Tammy Abraham grabbed a late consolation that was subjected to a VAR review. When asked if rotation will be necessary ahead of Chelsea’s meeting with Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge on Monday, Lampard said: “Some places, it certainly does. We’ll need some freshness, some people who deserve to play to show they can play on the maximum, on the limit because the Premier League demands it. “You can make games easy for yourself if you want to start well and we’ve had some games like that this season. Today we made it very tough for ourselves to come back.”

Newcastle United legend, Alan Shearer, has blasted Chelsea striker, Timo Werner, for offering nothing following the Blues’ Premier League 3-1 defeat against Arsenal on Boxing Day. Shearer also slammed Chelsea players for lacking creativity against Mikel Arteta’s men. Arsenal defeated Chelsea at Emirates, thanks to goals from Alexandre Lacazette, Granit Xhaka and Bukayo Saka. Tammy Abraham did score a late second-half consolation goal for Frank Lampard’s side. “They [Chelsea] lacked creativity,” Shearer told Match of the Day. “It was not until the 85th minute where they had an effort on target—a lack of intensity and drive and quality in the final third. “When you look at some of the players on show in the attacking third, then this could be a worry for Frank. “[Timo] Werner, who was dragged at half time, did not offer anything in that first half, got into one or two decent positions. “Arsenal had men behind the ball, and they made it very difficult for them,” he added.

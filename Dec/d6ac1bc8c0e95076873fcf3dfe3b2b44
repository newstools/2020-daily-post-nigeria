The Department of State Services (DSS) has arrested the leader of the Monday’s EndSARS protest, Emmanuel Adebayo popularly known as Captain in Osun. According to reliable sources, Adebayo was detained over an allegation against him. It was gathered that Adebayo was arrested on the basis that he was allegedly impersonating the Nigerian Army and receiving accolades on that basis. Sources told DAILY POST that the arrest may not be in connection with EndSARS. It was gathered that Adebayo might not be released until he is charged if the allegation against him is true. Adebisi led the second wave of EndSARS protest on Monday in Osun State. The youths armed themselves with different placards to the entrance of the Osun State House of Assembly when the Speaker, Hon Timothy Owoeye addressed them. The placards read; “We are not fighting for any political party”, “#End Bad Judiciary in Nigeria”, ” #End fake judicial panel of Inquiry in Osun”, “Unfreeze all the frozen accounts”, ” We are Nigerian youths,” among others.

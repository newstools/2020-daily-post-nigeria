Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has identified Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire as the two “irreplaceable players” at Old Trafford. Neville said this ahead of Man United’s away Premier League clash with Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on Saturday. Speaking on the Gary Neville Sky Sports podcast, Neville said: “They [Fernandes and Maguire] are the two players who I think are irreplaceable. “Fernandes is irreplaceable. They are a way off without him. He’s a vital piece of the jigsaw. “Maguire, I think, you would know if he was missing. My gut feeling is that they would miss him enormously. “I know some people say he’s not the best defender in the league, that he’s not done brilliantly since he came for £80m, but he’s a big presence in the heart of the defence. “He’s good on the ball, he’s composed, and he’s good in the air. He doesn’t make a lot of mistakes, sometimes he gets caught, but he’s a good centre back, a really good centre back and a big presence in that team. “Him and Fernandes, I’m not sure they can [rest them] at this moment in time because Ole hasn’t got the luxury to lose a game, unfortunately.” Fernandes joined Man United in 2020 from Sporting CP, while Maguire joined the Red Devils in 2019 from Leicester.

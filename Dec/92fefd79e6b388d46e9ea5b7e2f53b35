Former President, Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, has said that it is too early to talk about returning to office in 2023. Speculations have been flying about, linking the Bayelsa-born politician to a possible return to the office he left 5 years ago. But the speculations may have to continue as Jonathan could not give a definite position on his rumoured ambition. Speaking briefly with reporters on Friday after attending an event organised by the Commonwealth Community Choir in Abuja, the nation’s capital, Jonathan was asked if he would be joining the presidential race for 2023, and he said, “It is too early to talk about that.” President Muhammadu Buhari defeated the then incumbent President, Jonathan in 2015. Recall that some governors of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and chieftains of the party had recently visited Jonathan, as pressure continues to mount on him to contest the 2023 election. They visited Jonathan at his Abuja residence to felicitate with him on his 63rd birthday anniversary.

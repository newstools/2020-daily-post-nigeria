Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said there is nothing wrong with their fans dreaming of a Premier League title. There were 2,000 supporters inside Stamford Bridge for the first time this season. And they watched their team move top of the table with a 3-1 win over Leeds United. It is the first time in more than two years that the Blues have occupied the position and they are now unbeaten in nine matches. Lampard is, however, cautious when it comes to talking up their title chances. “There is nothing wrong with our fans thinking we can win the league. It was great to have them back. You can see how excited they are to be top of the league. It felt like a lot more than 2,000. “But it’s my job to know that it’s a long season. So I’m not thinking about that at the moment, it’s December,” he told a press conference.

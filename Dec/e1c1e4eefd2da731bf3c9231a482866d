Bola Tinubu, a National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Thursday, met with the Governor of Osun State, Gboyega Oyetola and the Minister for Interior, Rauf Aregbesola. The meeting, which was held behind closed-door at the residence of a chieftain of the party, Bisi Akande in Ila Orangun, was to broker peace between Oyetola and Aregbesola. Oyetola, a member of the APC took over leadership from Aregbesola in 2018. However, shortly after assuming power, there were reports of rift between the governor and his predecessor, as Oyetola was said to have scrapped some programmes initiated by Aregbesola.

Arsenal right-back, Hector Bellerin, has said speculation regarding Mikel Arteta’s future at the club is “so unjust”. Bellerin has said the players should be blamed for the poor results. The Gunners have recorded their worst start to a season in 39 years and seats in the 14th place in the Premier League. Arteta has just been in charge for almost one year, during which he won the FA Cup and Community Shield. However, there have been questions about his handling of the team lately, ahead of Sunday’s North London Derby against league leaders Tottenham Hotspur. But Bellerin told beIN Sports: “So unjust. So unjust. As I say, we have to, as players take responsibility for this because I think we all know that Mikel and his coaching team gave us all the tools that we need to win all the games. “When you lose a game it’s always very easy to blame the coach, but also when the coach gives us the tools we have to be the ones to step up. “The way that Mikel plans these games, all the knowledge that they give us before we step on to the pitch is second to none. “Sometimes it’s not that easy, depending on the opponent, but that’s why football is beautiful. If you play the games on the [tactics] board, then it will be a completely different game.”

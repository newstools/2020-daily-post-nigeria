Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest injury updates on Ben Chilwell and Reece James ahead of the Blues’ Premier League tie against Arsenal on Saturday. Lampard said that Chilwell would be doubtful for Arsenal clash due to ankle injury, while Reece’s injury is not too bad. The Englishman said this following Chelsea’s Premier League 3-0 victory over West Ham United at the Stamford Bridge on Monday. Chelsea defeated West Ham, thanks to a strike from Thiago Silva and a brace from Tammy Abraham. “I expect he (Chilwell) will be doubtful for Arsenal. He turned his ankle, tried to carry on, but it was too painful, so we will have a scan or whatever tomorrow and try to see how bad he is,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying after the game. “Reece and Chilly have been doing really well so we hope both their injuries are not too bad and they will be in and around those two games over Christmas.”

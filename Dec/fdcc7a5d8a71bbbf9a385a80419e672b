The Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, NiDCOM, Mrs Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has directed Nigerians abroad to visit the website of the National Identity Management Commission to enable them register for the National Identity Number, NIN. Dabiri-Erewa said that the details of the agents who are accredited to register Nigerians for NIN could be found on NIMC’s official website. She made this known on Monday via her Twitter handle while responding to @woye1 who wanted to know how Nigerians abroad will enrol for NIMC. The Twitter user asked, “Nigerians abroad are asking how will they enroll for @nimc_ng pls @DrIsaPantami @FMoCDENigeria @nidcom_gov @abikedabiri @GeoffreyOnyeama @ProfOsinbajo.” And in response, the NiDCOM Chairman wrote, “Nigerians abroad should visit NIMC website http://nimc.gov.ng for details of their agents accredited to register Nigerians abroad all over the world.” DAILY POST recalls that Dabiri-Erewa’s statement is coming a few days after the Nigerian Communication Commission ordered telecommunications companies to suspend mobile phone SIM cards that are not linked to NIN. However, the Federal Government extended the deadline to connect National Identification Number (NIN) with SIM card registration records. The new deadline is now January 19, 2021, for those with NIN. For those without NIN, the deadline has been extended to February 9, 2021.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-860092" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Abike.jpg" alt="" width="598" height="256" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Abike.jpg 598w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Abike-300x128.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px">

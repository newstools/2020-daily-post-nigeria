Lagos State Government has given a 7-day deadline for the removal of unapproved street gates. Commissioner for Transportation, Frederic Oladeinde, made the announcement in a statement on Sunday. He said gates and structures erected without official authorization contravened the provisions of the State Traffic Laws and Regulations. “Communities have sited gates on some inner roads to avoid vehicular movement on their streets, and this unruly act has contributed to the heavy traffic congestion currently being experienced on our roads on a daily basis.” Oladeinde ordered such areas to leave the barriers open between 5 a.m and midnight or have them dismantled. “The gates must be manned by security personnel engaged by the community or residents’ association and must be opened for emergency services such as police, ambulance, and fire services at any time.” The commissioner disclosed that a committee set up by the Ministry has begun removing gates in locations that failed to comply with the government’s directive.

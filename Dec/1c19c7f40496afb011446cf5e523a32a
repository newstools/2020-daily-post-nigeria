Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has reacted to the Blues’ UEFA Champions League round of 16 draws against Atletico Madrid. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Chelsea would tackle Atletico Madrid in the Champions League last 16. Lampard believes Chelsea have been handed the “toughest” Champions League draw possible this season, adding that Atletico Madrid is a great team that has experience and quality in their squad. According to him, Chelsea would try their best to beat Diego Simeone’s men when the round of 16 fixtures kick-off in February 2021. “I think most people will say it’s the toughest draw we could have had when you go on current form, how they are doing in La Liga, European experience, quality of the team and players, I think most people would say that,” Lampard said as quoted by Chelsea’s official website on Monday. “On the other hand, I think all draws are difficult in the Champions League. “We have to have belief in ourselves when that game comes round. We are going to have to try to beat these sort of teams if we want to win the Champions League, so it is what it is. “I’m saying any draw would be tough. I just think if you look, they are top of La Liga. “I watched them knock Liverpool out last year, who are obviously a great team and they have that experience and quality in their squad. “So I think most people would say they were certainly one of the toughest teams we could’ve got on paper. “We’ll just have to turn up and do our job and be confident we can beat them.”

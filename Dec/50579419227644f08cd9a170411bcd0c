Tottenham boss, Jose Mourinho, has reacted after midfielder, Dele Alli, angrily left the bench during their Europa League game against Antwerp on Thursday. Mourinho admitted that the England midfielder is “not a happy player.” Spurs defeated Antwerp 2-0 to secured the top spot in Group J with the goals coming from Carlos Vinicius and Giovani Lo Celso. But it was another frustrating night for Alli on the sidelines as Mourinho snubbed him despite making full use of the five substitutions rule over the course of the match. The cameras captured Alli storming down the tunnel after the Portuguese made his final change, but he did return a short while later, with Mourinho ultimately unconcerned. “Let’s not run away from reality,” the former Manchester United boss told reporters. “A player on the bench who realises all five subs have been used of course is not a happy player and I would not expect him to be happy.”

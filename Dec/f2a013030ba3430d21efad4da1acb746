The Oyo State House of Assembly has commenced the amendment of the law that guides the establishment of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) Ogbomoso. DAILY POST recalls that the institution which was established by the Old Oyo State government is jointly owned by both Oyo and Osun State governments. The institution has, however, been ceded to the Oyo State government following an agreement between both states. Following the agreement, the Oyo State House of Assembly commenced the process of amending the law that established the institution. Members of the State Assembly present at the plenary on Thursday passed the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso Bill, 2020, through second reading. Our correspondent reports that this was sequel to a letter forwarded to the House by Governor Seyi Makinde on the need for the State Legislature to enact a new bill that will make provision for the sole ownership of the State University. The new law to be enacted is meant to repeal the LAUTECH Law contained in Cap 67, Laws of Oyo State 2000. Some of the provisions of the new bill include that the Oyo State Governor shall be the visitor of the University, that the University shall establish other campuses or colleges in other towns or cities in the state and that the University shall have a council which shall consist of Principal officers. It will also lead to the revocation of joint ownership of the University. Speaker of Oyo State House of Assembly, Honourable Adebo Ogundoyin in his remarks, lauded the State Governor, Engineer Seyi Makinde for forwarding the bill to the Legislature. Ogundoyin noted that the bill will give necessary legal backing to the new status of the institution. The House thereafter referred the bill to its Committee on Education for further scrutiny and deliberations.

A petitioner on Monday before the Enugu State Police Brutality and Extra-Judicial Panel, Miss Uzoamaka Ugwuoke, says she has not seen her brother, Nnaemeka Ugwuoke, since he was arrested in 2017. Ugwuoke told the panel on Monday in Enugu that her brother was arrested by men of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) on Jan. 12, 2017 and had not been seen since then. Ugwuoke, a native of Iheaka in Igboeze South Local Government Area of the state, said that his brother was taken to the SARS office in Enugu after the arrest. She said that her brother was arrested alongside three other persons, adding that while one person was released after two weeks, the other person was released after six months. “We made several attempts for the release of my brother to no avail. The last time we went to SARS office was in 2018. We do not know whether he is still alive,” she said. Ugwuoke said that one Anthony Obi, who was handling the matter, had threatened to kill her brother if they reported the matter to a lawyer. “At some point, my life was at risk due to threats from Obi and one Alex who was the SARS commander,” Ugwuoke said. Responding, the chairman of the panel, Justice Kingsley Udeh Rtd., told Ugwuoke to furnish the secretary of the panel with details of the police officers involved so as to invite them.

Minister of Women Affairs, Dame Pauline Tallen has tested positive for COVID-19. She disclosed this in a statement made available on Sunday even as she told Nigerians to keep her in their prayers. Part of the statement read: “Following interaction with individuals that later showed asymptomatic sign of COVID-19, I was advised by my medical team to undergo the test and self isolate for observation over the past few days. “After undergoing the test, my result returned positive while that of members of my family tested negative.” The minister, however, disclosed that she is asymptomatic and has gone into isolation. “Currently, I am asymptomatic and have gone into isolation during the period of treatment. Please keep me in your prayers and I implore you all to stay safe and observe all COVID-19 protocols as we grapple with this pandemic.”

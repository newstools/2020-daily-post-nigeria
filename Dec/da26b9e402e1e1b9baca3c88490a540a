The Police in Ogun State has apprehended five suspected cultists in Sango Ota area of the state. The men were arrested on Monday while conveying the lifeless body of a man suspected to be a member of their cult group in a tricycle. Police identified the suspects as Babatunde Shittu, 25; Ayobami Morenikeji, 15; Fidelis John, 23; Abdullah Adegbenro, 17 and Oyeyemi Bakare, 20. Abimbola Oyeyemi, the Ogun Police Spokesman, said in a statement on Tuesday that there was a distress call received at the Sango Area Command headquarters, where the boys were seen with a male corpse in a tricycle along Ota road and all of them in possession of dangerous weapons like cutlasses, cudgels, sticks and others. Following the call, the area Commander of Sango Ota, ACP Monday Agbonnika, was said to have mobilised a patrol team to the area. Oyeyemi informed that “the hoodlums were met on a rampage destroying people’s property.” According to him, they were also “stealing from members of the public” on Ilo-Awela road. They were reported to have, before the arrival of the police, vandalised a Highlander registered as, KJA 275GD, property of one Emmanuel Adekoya. Also, they were accused of snatching an Infinix phone belonging to one Falola Olushola and a sum of N50,000 from Emmanuel Agbaje. At the scene of the incident, the police reportedly engaged the suspects and succeeded in arresting five of them. On interrogation, the suspects told the police that they were coming from a party in Mushin, Lagos State when a fight broke out between them and a rival group. In the course of the melee, they told the police that the dead person was overrun by a fast-moving vehicle and he died on the spot. “They further claimed they were taking the corpse to the families of their attackers namely; Omo Ekun, Lampad and Anko purposely for a revenge mission,” Oyeyemi told DAILY POST.

Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has said that Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, would be great for midfielder Paul Pogba because he played in the same position. Berbatov said this ahead of Man United’s Premier League derby with Manchester City this weekend. Pogba’s future at Man United remains uncertain, after his agent, Mino Raiola, claimed this week that the France international is unhappy at the club. But Berbatov believes Pogba, who had drawn the interest of Real Madrid in the past can join Zidane’s side to become the best midfielder in the world. “I’m sure a number of clubs would be interested in signing Pogba, and I have seen a lot of rumours about him linking up with Zidane at Real Madrid,” Berbatov told Betfair. “I want to see him go back to his best form because he is a great guy. Is going to Real Madrid the solution? Maybe, Zidane, his fellow countryman is there, and if he goes, it would be a fresh start for him. “As a player, you can learn something from every coach, not always good things, in the case of Zidane, I’m sure he would be great for Pogba because he played in the same position, and he was the best in that role, he can speak to him about it, and they already have that connection of both being French. “It might only be a few small things, but Zidane has been there and knows what it takes to be the best midfielder in the world, which is something that I would love Pogba to go on and be.” Berbatov added, “But, it all depends on the player and his mindset, you have to take on board everything that a coach tells you, even if it isn’t compliments, you have to listen to the criticism and how to improve, sometimes you can’t surround yourself with people that love you and tell you how good you are, the truth hurts but it can be useful.”

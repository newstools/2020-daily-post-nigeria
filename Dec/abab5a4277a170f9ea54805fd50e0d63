A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Chief Adeniyi Akintola, has declared that people who are currently in the corridor of power in Nigeria are digging the grave of the country. Akintola, who was a gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2019 in Oyo State, insisted that people who are occupying political offices in the country are digging the grave of the country at a geometrical rate by refusing to restructure Nigeria. He spoke in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital on Tuesday. Akintola, who expressed fear over the continued existence of Nigeria, however, stated that he never supported those clamouring for the break-up of the country. Akintola, who recalled previous efforts to ensure immediate restructuring of the country, added that Nigeria cannot continue without restructuring. He explained that the problem of Nigeria was a product of the system. He disagreed that the current state of hopelessness in the country was brought by the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC). “It’s not APC nor President Buhari that brought the state of hopelessness in the country. “Rather , it is you and I that brought it. It is the system that we are running here. “Sometimes, I pity those in power because the system has made it so difficult for them to achieve anything. People no longer have integrity. “I was in South Korea last time, the only religion they worship is “The Truth”. “But in Nigeria, we have the largest congregation of religions in the world. Yet, we are ungodly. So, it is not the fault of Buhari or APC”.

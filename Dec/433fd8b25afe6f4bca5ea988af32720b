Peter Obi, former Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential running mate, has reacted to the defection of Governor Dave Umahi to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Obi insisted that Umahi’s defection has no economic value to the average Nigerian. Speaking on Arise Television yesterday, Obi wondered how many lives Umahi had impacted upon economically, amid his defection. The former Anambra State governor charged Nigerians not to be distracted by Umahi’s defection. According to Obi: “How many people have been pulled out of poverty by Umahi’s defection? Will Nigeria exit recession because Umahi left PDP? “What economic value does Umahi’s defection to APC have on the average Nigerian on the street who is struggling to put food on their table? “We must not be distracted by political movements at this time. Anyone is free to belong to any political party. Our common focus should be saving our economy and making our governance fruitful and productive.” Umahi had recently defected from PDP to the APC. He had explained that his defection was due to PDP’s alleged marginalization of the Southeast.

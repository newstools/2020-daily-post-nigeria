A former governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, has said President Muhammadu Buhari needs to seek forgiveness from God because he has failed Nigerians. Lamido stated this during an interview with BBC Hausa. He lamented the killing of farmers in Borno State by Boko Haram and insisted “something is wrong somewhere”. According to him, Buhari needs to drop his arrogance. He also asked him to resign. “There is no way a government can go successfully without sabotage but you need to be strong enough to overcome such challenges. If really he cannot withstand this, he has to resign, but we can’t be accepting sabotage as a reason. “He has failed totally. If not that he has failed, how will you allow some people to slaughter 43 people? How will you allow bandits to raid villages and set them on fire and rape their women? Definitely, something is wrong somewhere. “Allah is merciful to his servants, we hope our prayers will be answered, but Buhari has to go first. He should ask himself what offenses he has committed. He needs to wake up at midnight, drop his arrogance and pray. He should ask for Allah’s forgiveness for the offenses he has committed. “He is arrogant and always speaking with pride. Many people have said it and we have seen it. Four years ago, if you had said something like this, you would have been abused but now the truth has come,” Lamido said.

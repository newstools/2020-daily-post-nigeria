Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, is looking at a January move for Real Madrid midfielder, Isco, according to Sport. It is believed that Isco will be allowed to leave the La Liga giants next month, although he does not have any concrete offers yet. Everton, Juventus, Sevilla and AC Milan are also monitoring the Spaniard’s situation. It is not known what sort of fee Real would want for a player who has only featured 10 times in all competitions so far this season. Isco’s deal runs until 2022, but Real are eager to get his £6million wages off their books. Arteta is under intensifying pressure after a six-game winless run in the Premier League. The Gunners are languishing in 15th place in the Premier League table, after drawing 1-1 at home to Southampton in midweek.

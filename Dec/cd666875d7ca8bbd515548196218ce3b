President Muhammadu Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Social Media, Lauretta Onochie, has warned Nigerians not to extend their hate for her principal to institutions in the country. Onochie stated this in a tweet on Wednesday. “If you choose to hate our President and Legislators, it’s okay but that hatred must not be extended to Nigeria and her institutions,” she wrote. Onochie, whose nomination as an Independent National Electoral Commission Commissioner (INEC) by Buhari attracted nationwide outrage, also advised Nigerians to defend their democracy like Americans are doing, despite ‘denigrating’ comments by US President Donald Trump who lost his re-election bid to Democrat Joe Biden last month. “While President Trump is denigrating America’s electoral system, Americans are fiercely defending the integrity of their electoral body, that’s patriotism. “We must stand by our institutions as they make progress towards serving us better,” Onochie added.

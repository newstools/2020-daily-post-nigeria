Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has blamed a lack of concentration for their 2-2 draw with Valencia on Saturday. The visitors took the lead through Mouctar Diakhaby’s header, before Lionel Messi levelled just before the break. Barca went in front thanks to an acrobatic finish from Ronald Araujo in the 52nd minute. But Valencia ensured they claimed a point after Maxi Gomez scored with 21 minutes left at the Camp Nou. “It was a difficult game, we turned it around but then we needed to show more concentration,” Koeman said after the match. “We had some chances but we were not focused enough in key moments. We went out to win the game in the second half but we did not create as much as we wanted to.”

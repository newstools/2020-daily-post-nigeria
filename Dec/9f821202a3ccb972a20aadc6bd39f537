Nnamdi Kanu has accused the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN, of having carried out the kidnap of the 344 students of Government Science Secondary School, in Kankara, Katsina State. The self-acclaimed IPOB leader believes the call by the US for further investigation to uncover who carried out the abduction was not necessary, alleging that the government is being run by Miyetti Allah. Recall that after the release of the schoolboys, the Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, had revealed that the Fulani apex socio-cultural organisation negotiated the release of the schoolboys. “Firstly, I thank Almighty God Chukwu Okike Abiama that the boys have been released unharmed,” Kanu wrote on Facebook. “I equally understand the US Government has demanded that the Federal Government of Nigeria investigate those behind the Katsina kidnapping of school children. “What other investigation is needed when the Governor of Katsina State and his aides have made it clear on several occasions that Miyetti Allah is the group responsible. Kanu said that Miyetti Allah is not only running the Federal Government but also has strongholds in some state governments such as Anambra, Abia, and Ebonyi. “They are also part of Willie Obiano’s cabinet in Anambra State, Okezie Ikpeazu is working with the same terrorists in Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu gave them land for free at Lopka and Dave Umahi will proudly tell you that he is happy working with Miyetti Allah in Ebonyi State,” he said. The IPOB lambasted the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami for rushing to declare IPOB a terrorist group while Fulani herdsmen are walking freely. He said Malami has “failed to do the same against a murderous Miyetti Allah because they know the game they are playing.”

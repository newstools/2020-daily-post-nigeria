President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, blamed lecturers for the eight-month long strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. Buhari, during a security meeting with the 36 governors in Abuja on Tuesday, said lecturers have failed to consider the larger challenges facing the country, which has resulted in the prolonged strike. The President said the government on its part conceded something but lecturers have refused to be considerate. “Government conceded something. The problem is that they refused to look at the problem of the whole country. The Minister of Labour is working hard at it. “It is amazing how ASUU will stay out of classrooms for so long. There’s a need for our elites to understand the challenges facing the country,” Buhari added.

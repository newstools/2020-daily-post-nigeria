Again, the House of Representatives has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to review and rejig the security architecture of the country in the wake of the recent abduction of students of Government Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State. The green chamber also urged the federal government to ensure the safe return of the students to their parents. The resolution followed a motion of urgent public importance moved by Seriki Adar from Sokoto State on Tuesday. It would be recalled that hundreds of students were reportedly abducted by bandits on Friday night at a government school in Katsina. This is not the first time the House will be calling for the restructuring of the nation’s security architecture. The house in a recent resolution invited President Buhari to brief it on the security situation in the country and to sack the Service Chiefs. The president did not yield to the two requests. Speaking on the motion, Adar said the motion is a bipartisan motion with an endorsement from lawmakers across party affiliations. “This is a bipartisan motion. we do not want what happened to the last motion to happen to this motion. We do not want any controversy.” The House also resolved that the Federal government should review the Safe School Initiative and mandated the committee on legislative compliance to ensure compliance.

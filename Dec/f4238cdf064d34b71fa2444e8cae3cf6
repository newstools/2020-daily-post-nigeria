Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has hailed Karim Benzema as the best French striker. Benzema netted a brace as Madrid beat Athletic Bilbao 3-1 on Tuesday night. Toni Kroos put Madrid ahead in the first half, but Ander Capa’s equaliser threatened to end their winning run, before Benzema scored his fifth and sixth league goals of the season. “He’s the best. Without playing a really good game today, he scored twice again. He always shows up, that’s what the great players do,” Zidane said after the game. The French coach was asked if he believed the 32-year-old deserved to be ranked ahead of players such as Raymond Kopa, Michel Platini, Jean-Pierre Papin and Thierry Henry. “For me, yes. He shows it with what he’s doing. He’s played at Real Madrid for a long time, more than 500 games. “His goals, his trophies, what he’s done, they speak for themselves. For me he’s the best, yes, it’s clear,” Zidane replied. Benzema moved to Madrid from Lyon in 2009 and has won four Champions Leagues and three LaLiga titles during his time at the Santiago Bernabeu.

Premier League clubs are considering a two-week break after a rise in COVID-19 cases, the UK Telegraph reports. The chairmen of some top-flight sides have reportedly held talks over a mid-season time-out, as concerns grow over outbreaks at Manchester City and Sheffield United. City’s Premier League game with Everton was postponed Monday night. And although the Blades’ clash with Burnley went ahead Tuesday evening, there are fears more matches will be called off in the coming weeks. The Premier League recorded 18 positive results in its latest round of coronavirus testing. Southampton manager, Ralph Hassenhuttl, is in isolation and will not be on the bench for his side’s match against West Ham. Clubs fear there next week’s FA Cup third round will see more postponements, causing potential fixture chaos.

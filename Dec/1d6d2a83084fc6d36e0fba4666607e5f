Manchester United have offered defender, Timothy Fosu-Mensah, a new three-and-a-half-year contract ahead of their Premier League tie with Aston Villa on Friday, Sky Sports reports. Fosu-Mensah is considering his options amid interest from clubs abroad ahead of the January transfer window. The 22-year-old had drawn the interest of Marseille and Hertha Berlin. Fosu-Mensah could explore offers from elsewhere when he is free to speak to foreign clubs in January, before deciding on his future at Man United. His current deal at Man United will expire next summer. The Netherlands international wants regular first-team football, which he hasnâ€™t been getting under Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Old Trafford. He has only featured once in the Premier League this season, against Crystal Palace and two more as a sub in the Champions League. Fosu-Mensah has been loaned out in the past to Fulham and Crystal Palace respectively.

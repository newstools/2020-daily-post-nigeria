Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said he cannot question the fight and energy of his players after a 2-1 defeat to Everton on Saturday, but admits he “understood” his position might become untenable if results fail to improve. The Gunners slumped to their eighth defeat in 14 Premier League games this season at Goodison Park. Yerry Mina’s header proved to be the winner, after Nicolas Pepe’s penalty cancelled out an own goal from Rob Holding. The result leaves Arsenal hovering just above the relegation zone in 15th place. When put to him that his position may become ‘untenable’, the Spaniard replied: “I understand that. My energy and my focus is only on getting the team out of that situation, maintaining the spirit of the team. “The fight that the boys show every time they go on the pitch and the energy the boys show on the pitch. You can see that, you cannot deny that. “Obviously we are against the results, it’s not good enough. It is not good enough for the standards of this football club and this is the challenge. And the fact that we are against.”

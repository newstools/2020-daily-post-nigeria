The Border Communities Development Agency (BCDA) has declared that no illegitimate payments were made into private accounts of individuals in the agency. BCDA said, contrary to insinuations, the agency only made legitimate payments to staff members aimed at carrying out official duties. Sadiq Isa, BCDA Head of Public Affairs and Protocol made the clarification in a statement he signed. Isa said that if there were to be anything untoward in the payments they would not be on the federal government Treasury Open Payment Platform. He said on the specific issue of payment to staff for Duty Tour Allowance (DTA) and conferences the payments were made in 2019 and have been verified, authenticated and audited by Federal Government Agencies responsible for routine and yearly auditing at the end of the 2019 Financial Year. “That the payments were for a whole range of activities- not less than 25 programmes- among which were trainings, conferences, projects inspection, visitations, consultancy payments, project handing-over, community engagement and sensitization in 21 states of the Federation were conveniently ignored.” “It is on record that since the assumption of office by the Executive Secretary, Captain Junaid Abdullahi, in 2018, the Agency has witnessed tremendous achievements with the execution and handing over of 1,031 projects across different border communities in 21 Border States of the country. These projects are both in the social and economic sector which have a positive impact on the lives and livelihoods of Nigerians living at the border communities. “Also there are 457 projects currently ongoing in the 2020 financial year. “These projects cut across areas such as: Agriculture, Education, Health, Clean Water and Sanitation, Electrification, Commerce, Access Roads and Bridges, Housing and Human Capital Development.”

The Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi has allegedly ordered the immediate confiscation of over a hundred drums of arms and ammunition re[ortedly smuggled into the state’s building materials market. Umahi had on a tipoff, stormed the building material market located at the popular Afikpo road beside Akanu-Ibiam flyover junction. Although, the governor at his arrival to the market told newsmen to leave the venue as he went into a closed-door meeting with the executives of the market. It was gathered that a combined team of security agencies had in the early hours of Thursday cordoned and ransacked the whole building materials market. An eyewitness who spoke to journalists in Abakaliki said the purported arms and ammunition were allegedly bound for other neighbouring states but was smuggled into Ebonyi building material market. “it’s true. Arms loaded with goods bound for Yola, Adamawa States were smuggled into the area” the source noted. Another source, a top security officer who confided in DAILY POST said it is not arms but live ammunition that were loaded alongside other goods in a truck and offloaded at the building material market. “A truck was loaded with ammunition together with other goods, and it was smuggled into the building material market one week ago. The police and army were alerted about the development. “The owner of the truck could not provide the receipt of the goods while trying to leave the building material market and the executives of the market insisted that he must provide it and it resulted in suspicion. DAILY POST gathered that the truck, at the time of filing this report has been seized by the security agents for further investigation. When contacted for confirmation, the Ebonyi State Police Public Relations Officer, Loveth Odah, said she was in a lecture hall and could not speak on the matter.

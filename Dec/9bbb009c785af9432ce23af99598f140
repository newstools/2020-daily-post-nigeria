The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, on Sunday, revealed what God said President Muhammadu Buhari should do. According to Primate Ayodele God said Buhari should pray for his health and life. Addressing his members in his church in Lagos, the clergyman also urged the president to pray against death in the State House. A statement he forwarded to DAILY POST, Ayodele said: ‘Buhari needs pray for his health and life, Prayers needs to be made in the Villa against the death of anyone there, these are what the Lord has shown me.” Recall that Primate Ayodele had in May urged Buhari to pray against losing his aides. Ayodele had issued the advice following the death of Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari and appointment of Ibrahim Gambari as a replacement. The popular prophet also encouraged Gambari to be prayerful. Ayodele called for prayers so as to avert another death in the Presidential Villa.

Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has singled out Billy Gilmour and Tino Anjorin for praise following his side’s Champions League 1-1 draw with Krasnodar on Tuesday night. Lampard said both Gilmour and Anjorin did really good against Krasnodar at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea and Krasnodar played draw following goals from Jorginho and Remy Cabella. “Billy Gilmour was really good on his return, and Tino Anjorin was really good making his full debut in the Champions League,” Lampard said as quoted by Chelsea’s official website after the game. “There were no injuries, we got the work in the legs for people that needed it and also the ones that come off the bench because we’ll be needing them this week so I am very pleased. “We wanted to win, but it was a tough game to navigate. I asked the lads to be professional and get their attitude right, and they all certainly did that.” Chelsea’s next game is against Everton in the Premier League on Saturday. —

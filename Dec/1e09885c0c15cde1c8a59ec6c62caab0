Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike, says he will re-impose lockdown beginning from January as the number of coronavirus cases surge in the state. Wike gave hint of imminent second phase of lockdown amid rising cases of COVID-19 during the thanksgiving church service in celebration of the 90th birthday of Mrs. Priscilla Nwanediye Mark, at the St. Martin’s Anglican Church, Omagwa in Ikwerre Local Government on Sunday. He lamented as worrisome the refusal of most churches and markets in the State to enforce compulsory wearing of face masks in adherence to COVID-19 protocol. Wike said the State government had initially relaxed the restriction on the number of persons who worship in churches, but with the second wave of COVID-19, he will by this week announce new stringent measures to check the spread of COVID-19 cases in the State. “When you go to some churches, they don’t wear masks. Go to the market, they don’t wear masks. They believe COVID is not real. It’s not real because it has not happened to you; nobody has died whom you know. When somebody has died and the person was close to you, you will know that COVID is real. “So, it is real and I want to appeal to all of you that we have to be stricter now because the second wave is more dangerous than the first wave. It’s very, very dangerous. I know how many people we have lost since the second wave started,” he said.

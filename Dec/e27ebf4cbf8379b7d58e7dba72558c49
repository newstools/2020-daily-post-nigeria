Kanu, also known as Papilo, had in his reaction to Osaze’s ranting, reminded the player that he would always choose his family before anything else. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-857647 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201204-130658_Chrome-498x1024.jpg" alt="" width="498" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201204-130658_Chrome-498x1024.jpg 498w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201204-130658_Chrome-146x300.jpg 146w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201204-130658_Chrome.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 498px) 100vw, 498px">

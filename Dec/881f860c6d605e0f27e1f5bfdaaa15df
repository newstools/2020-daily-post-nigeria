Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries has refuted reports that he collected COVID-19 loan from the United States, US, government. A Twitter user by the name Michael Harriot had published churches and their pastors who allegedly collected COVID-19 loan from the US government. Harriot had alleged that Apostle Suleman collected $188, 252 from the US government. Reacting to the report, Apostle Suleman denied collecting such loan. The clergyman claimed that his name have been used to scam the US government. In a series of tweets, the clergyman wrote: “To see that people are commenting is so pedestrian, lol. I never collect loan for Africa, na America? “I have instructed our National pastor in America investigate it. “Just seeing this online, no dime in kobo got to me. If someone scammed you then that’s your business. Get my name out of this rubbish or you will explain.”

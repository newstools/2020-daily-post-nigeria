Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has urged Nigerian leaders and citizens to suppress 2023 talks, post-Buhari politics and concentrate on fixing Nigeria. Saraki, in his New Year message, congratulated Nigerians, at home and abroad, who survived the various difficulties experienced in 2020. The former Kwara Governor prayed to God to give fortitude and strength to those who lost their loved ones to coronavirus, terrorists, kidnappers and other criminals. Saraki also extended condolence to families of security agents who died in active service as well as deceased health and emergency workers. He advised officials and citizens to generate ideas towards solving insecurity, economic recession, dearth of infrastructure, collapse of national values, threat to national unity, lack of social welfare and youth restiveness. “We should find solutions. We should build conversations on what needs to be done to ensure that our security agencies can work together and have the necessary facilities to eliminate insurgency, kidnapping, robbery and harassment of innocent citizens and foreigners engaged in genuine businesses. “Both leaders and followers should focus on how we can get the economy working, produce youths who can take advantage of new technology and become key players in the communication technology world, attract foreign direct investments, diversify the economy and make the country more relevant and important in the comity of nations. “Our focus now should be how to ensure that our youths are gainfully engaged and that we create avenues to appropriate their modern ideas, energy and creativity for the purpose of national development. We should be talking about how to ensure that our education and health systems become revived and able to serve the interest of all.” Saraki beseeched God to heal Nigeria, protect everyone, and restore the unity and prosperity of the country.

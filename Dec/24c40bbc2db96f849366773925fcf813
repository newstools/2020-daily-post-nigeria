Self-employed people and gig workers will also receive further assistance. The bill provides $25billion to help families pay their rent; it extends the current eviction moratorium until January 31. It allocates $13billion for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. The sum of $284billion Paycheck Protection Program loans has been earmarked for small business, nonprofits and local newspapers, TV and radio stations.

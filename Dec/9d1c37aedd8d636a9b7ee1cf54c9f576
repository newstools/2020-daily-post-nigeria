Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has lamented the high scale of corruption in the Imo State Civil Service which he said had nearly destroyed all apparatus of government in the state. Governor Uzodinma spoke at a Catholic Mass in Omuma, his country home in Oru East local government area and contained in a press statement. Explaining that he had sought the face of God before contesting for governor, Uzodimma disclosed that the problem of Imo State is more with the Civil Service system rather than politicians. “Contrary to popular perception, I discovered that the problem of Imo State is more with the Civil Service system than the politicians. Massive corruption was the order of the day in the Imo State Civil Service when I assumed office and it wasn’t healthy for us as a state. “Though my predecessor, Emeka Ihedioha’s administration, noticed the anomalies plaguing the system and tried to do some verification, their efforts yielded little results then, until our administration came on board and embarked on full automation of the payment system of the State. The Governor disclosed that his administration has paid 43,000 workers and 21,000 pensioners in the state relying on the automation of the payment and financial systems. He alleged that those who have not been paid are those who have issues with accurate bio-data or those receiving double salaries or pensions and were queried by the automation system. “I challenge those claiming to be owed to approach the data centre with their pension identification number and other relevant details so that their status will be revealed and payment effected if they do not have issues.

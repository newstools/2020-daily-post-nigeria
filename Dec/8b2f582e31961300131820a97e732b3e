Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma has urged Nigerians to observe all COVID-19 safety protocols as they celebrate the birth of Christ. Uzodimma gave the advice on Friday in Owerri in his Christmas message to Imo people. He urged them to pray for the healing of Nigerians who had contracted the virus. Governor Uzodimma advised Imo residents to recommit themselves to making the state better while ensuring that the “flame of the divine light that Christ symbolises remains aglow’’. He advised Christians not to lose sight of the reason for the festivity, which is God’s love for mankind and urged them to shun hatred and divisive acts. “Jesus Christ heralds a new awakening and Christians should exploit the opportunity of this season to recommit themselves to making the society better and ensuring that the flame of this divine light is not extinguished. “Jesus Christ did not only come to illuminate the world but remains the undisputed light of the world, the reason he is worshipped, adored and glorified.”NAN quoted him as saying.

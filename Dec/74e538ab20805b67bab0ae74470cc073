The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has shortlisted 920 candidates who scaled through its 2020 airmen/airwomen recruitment test for enlistment. It also advised all successful candidates to resume training at the Nigerian Air Force Base, Kawo, in Kaduna State on Tuesday, December 8, 2020. NAF disclosed this in a post via its Twitter handle. Twenty-five successful candidates were drawn from each state of the federation. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) was, however, allotted the least slot with 20 shortlisted names. NAF informed the candidates to bring items such as original credentials, two pairs of blue PT shorts, two white T-Shirts, three pairs of white socks and one pair of white canvas shoes. Others are two white shirts, one black tie, three sets of national dress and two pairs of black trousers, two reusable face masks in compliance with COVID-19 safety protocols and a 100ml hand sanitizer. airforce recrut 2 <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-857786" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/naf.jpg" alt="" width="581" height="444" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/naf.jpg 581w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/naf-300x229.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px">

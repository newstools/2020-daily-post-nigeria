Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State confirmed that two people died following on attack on the Garkida area of the state by Boko Haram insurgents. The governor, in a statement released Friday evening, condemned the attack on Garkida town in Gombi Local Government Area, saying it was a dastardly act against innocent people. A statement signed by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri’s Press Secretary said, Humwashi Wonosikou, “This latest cowardly attack is yet another desperate rear guard action by the Boko Haram terrorists who have been under intense pressure from the Nigerian military.” Boko Haram insurgents had stormed Garkida Thursday evening, carting away valuables and destroying some other valuables that they could not be moved out. Condemning the attack further, Governor Fintiri said, “Let me reassure Adamawa residents that this latest cowardly attack on Garkida would not go without severe consequences.” Fintiri sympathised with residents of Garkida over the attack, saying, “This is a cruel reminder of the indiscriminate aims of the terrorists and an example of why everyone must be involved to confront a menace without boundaries. “I stand with Garkida community in this difficult time, and will continue to support the military efforts to ensure peace, security and justice for the people.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-860539" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG-20201225-WA0016.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="810" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG-20201225-WA0016.jpg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG-20201225-WA0016-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG-20201225-WA0016-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-860540" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG-20201225-WA0023.jpg" alt="" width="810" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG-20201225-WA0023.jpg 810w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG-20201225-WA0023-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG-20201225-WA0023-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px">

Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie has revealed why an average Nigerian youth can never run for Presidency, Governorship and Senatorial elections. The actor made this known via his Twitter account on Tuesday while addressing an issue about Nigerian politics and the way the Nigerian youths react to youth’s place in governance. According to him, Nigerian youths do not believe in themselves and are always quick to express doubt in everything. “Tell the average Nigerian youth you want to run for Senate, Governor or President. “He will laugh & tell you to go start from House of Assembly and this is our major problem. “We don’t even believe in ourselves. I need you all to Know this: there’re no impossibilities in life. What you focus on grows,” he said. Recall that the actor had contested for the position of the Anambra State Governor in the last election but lost.

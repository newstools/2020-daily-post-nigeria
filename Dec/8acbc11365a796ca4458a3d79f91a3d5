Mohammed Adamu, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), on Thursday, directed immediate investigations into a suit reportedly challenging the legality of the States’ Judicial Panel of Inquiry, investigating allegations by Nigerians against officers of the defunct SARS. Adamu gave the order in a series of tweets via the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) Twitter handle. DAILY POST recalls that this is coming less than 24 hours after the NPF filed a suit through their lawyer, Mr. O. M. Atoyebi at the Federal High Court in Abuja, saying that the state governments lacked the power to set up panels to investigate activities of the police force. “The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu, NPM, mni has directed immediate investigations into a suit purportedly challenging the legality of the States’ Judicial Panel of Inquiry, investigating allegations by citizens against officers of the defunct SARS. “The IGP, who gave the order on the heels of trending reports in the media, today, expressed the disapproval of the Force Management Team on the matter and ordered investigations into the alleged role of the Force Legal Section including its Head,” NPF tweeted.

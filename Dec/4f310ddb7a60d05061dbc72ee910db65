The Oyo State House of Assembly has passed the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Ogbomoso Bill, 2020 into Law. DAILY POST reports that the bill was passed into law on Monday by the State lawmakers. Our correspondent recalls that the Assembly had last week commenced the amendment of the law that guides the establishment of the institution. The amendment, DAILY POST gathered, was necessary due to the ceding of the institution to Oyo State. The institution, which was jointly owned by both Oyo and Osun States, was last month ceded to Oyo State government. The Assembly passed the amended bill of the institution on Monday after Clause by Clause consideration by the Lawmakers. The new law has repealed the LAUTECH Law contained in Cap 67, Laws of Oyo State. DAILY POST gathered that with the passage of the bill, provision has now been made for the sole ownership of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, LAUTECH Ogbomoso by Oyo State. Some other provisions of the new bill include that the Oyo State Governor is now the visitor to the University. The new law states that the University shall establish other campusess or colleges in other towns or cities in the State. The law also said that the University shall have a Council which shall consist of Principal officers.

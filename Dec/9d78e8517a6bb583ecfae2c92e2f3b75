A car wash expert, Idris Ayotunde, has been arrested in Ogun State with a car he allegedly stole from one of his customers. Ayotunde, the police said, was nabbed on Friday with the maroon-coloured Ford car, with registration number EPE 707 FM, “which he stole from his customer in Lagos.” DAILY POST gathered that the suspect was arrested at Alakija village via Olodo area of Ogun State at about 8:17am by the safer highway patrol team, who were on stop-and-search duty along Abeokuta/Ibadan highway. Confirming the report to DAILY POST on Sunday, the Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi said “the team stopped the car and demanded for its documents which the suspect was unable to produce, consequent upon which, he was taken to Odeda divisional headquarters where he was interrogated by the DPO, CSP Ajayi Williams.” It was at this point that the DPO found out that the suspect actually stole the car, Oyeyemi disclosed. “The suspect, who claimed to be an OND holder from a polytechnic in one of the South Western states, explained that he joined a car wash situated at Jimoh bus stop, Shasha Akowonjo in Lagos State, not up to one month. “He stated further that the owner of the car brought it for vacuum cleaning and handed over the key to him. Since they don’t have vacuum engine in their own car wash, he decided to take it to another car wash nearby but he changed his mind on the road and bolted away with the car,” the police hinted. According to Oyeyemi, the suspect was on his way to Ibadan where he intended to dispose of the car, but he was accosted by the policemen and subsequently arrested. Meanwhile, the owner of the car, one Mrs. Shofidiya Tosin, has been contacted and equally confirmed that the car was stolen from her.

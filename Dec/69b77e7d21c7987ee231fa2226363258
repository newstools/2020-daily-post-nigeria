The United States has removed all visa reciprocity fees for Nigerians with effect from December 3. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirmed this on Saturday. A statement from the ministry confirmed that the development follows the Nigerian government’s decision to remove “excess visa application, processing and biometric fees for United States citizens applying for Nigerian visas”. The reciprocity fee was imposed by the Donald Trump administration in 2019 and was between $80 to $303 depending on the type of visa. The fee was charged alongside the mandatory visa application fees for only applicants who are issued visas. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-857782" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FOREIGN-AFFAIRS.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="1569" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FOREIGN-AFFAIRS.jpg 1242w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FOREIGN-AFFAIRS-237x300.jpg 237w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FOREIGN-AFFAIRS-811x1024.jpg 811w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FOREIGN-AFFAIRS-1216x1536.jpg 1216w" sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px">

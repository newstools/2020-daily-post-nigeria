Primate Elijah Ayodele, leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari over the issue of insecurity in the country. Ayodele disclosed that God told him that there would be confusion and disorderliness in Nigeria if Buhari fails to sack his Service Chiefs by February. The clergyman disclosed this in response to the abduction of students of Government Science Secondary School, GSS, in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State. Primate Ayodele in a statement he forwarded to DAILY POST, on Sunday, lamented that Buhari was running Nigeria like he has no direction. He said: “Unfortunately, President Buhari is running the country like he has no direction, look at how they kidnapped students in his hometown yet he has refused to remove the service chiefs and replace them with people that can act. “I want to Say what the Lord said, I have said it before, If Buhari doesn’t change the service chiefs before February, there will be disorderliness and confusion in the country. “Actually, there are lot of confusion in his government now and there are lot of internal trouble” in both the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The popular cleric said the confusion would lead Nigeria to “unforeseen anarchy and total disorderliness because this insecurity will affect the rich and the poor.” He further warned that the anarchy and disorderliness may lead to “another protest that will cause the country to shut down.’’

Aston Villa vs Newcastle United on Friday is looking likely to be postponed due to a COVID-19 outbreak at the club, according to Sky Sports. Newcastle is in discussion with the Premier League over the potential postponement of the match after their squad was ordered to stay away from their training ground. Over the weekend it emerged that three individuals within the first-team bubble had tested positive for Coronavirus and after further testing on Sunday, more players also returned positive tests. Newcastle has been unwilling to disclose the exact numbers or identities of those affected. The clubâ€™s training ground has been closed since the weekend and players have not trained since last Thursday. Another round of testing is due to take place on Wednesday.

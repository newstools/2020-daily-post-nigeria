One of Zazzau Emirate Kingmakers, Muhammad Aliyu (Limamin Kona), on Thursday, secured an interim order against Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, and the state government. Aliyu prayed the Kaduna State High Court in Dogarawa, Zaria, to stop El-Rufai and the government from harassing him and his colleagues. They are Ibrahim Aminu (Waziri Zazzau), Umar Muhammad (Fagacin Zazzau), Muhammad Abbas (Makama Ƙarami), and Dalhatu Ƙasimu (Limamin Juma’a). El-Rufai had set-up an investigation committee on the “conduct and misconduct” of some kingmakers and council members. Ibrahim Hussaini, Commissioner for Environment, is the Chairman; Murtala Halidu is the Secretary. In his ruling, Justice Kabir Dabo directed the committee to suspend all proceedings, sittings and deliberations. The order will be in effect pending the hearing on motion on notice slated for December 16, 2020. Balarabe Abbas, Secretary to the State Government, and the Attorney General, Aisha Dikko, are expected to stay all actions. After a selection process for the Emir of Zazzau in September, the kingmakers submitted three names to the state government. They princes are Aminu (Iyan Zazzau), Aminu Shehu Idris (Turakin Zazzau), and Muhammadu Munir Ja’afaru (Yariman Zazzau). But after weeks of delay, El-Rufai named Ahmed Bamalli as the Emir to the chagrin of many. Bamalli, an ally of the governor and dethroned Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido, is former Nigerian Ambassador to Thailand. Those following the matter insist that the kingmakers’ seeming refusal to support him pitched them against the authorities, and could the reason a panel was raised to probe them. The Iyan, who was number on the list submitted to the government, has vowed to fight Bamalli’s installation with all legal means. Justice Dabo is also presiding over his case against El-Rufai, Kaduna government, the Emir, and others. The pre-trial hearing in the suit will come up on Friday. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-858520 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="723" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-1.jpg 512w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-1-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-858521 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-2.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="766" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-2.jpg 512w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-2-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-858522 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-3.jpg" alt="" width="512" height="748" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-3.jpg 512w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-3-205x300.jpg 205w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px">

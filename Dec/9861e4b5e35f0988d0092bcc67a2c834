The Imo State Police Command has arrested two indigenes of Mbaitoli LGA for allegedly planting a human head in a water tank in a bid to frustrate a kinsman whom they had a land dispute with. The police spokesman, Orlando Ikeokwu, gave the names of the suspects as Onumajuru Godwin, 61 and Agubosim Chukwuemeka, 41, both from Eziama Obiato in Mbaitoli LGA of the state. According to Ikeokwu, the suspects had reported to the police divisional headquarters alleging that one Emmanuel Onuwa had murdered an unidentified person and hidden his skull in his water tank. Ikeokwu disclosed that the police arrested Onuwa and his children on the strength of the report made by the suspects. According to the police spokesman, the suspects were arrested on a tip-off and paraded at the command. Ikeokwu further said that the action of the suspects was to ensure Onuwa was kept out of circulation for them to have unhindered access to the land. He informed that both Onumajuru and Chukwuemeka have confessed to the crime but claimed they got the human head from a corpse at Njaba River. He promised that efforts were on top gear to unravel the identity of the corpse.

Mr Governor relies on all of us for him to succeed. That responsibility now lies more on his appointees to help him bring his vision into fruition. You must all work in one accord so that his government will continue to record greater successes. “On our part as the Legislative Arm, we have and shall continue to demonstrate sufficient goodwill to Mr Governor and give him all the necessary support he needs to finish strong. We are not in any way ready to relent on that. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-858110" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1607366601062.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="477" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1607366601062.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1607366601062-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> Continuing, the Speaker added, “the House under my leadership shall therefore not hesitate to keep making the necessary laws, and oversight on all appointees to ensure the people get value for the confidence they have reposed in our dear Governor. His success is also our collective success. Let everyone do their part.”

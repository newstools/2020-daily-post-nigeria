The National Economic Council (NEC) has given a condition for Nigeria to go back to lockdown again in the wake of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic. NEC said Nigeria would have to resort to the last aspect of going back to lockdown again if Nigerians don’t take proper measures with very strict observation of the protocols that were laid on COVID-19. The council expressed worries and advised that sanitation restrictions on the number of people in gatherings among other protocols should be taken seriously. Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State, briefed State House correspondents after a virtual NEC meeting presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Thursday, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. “It was resolved that proper measures should be taken again with very strict observation of the protocols and observation of some of the conditions that were laid, otherwise, we are going to move into a situation where it will be very uncontrollable. “And for that, states were advised to go back and emphasize the implementation or the enforcement of some of the protocols that we have earlier started in the first phase. “Otherwise, we have to resort to the last aspect, of course, everybody knows, going back to lockdown again, which is not anybody’s doing. “But then let’s all go back and observe most of the protocols that we have to curtail the further spread of COVID-19,’’ he said. The Federal Government had warned that Nigeria was witnessing a second wave of COVID-19 going by the latest records.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has said that those it described as ‘Naysayers’ have leant their lessons following the release of the 344 Kankara schoolboys. Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, addressed the press on Friday in reaction to release of the 344 schoolboys. The Minister congratulated the parents and guardians of the schoolboys, who, according to him, will soon reunite with their children and wards. Mohammed noted that the kidnap of the Kankara boys marked the second of its kind under the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. The Minister noted that Just like the Kankara schoolboys, all but one of the kidnapped schoolgirls from Dapchi, Leah Sharibu, were rescued unharmed. Lai Mohammed also recalled that in 2014, 276 schoolgirls were abducted by terrorists in Chibok, Borno State, adding that the Buhari administration had been able to rescue over 100. “Each time this has happened, we have always accepted responsibility, rather than being in denial. “We will not relent until all those who remain missing in Chibok and Dapchi and reunited with their families. “The reactions in certain quarters to the Kankara incident was shameful. Some Nigerians went as far as denigrating their government and country in the most uncouth and irresponsible manner. “They simply threw decorum to the wind and allowed their emotions to take a better part of them. We hope the naysayers have learnt their lessons. “And we hope those who have started trading and politicking with the hashtag ‘BringBackOurBoys’ can now go home…”

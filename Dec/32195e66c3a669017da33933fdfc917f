Manchester United have defended striker, Edinson Cavani, after he received a three-game ban for using the word “negrito” in an Instagram post. The Red Devils insisted that Cavani is “not a racist”. Cavani was on Thursday fined £100,000 and banned for three games by the FA. The Uruguay star reposted an Instagram story, which featured a racially offensive term, following Man United’s 3-2 win at Southampton on November 29. The former PSG forward was found guilty of breaking FA Rule E3 and must also complete face-to-face education after admitting a charge. The 33-year-old will now miss Man United’s games against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Watford. The post was deleted, and Cavani apologised. Reacting, Man United, in a statement on Thursday, said, “As he has stated, Edinson Cavani wasn’t aware that his words could have been misconstrued and he sincerely apologised for the post and to anyone who was offended. “Despite his honest belief that he was simply sending an affectionate thank-you in response to a congratulatory message from a close friend, he chose not to contest the charge, out of respect for, and solidarity with, the FA and the fight against racism in football. Edinson Cavani’s response to a friend on Instagram used the word ‘negrito’ (Instagram) “While it is clear that context and intent are key factors, we note that the independent Regulatory Commission was required to impose a minimum three-game suspension. “The club trusts that the independent Regulatory Commission will make it clear in its written reasons that Edinson Cavani is not a racist, nor was there any racist intent in relation to his post.”

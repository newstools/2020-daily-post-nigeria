The Imo State Police Command, on Friday, deployed 3,500 police officers across the state to maintain security during the Yuletide. The Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede, disclosed this on Friday, while parading one Uche Uyana, arrested for allegedly committing murder. He was paraded along with 13 other suspects arrested in connection with armed robbery, kidnapping and cultism. Akinmoyede said that criminal elements would no more have a field day during the Christmas and New Year celebrations, with the existence of ‘Sting Operation’. The Commissioner of Police said the command had braced up to security activities in the state despite the setback caused by the End SARS protest. He assured the general public that the era of criminality in the state was over and advised criminals to quit from criminality.

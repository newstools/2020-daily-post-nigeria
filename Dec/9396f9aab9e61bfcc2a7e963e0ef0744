The West African Examinations Council, WAEC, has disclosed that students involved in examination malpractices would be barred from taking the West African Senior School Certificate Examination, SSCE, henceforth. This was made public by WAEC’s Examination Committee after its 70th Meeting, on Monday. A statement by the committee also vowed to blacklist supervisors involved in malpractices. The committee, which is the highest decision-making organ of the council, said those affected would be banned for some years. The committee also threatened to sanction schools involved in examination malpractice. “In addition, some candidates will also suffer other sanctions such as barring them from sitting for the Council’s examination for a certain number of years, some schools will be derecognised for a specified number of years or have their recognition completely withdrawn, some supervisors that were found wanting in the discharge of their examination duties will be formally reported to their employers and blacklisted,” the statement reads partly.

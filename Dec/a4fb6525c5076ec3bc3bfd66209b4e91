Margaret Keenan, a grandmother who turns 91 next week, and 81-year-old William Shakespeare were the first and second persons to be injected the COVID-9 vaccine in the UK on Tuesday. The two were the first persons in the world to receive the approved vaccine backed by robust clinical trials. They marked the start of the UK’s national mass vaccination campaign. Shakespeare and Keeman received their vaccination early Tuesday morning at the University Hospital in Coventry. “I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19,” Keenan said, according to the UK’s National Health Service. “It’s the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year.” The United Kingdom purchased 40 million doses of the two-dose vaccine, which is expected to go towards inoculating 20 million people through 2021.

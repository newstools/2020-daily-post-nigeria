Arsenal must sort out Mesut Ozil’s situation at the club, before they can turn their attention to a January move for Christian Eriksen, according to Gazzetta Dello Sport. Ozil has been frozen out under Mikel Arteta at the Emirates Stadium. The German has six months remaining on his £350,000-a-week deal and while the Gunners are interested in Eriksen, a move will not be feasible without a resolution for their Ozil ‘problem’. Arsenal has made a poor start to the Premier League season and is currently in 13th position. Ozil is eligible to be added to Arteta’s squad from January. But it is a decision that has reportedly divided the dressing room. Eriksen only joined Inter back in January, but has struggled to make any real impact on Antonio Conte’s side and is set to leave the Serie A club next year.

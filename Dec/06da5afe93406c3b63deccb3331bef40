Angry mob on Thursday set ablaze two suspected female kidnappers in Iwo, Osun State. DAILY POST gathered that the three suspects were caught, one male and two females, after kidnapping a child and that the women were apprehended while the man escaped. In a video obtained by our reporter, the mob beat a lady to death while smashing the other with plank before they were set on fire. It was gathered that the suspects were taken to the Palace of the Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrasheed Adewale Akanbi, for the monarch to decide their fate. A resident of Iwo, who preferred anonymity said; “when the two women were apprehended by the people, they were taken to the palace but the traditional ruler told the people that brought the suspects to take them away.” But the palace spokesman, Ibrahim Ali, debunked this. Ali said Oluwo was not at the palace when the incident happened and that the crowd was expected to take the suspects to the police station, not palace. The State Commissioner of Police, CP Adie Undie, said the angry mob did not allow the policemen in the town to move near the scene. He said, ”The two women were beaten to comma and set ablaze.” The people in the area were still combing houses to fish out the third suspect.

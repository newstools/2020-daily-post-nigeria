In his lead debate, he said that “there is a need to open up the space for many to participate in the railway sector.” He added that states will generate more revenue for their Internally Generated Revenue and also create more employment opportunities for the unemployed. The bill was voted on, passed for second reading and referred to the special Ad-Hoc Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution

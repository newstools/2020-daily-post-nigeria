Paul Enenche, the Senior Pastor of Dunamis International Gospel Centre, has lamented the living condition of Nigerians. Enenche said that there was severe hunger and desperation in Nigeria. The clergyman spoke at the church’s headquarters, Glory Dome in Abuja, yesterday, when a large crowd besieged the church for Christmas welfare packages. Speaking on the welfare distribution, the trained medical doctor said: “You must watch this video clip of the food distribution today. It may make you cry too. “It depicts the level of hunger and desperation in the land that only the help of God can alleviate.” This is coming at a time the Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, had urged President Muhammadu Buhari to give the N400 billion proposed for the procurement of COVID-19 vaccines to poor Nigerians. Pastor Giwa had appealed to the Federal Government to look for ways to tackle hunger among Nigerians instead of spending such huge money on vaccines.

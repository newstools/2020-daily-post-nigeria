Former Super Eagles captain, Nwankwo Kanu, has informed former West Brom striker, Osaze Odemwingie, that he would still choose family over everything else. Kanu said this while reacting to the accusation label on his wife, Amara, by Odemwingie. Earlier, DAILY POST recalls that Osaze took to his Instagram page to warn Amara to stay away from him, accusing her of chasing him. The former Super Eagles forward, who described Kanu’s wife as ‘Delilah’, told the wife of the Arsenal legend that “it’s not our culture to message another man without your husband.” Reacting, Kanu, in a tweet on Thursday, said Odemwingie was completely wrong. Kanu tweeted, “Who is wooing who??? “Osaze, I am still going to choose family over everything else. My reaching out to you over a situation you passed through, or you reaching me can never be taken out of context as a Family. “You got this one completely wrong, my dear brother. ONE LOVE.” Meanwhile, Amara had since reacted to the accusation. She begged Odemwingie to delete the post, saying her husband was aware of her private chat to him. She wrote: “Oh no, kindly take down this post. Kanu is fully aware of this, we want to talk to you as a family.”<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857524" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kanu.jpg" alt="" width="587" height="191" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kanu.jpg 587w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/kanu-300x98.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px">

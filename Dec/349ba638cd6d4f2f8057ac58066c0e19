The Kaduna State government has refuted media reports that Kano indigenes travelling on Abuja-kaduna road were killed by Kidnappers, saying, the indigenes died following an accident that occurred at the Rigachikun axis of the state. A statement by the Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan Thursday night, said, “The story that 16 indigenes of Kano State were killed by bandits on the Kaduna-Abuja Road is incorrect and misleading. According to the statement,
“The fact is, they perished at the Rigachikun axis of Kaduna-Zaria Road in a road accident following a burst tyre. “Our deep condolences go to their families, as we pray that their souls rest in peace. We also wish those who sustained injuries speedy recovery. “We will respond appropriately if the need arises,” The statement added.Kano

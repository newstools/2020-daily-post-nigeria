Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has thanked “players, coaches and loyal opponents” after he scored the 750th goal of his career. Ronaldo reached the milestone with a simple finish in the 57th minute of Juve’s 3-0 win over Dynamo Kiev in their Champions League clash on Wednesday. It was also his 75th across all competitions for Juve, which he joined from Real Madrid, where he scored 450 goals. The 35-year-old moved to Madrid from Manchester United for a then world-record in 2009. During his six-year stint at Old Trafford, he scored 118 times for the Red Devils. “750 goals, 750 happy moments, 750 smiles in the faces of our supporters. “Thank you to all the players and coaches that helped me reach this amazing number, thank you to all my loyal opponents that made me work harder and harder everyday,” Ronaldo tweeted.

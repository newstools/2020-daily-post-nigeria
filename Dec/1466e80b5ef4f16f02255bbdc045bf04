The embattled Chairman of Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger state, Comrade Suleiman Chukuba, said he is still the substantive Chairman of the local government. He said his impeachment by the council legislators did not stand, alleging that they did not follow due process in their dealings. Chukuba, who stated this in his office in Kuta, Shiroro local government area claimed that he had not been served any notice for suspension which the Legislators alleged to have turned his impeachment to. “Regarding the suspension, till now, I have not seen or been served any letter regarding suspension or impeachment. I am still waiting for it. You can see, I am in the office and hence, that means I am still the Chairman of this Council”. This is coming on the heels of an intervention meeting with the Niger State House of Assembly on Tuesday that led to reversal of the impeachment motion passed by the councillors on him. It would be recalled that on Tuesday, 11 out of 14 elected councillors in the council had collected signatures with the intent to sack the chairman. Chukuba was accused of mismanaging and embezzling funds meant for the Internally Generated Revenue, IGR, of the Council. But, the embattled chairman claimed that he has not misappropriated any funds of the council. He explained that Shiroro Council has been bedeviled by insecurity that has made generation of IGR difficult in the past seven years. “There is no atmosphere in Shiroro that is conducive for the market. Hence, no means of generating IGR. Sometimes in a week, we do not get more than N114,000, how do you expect the Council to survive on this in a week?,” Chukuba further stated.

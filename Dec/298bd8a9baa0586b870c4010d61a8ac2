Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard has revealed the best playing position for Kai Havertz. Lampard addressed the press ahead of his side clash against West Ham United on Monday night. The Englishman’s main talking points from his press conference was about Kai Havertz’s form and if a 4-3-3 formation suits him. “I do think it suits him. He can play in it and before his COVID-19 period he played very well on the right side of the eight position,” Lampard said “He can play in various positions but consistency is sometimes a good thing and that’s what I want to get for him. “I think we must have a huge perspective here. I mentioned that some of the greatest Premier League players we have ever seen have taken time to adapt to the league. They have even sometimes gone away and come back to do well in the PL. “We all know who those examples are so I am not saying it will take a long, long time for Kai but we have to give him time to settle in on the pitch. “I am very happy with him and I have no problem with him but Chelsea fans and us must give him time.”

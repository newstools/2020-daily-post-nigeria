The main opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) on Saturday formally received many prominent people leaving other parties into its fold. Among the new APC members are Sen Ishaku Abbo from Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Governor Bala Ngillari also from PDP, Chief Emmanuel Bello from Social Democratic Party (SDP), and Sen Abdulaziz Nyako from African Demicratic Congress (ADC). The Unity Forum meeting of the APC at which the aforementioned personalities and their followers were officially received at the APC state Secretariat on Saturday, may have marked the conclusion of a merger talk between the APC and the ADC, effectively erasing the ADC from Adamawa State, although the special collapsing of the ADC is still being expected early in 2021 Also, Emmanuel Bello joining the APC from SDP effectively ended whatever claim the party had to the state as Emmanuel Bello who was the party’s governorship candidate in last year’s election was the financier and soul of the party in the state. The ADC and SDP had been the third and fourth largest parties in Adamawa State after governing PDP and main opposition APC, with the other parties existing only in name, meaning that Adamawa is now a state with just the PDP and APC as the only notable parties. The representatives of Chief Emmanuel Bello and other newly acknowledged members of the APC said at the Unity Forum that they were coming into the APC to contribute towards wresting power from the PDP come 2023. They asked for an enabling environment within the party to play their part in that regard and in other ways that they might choose to exercise their democratic rights. In his remark, the APC Caretaker Chairman for the state, Alhaji Ibrahim Bilal, welcomed the new members and assured them of equal opportunities. He urged them to avail themselves of the opportunity of effectively registering as members of the APC when the forthcoming registration exercise of the party falls due.

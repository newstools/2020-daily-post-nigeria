Nigerian pop star, Davido, has threatened to leave the music industry. The ‘Fem’ crooner stated this in a tweet on Monday. “I go leave this music for una” Davido wrote. It is the first time he is saying anything after the purported fight with Burna Boy in a Ghanaian nightclub yesterday. Davido’s comment comes as a music producer, Paulo, appealed to him, Wizkid and Burna Boy to reconcile their differences. Paulo, in an Instagram post, pleaded with the music superstars to end their fight to advance the Africa music culture.

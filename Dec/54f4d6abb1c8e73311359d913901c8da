Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, has said that Dave Umahi, the Governor of Ebonyi State, has always been a member of the All Progressives Congress, APC. He said that Umahi had been functioning as a member of the ruling party at heart even while he was in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The Presidential aide said in a piece he titled, ‘Dave Umahi’s Heart of Lion’, where he hailed the Governor for being courageous enough to dump the opposition PDP. “Umahi had always loved and respected President Muhammadu Buhari, and never hid it, though they were of different political parties,” Adesina noted. “Umahi was PDP in the exterior, but APC at heart. Gov Umahi has done what Napoleon couldn’t do. He has officially crossed from the PDP to APC. “Only a man with the heart of a lion could do that. What Umahi exhibited last month in crossing from PDP to APC can best be described as the heart of a lion.” Umahi had recently said that his decision to make peace with the leaders of the PDP in the State had lowered his blood pressure. Recall that following his defection to the APC, the Governor entered a running battle with some elder statesmen in the State such as ex-Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim, former Governor, Sam Egwu and many others. https://dailypost.ng/2020/12/08/defection-my-blood-pressure-has- dropped-after-i-made-peace-with-pdp-gov-umahi/

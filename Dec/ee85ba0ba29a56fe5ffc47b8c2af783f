Professor Segun Ajiboye, Registrar of Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) says training of teachers in digital technology for classroom delivery will help improve the quality of learning in basic education. Ajiboye made the assertion in Ibadan while revealing that no fewer  than 1,771 teachers have already been trained. Ajiboye noted that the training was done in partnership with Teach 4 Nigeria and Nigerian Union of Teachers (NUT). Ajiboye noted that the council and the two partners trained the teachers on how to use digital technology in classroom delivery. He added that the teachers were selected from 20 states in the country. Ajiboye maintained that the training is a way to update teachers’ delivery skills and adapt to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that the training which began in November 2020 lasted for two weeks and focussed on how to utilise digital technology to propel classroom delivery. Ajiboye said, “It is becoming increasingly important and inexcusable not to possess digital knowledge to deliver classroom teachings. “This is why the federal government is equipping Nigerian Teachers with the skills to catch up with the global trends. “We mobilised 1771 Teachers spread across the country in partnership with the critical stakeholders to train them on deploying digital technology to propel teaching. “The Training which spanned over two weeks started in November and it focused on teaching in New Normal with emphasis on use of Digital technology to propel classroom delivery.”

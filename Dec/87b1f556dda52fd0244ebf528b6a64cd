The All Progressives Congress, APC, on Sunday insisted that Nigeria is not a failed state. APC said despite the challenges facing the country, Nigeria is nowhere closed to a failed state. Sen. John James Akpanudoedehe, Secretary, Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee of the ruling party stated this in a statement he issued. According to Akpanudoedehe: “While naysayers and opposition partisans chorus their doomsday wishes for Nigeria; our dear country is nowhere close to becoming a failed state. “The President Muhammadu Buhari government is not oblivious to the country’s challenges and is visibly and frontally addressing them. “From the economy to security, it is easy to sum up Nigeria with some recent recorded security incidents and the economic downturn. However, this government has displayed the political will and capacity to contain any criminal/terrorist activity and return the economy to growth. “President Buhari administration, which sees the urgent need to have a better policing system for the country and is embarking on sweeping police reforms and supporting community policing, is definitely not governing a country close to becoming a failed state.”

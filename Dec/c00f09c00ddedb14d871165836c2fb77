A former Liverpool and Real Madrid attacker, Michael Owen, has predicted Tottenham Hotspur to beat Arsenal when both sides clash in the Premier League derby on Sunday. Owen also backed Chelsea to defeat Leeds United in the Premier League on Saturday night at Old Trafford. According to him, West Ham United would get a point against Manchester United in the Premier League on Saturday evening. “Arsenal’s performance has dipped in recent weeks,” Owen told Bet Victor. “It’s been particularly noticeable that they have not had the same swagger at home as they have had in recent seasons. “Spurs have been playing well. They have adapted to Jose Mourinho’s style of play and could be in with an outside chance of winning the league. Jose has set up to play on the counter a lot this season, and I think they could further benefit if he opened up and went to teams a bit more.

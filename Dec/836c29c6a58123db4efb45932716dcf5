Bukola Saraki, former Senate President has claimed that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is the only hope Nigeria needs to survive and fully bounce back. Saraki made the assertions at the inauguration of the PDP National Reconciliation Committee in Abuja, on Tuesday. He also insisted that PDP was the best platform to rebuild and unite Nigeria. Boasting that PDP has a governor in all the geopolitical zones of the country, Saraki said the chances of the party in 2023 are bright. According to Saraki: “It is obvious that the success of the PDP today is the only hope that Nigeria needs to survive and bounce fully back. “I am proud to note that PDP is still the best platform through which we can rebuild and unite Nigeria. One indication about the significance of this party is that it is the ONLY political party that has at least a Governor in all the six geo-political zones of our country. “Our party is also the only party which has members in all the households, streets, polling zones, wards, local government areas, states and across the country such that it is said that any street or community where the symbol of the umbrella is not sighted may not be part of the Nigerian territory. “It is our belief and that of many members of this party that our chances in the 2023 elections are very bright and we need to unite ourselves to further brighten the chances.”

A 23-year-old man has been arrested by men of the Nigeria Police for allegedly killing and beheading his friend during a brawl at an Indian hemp farm in Ondo State. The suspect, Benedict Owalum who was paraded alongside other criminals, confessed to the crime at the headquarters of the Ondo State Police Command in Akure, the State capital. According to Owalum, who hails from Cross Rivers State, the deceased identified as Ekong and some other boys were workers at an Indian hemp farm in Ipele, Owo Local Government Area of Ondo State. While accusing the deceased of bewitching him, the suspect stated that he took the action because Ekong had been threatening to kill him. He said, “Five of us used to work at a farm in Ipele, where we cultivate Indian hemp for our boss called Mr Okadigbo. “We have been working there for about six months. So, on the last day when we’re to leave the farm, there’s one of us called Felix and another known as Ekong who I have been suspecting of attacking me spiritually. “Both of them had been telling me that they would have killed me since if they should have their way. I reported the issue to Mr Okadigbo but he failed to intervene. “Later I began to have health issues as I could no longer urinate due to the spiritual attack by the boys. After a while, I confronted Ekong over the development but he threatened me with a cutlass and I took my own cutlass as well and we immediately engaged in a brawl. “During the fight, he fell and I immediately cut off his head and the other boys ran away. I took the head away to the hut and later, I saw policemen who came to arrest me.”

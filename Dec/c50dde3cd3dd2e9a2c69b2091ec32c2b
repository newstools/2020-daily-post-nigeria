Suspected Boko Haram insurgents have attacked Garkida, a town in Gombi Local Government Area of Adamawa State. This is the second time this year that the insurgents would be invading the historic town after a similar attack in February. The insurgents were, Thursday night, said to have launched the fresh attack by entering Garkida through Gada Uku bridge in 13 Hilux jeeps. A source said the insurgents ransacked many stores in the town and made away with food stuffs, but that they had been chased out by security operatives. “They burnt down a vehicle while the Air Force Jets destroyed 3 of their jeeps before they moved out of the town but it was almost six hours of sporadic gunshots before they left with foodstuffs,” the source said. Another inside account stated that hunters and vigilantes had mobilized and kept vigil all through Wednesday in Garkida town after an intelligence report indicated that Boko Haram might attack the town. According to the account, “when they (Boko Haram) did not show up yesterday, the team dispersed today about 4pm. Long after the hunters had gone, the Boko Haram groups moved into the town of Garkida and right now all hell has been let loose.”

Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has declared that the Eastern Security Network, ESN, would operate without the approval of Southeast governors. Kanu made the declaration in response to remark by Dave Umahi, Governor of Ebonyi State despising ESN. Umahi, who is Chairman of the Southeast Governors’ Forum, had said the ESN was a laughable distraction. The governor urged people of the region to ignore ESN because governors were doing their best to secure the Southeast. However, Kanu said Southeast governors should stop terrorism first before tempting to stop ESN. The IPOB leader spoke through the group’s Publicity Secretary, Emma Powerful. A statement by Powerful reads partly: “We the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under the command and leadership of our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, condemn in very strong terms, the recent shameful statement credited to Gov. Dave Umahi on behalf of his fellow lilly-liverd and coward governors of South East against the newly established Eastern Security Network, ESN. “They only further exposed their emptiness and detachment from the people. “But our message to the treacherous South East Governors and their South South counterparts is that ‘the train has since left the station’ and can’t reverse it’s course. “May we remind the traitors that the Eastern region cannot be sacrificed at the altar of their political interest. It’s either they key in or shape out! The East can exist without them. They should steer clear because they can’t withstand the force behind ESN.”

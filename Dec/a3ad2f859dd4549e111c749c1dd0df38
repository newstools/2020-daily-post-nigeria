The Commissioner of Investment and Abuja Liasion in Ebonyi State, Ekumankama Joseph Nkama, has withdrawn his surety for former Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim. Nkama had stood as surety for Anyim in a trial instituted by the Economic and a Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, against the former Senate President. However, Nkama withdrew his surety status due to what he termed “recent events in the last two weeks” involving the ex-Senate President. The Commissioner withdrew his surety in a letter written to EFCC Chairman and sighted by DAILY POST, on Friday. Recall that Anyim and the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi have been involved in a face-off, following the governor’s defection to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Umahi had alleged that he planned his defection with Anyim but the latter changed his mind at the last minute. In a response to Umahi’s claim, the former Senate President had alleged that his life was threatened for refusing to defect with Umahi. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-857631 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EoYHLrJXYAAb2vz-693x1024.jpg" alt="" width="693" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EoYHLrJXYAAb2vz-693x1024.jpg 693w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EoYHLrJXYAAb2vz-203x300.jpg 203w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EoYHLrJXYAAb2vz.jpg 731w" sizes="(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px">

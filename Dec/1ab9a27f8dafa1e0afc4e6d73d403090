There was a moment of disagreement and name-calling between members of the ruling APC in the Imo State House of Assembly and the opposition lawmakers when the latter was accused of fueling the recent End SARS protest which claimed several lives in the state. The member representing Aboh-mbaise state constituency, Eddy Obinna had made the allegations while presenting a motion on Thursday during plenary. He said the opposition parties including the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cashed in on the protest to water down the efforts of the state and federal government as the ruling party. “Recall that the EndSARS protest by the youths started as a peaceful demonstration and the government was already giving it due attention. “The President, Muhammadu Buhari listened to the voice of Nigerian youths and immediately disbanded the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). It was most surprising that the peaceful deliberation soon degenerated to a full-blown war that destroyed several lives and property. “The opposition parties should be held responsible for this. We know their antics and we know what they are capable of doing,” he submitted. Reacting to the accusation, the member representing Oguta state constituency, Frank Egbuoma described the allegation as mere intimidation of the minority in the House of Assembly. According to him, Imo remains the only state that does not know the importance of the opposition in a government. “Everybody must not be in the ruling party. It is not a crime to be in the opposition and minority group. “How could a lawmaker open his mouth to accuse the opposition of sponsoring the End SARS protest that destroyed many lives in the country? “Each of us was duly elected to speak for our constituents. There should be a level playing ground. Enough is enough!” he said.

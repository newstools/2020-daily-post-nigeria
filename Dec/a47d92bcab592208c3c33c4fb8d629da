Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said they dropped points against Leicester City, because his players switched off. The Red Devils missed the chance to go into second place, following a 2-2 draw at the King Power Stadium. Marcus Rashford opened the scoring for United, before Harvey Barnes slammed in the equalizer. Although Bruno Fernandes made it 2-1 late in the second half, there was still time for Jamie Vardy’s effort to come off Axel Tuanzebe into the net. “We feel disappointed. The boys are flat in the dressing room. “We created chances to score more goals. “Apparently, Jamie Vardy got a bit lucky, but you can’t switch off against quality players,” Solskjaer told the media after the match. Fernandes was partly at fault for Leicester City’s first goal and Solskjaer has admitted that some of the risks he takes, leaves him pulling his hair out. He said: “He is definitely a player that impacts results. He takes risks. He sees the pass and takes the moments. “Sometimes I tear my hair out and say there is an easier pass. But you want that X Factor. He has been great.”

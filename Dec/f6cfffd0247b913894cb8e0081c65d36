Former Chelsea star, Diego Costa could leave Atletico Madrid in January to the west London side, according to an Italian journalist, Fabrizio Romano. The Brazilian has only six months left on his current deal and his club Atletico Madrid have already decided not to offer Costa a new deal, according to Romano. The player could reunite with Chelsea, who face Atletico in the last-16 of the Champions League in February. In another development, the Blues transfer chief Marina Granovskaia is said to be concluding arrangements for the transfer of Declan Rice from West Ham and Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. He has also placed seven players up for sale to raise funds to sign the new players. The players up for sale are Antonio Rudiger, Andres Christensen, Jorginho, Marcos Alonso, Ross Barkley, Danny Drinkwater and Victor Moses, according to Sky Sports Italia.

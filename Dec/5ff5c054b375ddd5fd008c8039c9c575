Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State on Saturday signed the 2021 budget into law. He said while signing the budget at the residential wing of the Government House in Yola that the 2021 budget was designed to stabilise the state and achieve maximum development. He said 52 percent of the N140 billion budget is earmarked for capital projects in the belief of his government that democracy without infrastructural development is a failed democracy. He added that N16 billion of the budget would be spent on development of youths and women in his administrationâ€™s commitment to human capital development for a better society. The Adamawa State House of Assembly had passed the N14O billion fiscal appropriation on Christmas eve in what was described as a rare plenary, almost exactly as the executive proposed it. Thanking the lawmakers for cooperating with him, Governor Fintiri said their untiring support which made them pass the budget at a time most people were on Christmas holiday was appreciated. Governor Fintiri had sent a total proposal of N140, 034,404,449 to the House of Assembly earlier in November, earmarking N72, 817,892,910, being 52 percent, for capital projects.

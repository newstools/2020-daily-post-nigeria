A lawmaker representing Vandeikya, Konshisha Federal Constituency of Benue State has decamped from the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to the All Progressive Congress (APC). The decamping was contained in a letter read by the Deputy Speaker Idris Wase today during plenary. Hembe cited fractions in his party at the state level for his decision to decamp from his party. The Minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu kicked against the move, describing it as unconstitutional and asked that Mr. Hembe’s seat should be declared vacant. “He was elected under APGA, and I am not aware that APGA is undergoing any crisis. His decamping is illegal, hence his seat should be declared vacant. He was, however, ruled out of order by the Deputy Speaker who noted that there is a crisis in APGA.

Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has named Chelsea as ‘favourites’ to win the Premier League title this season. Frank Lampard’s side are now top of the table, after they defeated Leeds United 3-1 on Saturday. Defending champions, Liverpool will move back above the Blues, if they beat Wolves on Sunday, while Tottenham could also occupy top spot after their north London derby clash against Arsenal. But Klopp insists his team is not “chasing anybody”, as Chelsea are favourites. “I don’t feel in this moment that we chase anybody or somebody chases us. “If I watch football games, then I see that Tottenham is obviously doing pretty well, that Chelsea for me in the moment looks like the favourite – bigger squad, great players, play football.”

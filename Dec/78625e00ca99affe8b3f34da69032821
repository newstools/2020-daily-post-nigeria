The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has issued a 72-hour notice to operators of illegal car marts across the city to vacate or face prosecution. Malam Wadata Bodinga, FCT Head of Ministerial Task Team on Removal of Illegal Auto Marts, made this known at a meeting with stakeholders, on Friday in Abuja, NAN reports. Bodinga noted that Abuja was a planned city with every area designated for a particular purpose, which must not be violated. He said that operators of illegal car marts in Wuse, Gudu, Garki, Maitama and other areas must move out immediately. “We have gone round the FCT and have seen areas where the marts are operating illegally, we have removed them in the past, they came back, but this time around, we will not only remove them , we will also prosecute them. “These illegal car marts have mostly constituted nuisances on the major ways in the city centre, causing accidents and traffic gridlocks. “They park in green bridges and walkways,” Bodinga said. Speaking also, Alhaji Murktar Galadima, FCTA Director, Department of Development Control, said that the authority would not spare any individual in its bid to sanitise the city. According to him, this is sheer indiscipline and impunity. “We have been making efforts to ensure that the city is kept clean and some people think they are above the law,” he said.

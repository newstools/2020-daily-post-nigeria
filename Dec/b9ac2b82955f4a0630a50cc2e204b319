Kashim Shettima, Senator from Borno Central, has called for the removal of Nigeria’s Service Chiefs, amid the issues of insecurity plaguing the country. Shettima, a former Governor of Borno State said the current Service Chiefs are dispensable, hence they should be removed. Appearing on Arise Television, the lawmaker insisted that the Service Chiefs were no longer effective in the discharge of their duties. Shettima said the current Service Christmas Chiefs should be replaced with people who have new ideas on how to tackle the plague of insecurity. He said, “Why I was agitating for the removal of the security chiefs has to do with the fact that they have given their best but their best is no longer good enough. Shehu Shagari had three service chiefs in his four years of stewardship. “Nobody is indispensable. And the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. We believe that morale is high; there is the need for an injection of people with new ideas, with fresher perspectives to come and address the issues. “By June next year, Course 35 is going without reaching the pinnacle of their careers. So justice, equity, fairness and even commonsense demands that these service chiefs should go.” Lately, there has been intense call on President Muhammadu Buhari to sack his Service Chiefs over the failing security architecture in the country. While Nigerians were still mourning the massacre in Zabarmari, Borno State by Boko Haram sect, some unknown gunmen had abducted students of Government Science Secondary School in Kankara, Katsina State.

The Traditional ruler of Isinigbo community in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State, Oba Samuel Fadahunsi, on Friday escaped death by the whiskers following an attack on his palace. The monarch’s palace which was attacked by unknown gunmen was also set ablaze with the traditional ruler trapped inside. Oba Fadahunsi who is 100-years-old was said to have been rescued after his subjects mobilized themselves to chase the gunmen away. Isinigbo had in the past few days been at loggerheads with its neighbouring community, Ude over a land tussle, with youths from Isinigbo, protesting the destruction of their houses by the Ajagun of Ude, Sunday Boboye. The protest which later turned violent led to the setting ablaze of Boboye’s palace. Following the attack on his palace, Ajagun of Ude allegedly fled for safety but another attack was reportedly launched against him when he returned to the community. According to Oba Boboye, he secured a court judgement in 2017 that a large portion of land sold by Isinigbo belonged to him, adding that all efforts to call the new buyers for negotiation failed as they offered to pay N100,000 per plot against the N600,000 he demanded. On his part, the Secretary of Isinigbo, Adeleye Rotimi, said the community never envisaged an attack until the gunmen entered the community through a different route. While disclosing that Oba Fadahunsi was responding to treatment at an undisclosed hospital, Rotimi denied allegations of offering to pay N100,000 to Boboye to allow them remain in the lands. Meanwhile, two persons who said they hail from Kogi State have been arrested by men of the 32 Artillery Brigade Owena cantonment over the dispute between Ude and Isinigbo. The two suspects, identified as Fatai Ali, 25 and Onu Adejo, 27 who were caught with live ammunition allegedly confessed that they were hired to come to Ondo State. They have now been handed over to the Ondo State Police for further investigation.

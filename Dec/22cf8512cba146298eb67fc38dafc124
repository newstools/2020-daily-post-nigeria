Tottenham Hotspur forward, Gareth Bale, will miss the next “few weeks” after he suffered a calf injury in their League Cup quarter-final win at Stoke City last week, manager Jose Mourinho has said. Bale, who is on loan from La Liga champions, Real Madrid, started and scored in the 3-1 victory, but was withdrawn at halftime. Mourinho is short of backup options in attack with the former Chelsea manager saying Lucas Moura and Carlos Vinicius were also doubts for Wednesday’s Premier League match against Fulham. “No, I don’t expect him [Gareth Bale] to be fit, and also I have my doubts that Lucas and Vinicius can be fit for Fulham. “I would not say it is serious [for Bale], but I would say a few weeks,” Mourinho told reporters when asked about Bale’s status. Bale, who was named Player of the Year in his final season at Tottenham before a then-world record moves to Real Madrid in 2013, has yet to live up to those standards, scoring only three times for Spurs this season.

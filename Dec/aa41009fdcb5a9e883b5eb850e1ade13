The Nigeria Centre For Disease Control (NCDC) has said that in spite of the announcements of the discovery of vaccines to tackle novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, mass production of the vaccines is still far. The NCDC said that for this reason, Nigerians must continue to observe non-pharmaceutical measures against COVID-19. The Director-General of NCDC, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, stated this during the weekly briefing of the task force on COVID-19 in Abuja on Monday. Ihekweazu said, “Although there had been some encouraging news about COVID-19 vaccines, mass production of the vaccines might still take time. “We’re even very far from having one with a licence; so, we’ve to tighten our belts and get through this month of December. “Everyone should be vigilant, disciplined and abide by the general protocols that we have advised throughout the year. “This is the best way that we can keep our loved ones safe and transit safely into 2021. “This is particularly important for the elderly in our country who we may want to go and visit as we do by this time of the year.” NCDC on Monday night announced 145 new cases of COVID-19 in the country. The 145 new infections take the number of cases in the country to 67,557.

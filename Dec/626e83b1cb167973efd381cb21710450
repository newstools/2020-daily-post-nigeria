The member representing Ahoada-East/Abua/Odual Federal Constituency, Rivers State, Solomon Bob on Thursday described the snubbing of the Joint Session of the National Assembly by President Muhamadu Buhari as of a clear case questioning the existence of the legislature. Mr. Bob raised a point of order on privilege, demanding answers from the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila on why the President who was scheduled to appear before the joint session of the House did not honour the invitation. It would be recalled that the President, following a motion of the House was invited to appear before the Joint session of the National Assembly. DAILY POST reported that the President will honour the invitation. However, the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami on Wednesday in a press statement said the House had no right to summon the President. Mr Bob, citing order 8, rule 6, said the privilege of the House has been breached, adding that President Buhari flagrantly disregarded the resolution of the House. He said: “Last week we passed a resolution, bordering on security. I read in the newspaper that the president agreed to come. However, the events following the resolution has shown that the resolution has been flagrantly disregarded. If this House should pass a resolution, and it is disregarded, then it questions our existence here. Our very existence here is being questioned. “The Speaker should address us. Maybe there has been a back channel, we need to know. Nigerians are watching, the world is watching, watching what we will do. This action is capable of showing that the House is of no significance.” Ruling on the point of order, the Speaker said his motion has been noted, adding that the House is “waiting for official communication from the President.”

Professor Chukwuma Osakwe, a renowned scholar on military history, is dead. Osakwe was the former Head of Department of History and War Studies of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), and Head of Centre for the Study of Leadership and Complex Military Operations. Reacting to his passing, President Muhammadu Buhari, in a statement signed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Sunday, condoled with the family of Osakwe. Buhari noted that Osakweâ€™s contributions to research and educational development would be sorely missed. According to him, the nation had lost an asset and intellectual giant, with the passing of the former Head of Department of History and War Studies of the Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA), and Head of Centre for the Study of Leadership and Complex Military Operations. The President extolled the scholar for always putting Nigeria first in his priorities and working very hard to provide fresh insights into the possibilities of a more coordinated and synergized military structure and operation that will herald a peaceful and harmonious society. He also lauded the deceased for turning down many offers in Nigeria and abroad, to remain in academia. Buhari prayed that the almighty God would accept the soul of the departed and comfort his loved ones.

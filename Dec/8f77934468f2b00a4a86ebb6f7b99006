Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will be without three key players when they host Aston Villa in the Premier League on Friday night at Old Trafford. The players are Edinson Cavani, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo. Cavani will miss Man United’s clash against Aston Villa due to suspension, while Jones and Rojo have been injured. Man United made this known in a post via their official website on Thursday. The Red Devils head to the game after beating Wolves 1-0 in their previous Premier League fixture on Tuesday. Solskjaer’s men are currently in the second position on the Premier League table with 30 points from 15 games. Man United can move level on points with Premier League leaders Liverpool with a victory against Aston Villa on New Year day.

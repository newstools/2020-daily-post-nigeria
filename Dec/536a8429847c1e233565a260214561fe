Prof. Femi Odekunle, a member of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), is dead. Odekunle, 77, was Nigeria’s first Professor of Criminology. He died at the COVID-19 Isolation Center in Gwagwalada, Abuja, Tuesday evening. Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, seemingly made a veiled reference to his demise. “A good friend of this government just passed on at 6:30pm”, the SGF said at the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 briefing. Odekunle, a graduate of the University of Ibadan in 1968, got his PhD in Sociology and Social Psychiatry from the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, United States, in 1974. Odekunle lectured at the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in Kaduna, and other universities. President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed shock at the demise. Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, described Odekunle as a valued friend and a towering intellectual giant with an impeccable knowledge of his chosen academic field. “His death is very saddening. His lasting contributions as well as his charisma, wit and sense of humor will be sorely missed by all of us, his friends and associates. May the Almighty repose his soul,” he said.

For several years, Malta Guinness, Africa’s No. 1 Adult premium malt drink, has injected Energy, Vitality and Goodness into Nigeria. To celebrate decades of incredible impact, the brand has started a series titled “Journey to Greatness” to tell the stories of inspiring Nigerians who have enjoyed the goodness of Malta Guinness on their greatness journey. The 6-episode series showcases the journey of talented individuals from various fields, the likes of Basket Mouth, Kaffy, Ibrahim Suleiman, Ur Flames, ChyNwakanma, Xtreme telling their stories of trials and truths as well as the significant role of Malta Guinness in their growth, development and careers. Social media has been going off the hooks with their trending just released trailer. Speaking about the series, Marketing Manager Ifeoma Agunoted, “The Series is definitely a must watch! It highlights some of the individual brands Malta Guinness has worked with and how far they have come. We cannot celebrate our incredible milestone of 30 years without acknowledging the greatness of Nigerians and the ever-present CAN- Do spirit.” For more details on the series, check out our Instagram @maltaguinnessng and YouTube channels.

The Oyo State Police Command has said that two bodies were recovered in an effort to rescue one Hassan Mills, a foreigner who was kidnapped by gunmen in the State. Channels Tv reports that Mills was abducted at about 5pm on Saturday from Panorama Farm Mekun in the Oke Alaro area of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The Police Public Relations Officer in Oyo, Olugbenga Fadeyi, who confirmed the abduction and death of the two persons, in a statement, said a soldier and a civilian was killed while a lieutenant of the Nigeria Army sustained a gunshot wound. Fadeyi explained that the victim was abducted at the entrance of the farm by yet-to-be-identified armed men who shot sporadically before taking him away into the forest. He noted that a distress call to the Divisional Police Officer in Oke Alaro led to a chase after the abductors who fled with their victim into the forest. “A team of Operation Burst which was invited by the company arrived at the area and proceeded on a hot chase into the forest. “One army lieutenant sustained gunshot injury on his right lap and immediately taken to the hospital while the personal assistant to the victim who was also abducted escaped during an exchange of gunfire. “Two corpses of one soldier and a civilian were recovered from the forest while a civil defence personnel also sustained gunshot injury after a search of the forest,” the statement said. He, however, appealed to residents of the state to support the police with useful and credible information on the whereabouts of the fleeing armed men.

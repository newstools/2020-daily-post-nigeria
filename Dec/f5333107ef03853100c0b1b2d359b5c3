The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has described the warning by the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 against Christmas Carols to curb a second wave of the virus as insensitive. The Vice-Chairman (Northern region) of the umbrella Christian body, Rev. John Hayab, stated this on Wednesday. The Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, explained that Christmas carol services and other gatherings during the festive period were capable of becoming ‘super spreaders’ of COVID-19. However, CAN said it was not right for the government to threaten a ban on Christmas carol without consulting the leadership of the church. Hayab said, “Christians have been holding worship services and observing all Federal Government protocols, and other medical advice on coronavirus since the lockdown was relaxed and worship centres were reopened. “So, what we expected from the PTF was advice for continued compliance by religious bodies and the general public to the already established protocols. “But to mention Christmas Carol or suggest a ban only shows how insensitive some privileged government officials can be. “The Church is doing more than what the PTF has requested us to do till now, and church leaders are still encouraging followers to practice those protocols both at home, market and anywhere there were more than ten persons. “CAN remains ready and willing to work with, and help the PTF and all other relevant agencies to sensitize our congregations to observe any new or additional protocols to stop the spread of the virus, but the message from the PTF about the Christmas Carol is wrong and poorly timed.”

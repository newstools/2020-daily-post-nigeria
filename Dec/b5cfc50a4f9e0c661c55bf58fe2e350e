Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has insisted they don’t have any advantage over Manchester United ahead of this weekend’s derby. Guardiola was able to rest key players against Marseille in the Champions League on Wednesday, with City already assured of finishing top in Group C. Manchester United need at least a point when they travel to RB Leipzig, to be sure of qualifying from Group H. It means Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is likely to field a full strength team in Germany on Tuesday. But Guardiola believes United will be fresh when the two teams meet at Old Trafford on Saturday. “I’m pretty sure it’s a derby and we will focus and commit and this means the players are not tired, completely the opposite,” Guardiola said. United have won three of the four Manchester derbies last season, including a 2-0 victory on March 8, which was the last game at Old Trafford to host fans before the coronavirus lockdown.

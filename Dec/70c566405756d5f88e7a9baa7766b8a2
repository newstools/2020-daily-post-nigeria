The Nigerian government, on Thursday, blamed the prolonged university strike on the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment made the remark while faulting claims by the University of Jos chapter of ASUU that he was responsible for the current industrial action. Ngige maintained that ASUU has refused to reciprocate federal government’s offer. In a statement by his Media Office, the Minister insisted that the government has met ASUU’s conditions. He said: “It is rather ASUU which has bluntly refused to reciprocate the Federal Government offers by refusing to either teach, conduct researches or engage in other academic values for which they are paid, that should be held responsible. “Strangely, ASUU claims ‘patriotism’ as the basis for this prolonged industrial action, forcing every patriot to raise concern over this weird definition of patriotism by ASUU officials. “Living by its words, the Federal Government has fulfilled all the demands over which ASUU went on strike on March 9, 2020. “It is therefore preposterous for the University of Jos chapter of ASUU under Dr. Maigoro to refer to these concrete steps taken by the Federal Government as a “promissory note” with which Nigerians shouldn’t expect ASUU to call off the strike.” ASUU has been on strike for about nine months due to the federal government’s alleged inability to meet the 2009 agreement reached. Recently, the federal government also promised to pay all outstanding allowances owed the union. Ngige had disclosed that the government will release N75billion for the revitalisation of universities and the payment of Earned Academic Allowances.

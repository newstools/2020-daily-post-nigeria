Borno State Governor, Babagana Umara Zulum on Monday berated the military over the attacks on travelers and villagers by Boko Haram insurgents in Jakana area of the state. Jakana is one of the major towns along Maiduguri-Damaturu highway where Boko Haram has been carrying series of successful attacks on travelers. The Governor was in the town following Friday’s kidnap of over 30 travelers by the insurgents. Zulum said that he was majorly disappointed for the fact that majority of the attacks within the last two years, took place between Auno and Jakana, a distance of about 20 kilometers. The Governor, who noted that he had occasions to defend the military to boost their morale, said however, that he was “really disappointed that despite all support from both the Federal Government and from us in Borno state, our military is failing to secure an area of 20 kilometers, which is the distance between Auno and Jakana.” They lamented that attacks in the area keeps happening, wondering “if the military cannot secure 20 kilometers, how can they keep us with the hope they will defeat the Boko Haram?” The Governor was not angry with military alone but also lambasted the state established Rapid Response Squad for lack of visibility along the Maiduguri-Damaturu road. “With all you (journalists) we drove from Maiduguri to here, Jakana. We did not see soldiers on the road, we did not see even our own rapid response squad on this road and they were trained, employed, kitted and paid to protect all Nigerians.” Recall that over 10 vehicles including buses carrying passengers along the Maiduguri-Damaturu road were intercepted on Friday by Boko Haram terrorists and ISWAP at about 3:00pm around Jakana village with many passengers abducted.

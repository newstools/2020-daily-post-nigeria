Justice Muhammad will administer the oath on the 72 SANs at the main courtroom of the Supreme Court on Monday, December 14, 2020. The inauguration is part of the events that will formally flag off the 2020/2021 legal year of the court. Director of Information of the Supreme Court, Dr Akande Festus who disclosed this in a statement in Abuja, recalled that the 2019/2020 legal year officially ended on Friday, September, 11. 2020. Akande disclosed that the event would be limited to stakeholders and dignitaries. The statement reads in part, “Even though normal court sittings started almost immediately after the formal end of the last legal year, no official ceremony has been held in accordance with the age-long tradition of the Supreme Court to formally herald the commencement of the new legal year due to the raging COVID-19 pandemic. “However, in strict adherence to the Covid-19 protocol, spouses and friends of the 72 new Senior Advocates will not be allowed into the Courtroom as was done in the past.”

Former Arsenal player, Ian Wright, has claimed that the club’s young players are praising manager, Mikel Arteta, secretly despite the Gunners’ poor run of form this season. Arsenal have not won a match in their last five Premier League fixtures and have lost all of their last four games at home. But Wright is now saying that the players are happy with Arteta’s leadership. Speaking ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Southampton on Wednesday night, Wright said on Ringer FC’s ‘Wrighty’s House’ podcast, “He’s put that out there for the players to see. They have to react. “You know what that manager’s doing… he’s taking the bullets. It doesn’t come any clearer for me to see that. “That is the kind of thing of thing where players who want to bail out, they want to hear what Mourinho says, ‘rats [in the dressing room]’ so they can say, ‘f*** him, man’. “But when you come out and do what Mikel does when I speak to the young guys I always ask them, ‘how’s Mikel with you?’ and they always say, ‘he’s brilliant, he’s always good, he’s brilliant’.”

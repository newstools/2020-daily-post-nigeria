The Presidency has debunked reports that former Ogun State Governor, Ibikunle Amosun, transferred the sum of N12.5million from the state account to President Muhammadu Buhari, when he was still in office. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, wrote on Twitter that the money in question was transferred to ‘PMB Estate’. Shehu claimed the President Muhammadu Buhari Estate in Abeokuta was only named after the president, but belongs to the state government. “PMB Estate is owned by the Ogun State government. Of course, that does not confer the ownership of the estate on President Buhari,” the statement read in part. Shehu added that “to set the record straight, we spoke with the official who posted the clarification of the payment voucher on Twitter. He worked with the Governor Amosun administration. He confirmed that the payment was made from the Ogun State Revenue Account to The PMB Estate Account for some work done on the Estate. Absolutely nothing to do with President Muhammadu Buhari.”

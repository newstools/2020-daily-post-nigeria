La Liga giants, Atletico Madrid, want Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud, as Diego Costa’s replacement at Wanda Metropolitano, according to RAI Sport. The Los Rojiblancos are looking for a replacement for Costa after the Spaniard terminated his contract with Atletico Madrid on Tuesday following mutual consent. Costa said it was the best moment for him and Atletico Madrid to part ways, adding that he has given his best to the Spanish club. Atletico Madrid manager, Diego Simeone, has set his sights on Giroud as Costa’s replacement given the Frenchman’s impressive record in the Premier League. Simeone is considering a swoop to bring Giroud to Atletico when the transfer window opens in January. Giroud, 34, is set to become a free agent at the end of the 2020/21 season. Chelsea could be tempted into selling the former Arsenal forward. Giroud has scored three goals in nine Premier League appearances for Frank Lampard’s side so far this campaign.

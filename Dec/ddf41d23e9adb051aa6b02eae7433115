President Muhammadu Buhari, on Thursday, said that the people will be doing themselves a lot of favour when they do the right things in a democracy. Buhari also said that the future of the country lies in the hands of its leaders. Buhari spoke at State House, Abuja, when he played host to The Gambia President, Adama Barrow Barrow was on a courtesy visit to the Nigerian leader. Buhari used the opportunity to remind other leaders that the future of their countries lies in their hands. “We must respect our people, and appreciate their support. And when the people do the right things, they do themselves a lot of favour,” Buhari said. Remembering the role Nigeria played in removing Yahya Jammeh, the country’s immediate past President, who had refused to accept defeat of election he lost in 2016, Buhari said it was the least Nigeria could do, in leading an ECOWAS onslaught against the sit-tight President. “I was in Gambia physically at least two times,” President Buhari recalled, adding: “It was the least we could do to stabilize the region.

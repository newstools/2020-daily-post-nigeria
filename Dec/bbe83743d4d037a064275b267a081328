The Nigerian Government has said that the price of data in the country has been reduced by more than 50 per cent following an order that the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) should put in place measures to that effect. Dr Isa Ibrahim Pantami, the Minister of Communications and digital economy, made this known in a statement by Femi Adeluyi, his Assistant of Information Technology, on Wednesday. According to him, it was in line with the directive he gave to NCC to put measures in place to reduce the average cost of data in Nigeria. The statement read in part, “The Honourable Minister said it was in line with the directive he gave to NCC to put measures in place to reduce the average cost of data in Nigeria. “The Plan was unveiled and launched by His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari on the 19th of March, 2020. “One of the goals of the Plan is to reduce the average cost of 1GB of data to a maximum of N390 by 2025.”

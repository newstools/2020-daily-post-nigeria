The Federal Government of Nigeria has expressed confidence that COVID-19 would soon be a thing of the past in the country as two vaccines under trial have more than 90 per cent efficacy to end the disease. Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, stated this on Tuesday during an event held in Abuja to commemorate the 2020 World AIDS Day with the theme, ‘Global Solidarity, Shared Responsibility.’ Mustapha also urged Nigerians to take necessary precautions to avoid being infected with the coronavirus. “As Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, we have consciously taken steps to ensure that as a country our citizens do the needful to avoid being infected or infecting others with COVID-19 and with two vaccines under trial potentially having more than 90 per cent efficacy, I believe that ultimately there will be light at the end of the tunnel,” Mustapha said. He added, “drawing from this, it is also very apt that Nigeria has chosen a theme: “United to end AIDS in the midst of COVID – 19: Get tested”. “Nigeria as a country aligned fully with the global solidarity and shared responsibility, which requires us to view global health responses, including the AIDS response, in a new way.” Meanwhile, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Tuesday night announced 281 new cases of COVID-19 in the country. The 281 new infections take the number of cases in the country to 67,838.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will be without both Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani for Tuesday’s crunch Champions League clash at RB Leipzig. Both forwards suffered injuries during their 3-1 win over West Ham in the Premier League on Saturday. Cavani was replaced by Marcus Rashford at half-time, while Martial was withdrawn for Juan Mata just after the hour mark. Solskjaer, addressing the press on Monday, said the two players have just “minor niggles” but neither are fit enough to make the trip to Germany. United need a point to secure qualification for the last-16 of the Champions League, but they will drop down to the Europa League should they lose to the Bundesliga side. In the absences of both Martial and Cavani, Solskjaer is likely to give Mason Greenwood a start after he scored at West Ham.

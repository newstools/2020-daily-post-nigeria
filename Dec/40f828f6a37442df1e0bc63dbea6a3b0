Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted some of the Premier League fixtures that will be played on Sunday. Tottenham Hotspur will host Leicester City with both sides looking to cement their places in the top four of the table. “I’m backing Spurs in this one because they need the win. It is a really important game for them, especially after the Liverpool heartbreak. Prediction 2-1,” Berbatov told BetFair. The Bulgarian’s former team United will then clash with Leeds United at Old Trafford. “I think because Leeds play open football and they are brave going forward, there will be a lot more space for United to counter attack and cause problems with their speed. “But Leeds do not care who they play and stick to their game. I can see lots of goals in this one. Prediction 3-2,” Berbatov added.

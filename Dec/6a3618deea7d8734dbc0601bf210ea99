The Senator representing Niger East in the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani Musa, on Tuesday, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the current Service Chiefs. Musa said the Services Chiefs should be sacked because they have done enough. The lawmaker made the remark on the floor of the senate while contributing to a motion on the recent kidnapping of students at the Government Science School in Kankara, Katsina State. He lamented that Nigerians are dying daily due to insecurity. “Every day, people are dying and nothing is happening, and we continue to talk, we continue to go and console them. We can’t bring those lives back. “We can’t continue to be leaders, when the people we are leading are being killed every day. What are the police doing? “Yesterday, armed bandits were roaming the streets of Tekina going to buy bread and geisha (canned fish), and nobody is saying anything to them. And then we will continue to live here and think we are at peace with ourselves? “Mr. President, there’s a need for this chamber to draw the attention of Mr. President that enough is enough, these Service Chiefs Should go. We should give impetus to new blood. “There are people that have new ideas. Technology is taking over everything today. We don’t have the army; we don’t have the police, why don’t we deploy the technology? “Just recently, someone said we should bring mercenaries to Nigeria, why should we bring mercenaries to Nigeria when we have vibrant youths that are ready to stand for this country. “I’m not emotional; I’m being honest and talking from the heart. Enough of this thing. “Mr. President, I wish the National Assembly will take drastic action on this. We have the powers to appropriate; we have been appropriating. Where are these funds going to? Are these Service Chiefs the only people that can defend the territorial integrity of this country?”, Senator Sani queried.

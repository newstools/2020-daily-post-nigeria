The Special Ministerial Task Force on Transportation has said it will start prosecuting commercial motorcycle operators known as Okada and their patronisers. Field Coordinator of the task force, Mr Peter Olumuji, made the disclosure on Tuesday in Abuja, NAN reports. Olumuji said anyone who patronises the Okada riders would be seen to be aiding and abetting illegality. He stated that both operators and patronisers are assumed to be guilty and liable for prosecution accordingly. He also alleged that most of the Okada riders always go about with knives and at any little provocation, stab persons involved, apart from committing other crimes. “They have designated places far away from the city centre where they are allowed to operate, Keke Napep was brought in from town and they have been operating without a hitch or constituting nuisances to the community,” he said.

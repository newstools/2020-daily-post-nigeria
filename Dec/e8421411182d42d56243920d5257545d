Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has expressed his pride after they beat Brighton 1-0 on Tuesday night. Alexandre Lacazette netted the only goal of the game 21 seconds after replacing Gabriel Martinelli. The French striker was given too much space inside the box and he lashed Bukayo Saka’s cross past Robert Sanchez. “I’m proud for the boys and happy for the result. Lacazette is in a good moment, he’s full of confidence. “Today he had a sore back, he could not start the game. But he came on and won the game for us which is massively important. “We know we’ve been struggling with results, [and] the fact we won against Chelsea was a big boost. To come here and get another win was massively important,” Arteta said.

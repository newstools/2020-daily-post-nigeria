Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, will leave Lionel Messi out of his squad for a Champions League match at Ferencvaros on Wednesday. The LaLiga side has already qualified for the knockout stages with two games to spare. Barca tops Group G with 12 points from four games but sits in seventh place in the Spanish topflight, 10 points behind leaders Real Sociedad. Koeman has now decided to rest his key men for the match in Hungary. “We wouldn’t normally do this, but with the calendar being what it is this year there are only a few opportunities to rest people and tomorrow is one of them,” he told a press conference today. Goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen and Brazilian midfielder Coutinho will also sit out the match to be fresh for domestic duties. “Saturday’s match (against Cadiz) is an important one for our progress in the league, and after tomorrow, there will be few opportunities to rest for anyone,” Koeman said.

The G8 group, a faction of the All Progressive Congress (APC) that battled former governor, Abdul Aziz Yari in 2019 over governorship primary election has reunited with the former governor to fight PDP in today’s Bakura Local Government bye-election in Zamfara State. Our correspondent can authoritatively report that former governor Mahmud’s Aliyu Shinkafi and other members of the group were seen campaigning for APC for the bye-election in Bakura. But when contacted, one of the G8 group member, senator Kabiru Marafa said that he was done politically with former governor Abdul Aziz Yari, saying that he had already built his political dynasty before Yari became somebody in Zamfara State politics. ” I don’t want to join issues with former governor, Abdul Aziz Yari because he is a junior politician in Zamfara State politics.” According to one of the G8 group members, Hon.

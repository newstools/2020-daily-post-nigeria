The All Progressives Congress (APC) has congratulated Prof. Mahmood Yakubu on his reappointment and Senate’s confirmation as Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). APC said Yakubu has the task of ensuring an unbiased and apolitical election in Nigeria. A statement by APC’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, however, admitted that Nigeria’s election was not perfect. According to Nabena: “Our election processes are far from perfect, however, marked improvements have been recorded in a series of recent elections conducted. The task before Prof. Mahmood Yakubu and the election management body he leads is to strive further in being unbiased and apolitical. “Technological innovations recently introduced and deployed by INEC have greatly improved the credibility and efficiency of our election processes. We must continue to support and invest in these innovations.” The Party also urges INEC to continually embark on regular voter education and sensitisation to improve voter turnout and check illegalilites such as “vote buying and other emerging frauds in our electioneering processes.” Nabena added: “In all elections, valid votes must count and the majority will of the electorate must prevail. This is a creed INEC and indeed all partisans must subscribe to in the interest of our democracy.”

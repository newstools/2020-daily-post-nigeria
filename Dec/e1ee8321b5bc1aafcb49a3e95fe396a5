Nigeria’s former vice-president, Atiku Abubakar, has urged the federal government to ban flights to and from the United Kingdom (UK), as the second wave of COVID-19 takes over. Atiku made the call in a series of tweets from his official handle on Sunday. According to him, the country took a harder-than-necessary hit during the first wave, because the FG failed to heed warnings of well-meaning Nigerians. He further warned that Nigeria’s health sector is not sufficiently prepared to handle a sudden and unpredictable surge of the pandemic. “The reason Nigeria took a harder than necessary hit during the first wave of the #COVID19 virus is that the Federal Government failed to heed the warnings of well-meaning Nigerians, like myself and others, to shut down our borders once the virus became a pandemic. “The new strain of COVID19 that has erupted in the United Kingdom, and specifically, London, can add to Nigeria’s health emergency if we do not act with an abundance of caution and temporarily halt all flights to and from the UK until this new strain is brought under control,” Atiku wrote. The coronavirus strand in the UK has been found to have a higher transmission rate. Cities like London have already gone into complete lockdown.

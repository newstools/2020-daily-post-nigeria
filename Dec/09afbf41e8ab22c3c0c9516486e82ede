FIFA has cancelled the U-17 and U-20 World Cups that were to hold in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The U-17 World Cup was scheduled to take place in Peru and the U-20 World Cup in Indonesia. FIFA, in a statement has confirmed both countries will now host the respective competitions in 2023. “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present challenges for the hosting of international sporting events and to have a restrictive effect on international travel. “FIFA has therefore regularly consulted the relevant stakeholders, including the host member associations as well as the confederations involved in both tournaments originally scheduled to take place in 2021. “In doing so, it became clear that the global situation has failed to normalize to a sufficient level to address the challenges associated with hosting both tournaments, including the feasibility of the relevant qualification pathways,” the statement read.

The Ekiti State Police Commissioner, Mr Babatunde Mobayo, has assured that the police will work with other security agencies in the state to secure the release of a businessman, Mr. Happiness Ajayi Okunola, who was kidnapped by unknown gunmen. Okunola was abducted at about 6pm alongside one Oluwaseun Fatile between Isan-Iludun road on Christmas day while travelling on that route. With the intervention of the Police, Amotekun corps and some hunters, Fatile was rescued after the captors were given a hot chase into the bush. The criminals, however, succeeded in taking Okunola away into captivity. Speaking with journalists in Ado Ekiti, on Monday, the police boss, who spoke through the Command’s Public Relations Officer, ASP Sunday Abutu, said the police are working hard to ensure Okunola is released safe and sound. “The police are making concerted efforts. We are combing the expansive forest from Isan, Iludun, Eda Oniyo up to the Kwara border. “We won’t rest until the man is let off the hook, because we won’t allow criminals to begin to profit from this kind of crime.” Abutu added that the abductee’s family has not in any way informed the police that millions of naira was being demanded as ransom. “We are not aware of this. We are only working on available information we got through intelligence gathering. We are closing in on them and people should be rest assured that the man will be brought home unhurt”. It was gathered that 24 hours after Okunola was kidnapped, the abductors contacted the family to demand the sum of N100 million for his release. Our sources say the abductors later reduced the ransom amount to N10 million and subsequently N2 million.

Spain and Sweden have recorded the coronavirus variant first identified in the United Kingdom. Four cases reported in Madrid all arrived from the UK recently. Regional government’s deputy health chief, Antonio Zapatero, made the disclosure to reporters on Saturday. “The patients are not seriously ill, we know that this strain is more transmissible but it does not cause more serious illness,” he said. Three others suspected cases have been tested, and results will be available on or before Wednesday. Similarly, Sweden said a traveler from Britain fell ill on arrival and tested positive. On Saturday, Sara Byfors, a health agency official, told the media that the individual kept isolated after, and no further cases yet. Spain, Sweden, among dozens of other countries, have imposed travel restrictions on passengers from the UK.

Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has reacted to the death of Sam Nda-Isaiah, Publisher of Leadership Newspaper. Tinubu described Nda-Isaiah as a courageous and conscientious journalist and columnist. Nda-Isaiah had died yesterday after a brief illness. However, the APC National Leader said Nda-Isaiah’s death was a blow to the journalism world. The former Lagos State governor stated this in a statement by his spokesman, Tunde Rahman. The statement reads: “I’m deeply shocked and saddened by the news of the death of Leadership Newspaper publisher, Mr. Sam Nda-Isaiah. “He was a friend and associate. We had a built cordial relationship between us long before we founded the APC together with others and before he contested for the presidential ticket at the primaries of our party in 2014. “As a journalist and columnist, he was bold, courageous, and conscientious. A pharmacist, he made an audacious move when he founded the Leadership newspaper in 2001. “Nda-Isaiah was not only a newspaper publisher, he was also an entrepreneur with varied business interests. “His death is a blow to the journalism profession, which he served with all his heart. Perhaps, his last major appearance was last Tuesday’s Annual General Meeting of the Newspaper Proprietors Association of Nigeria held in Lagos. My condolences to the NPAN. I commiserate with the management and staff of Leadership newspaper. “I mourn in particular with his wife, children, and relations. May Almighty Allah comfort them and give them the strength to cope with this sudden death of their patriarch. I also extend my condolences to Etsu Nupe, His Royal Highness, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar, Governor Abubakar Sani Bello, the government and people of Niger State for the loss of their illustrious son. I pray that the soul of our friend, Nda-Isaiah, find eternal rest.”

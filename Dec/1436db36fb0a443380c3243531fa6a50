An eyewitness has denied that the shooting of a commercial motorcycle operator by a policeman on Tuesday night in Igboukwu, Aguata LGA of Anambra State was an accidental discharge. The state police command’s spokesperson, SP Haruna Mohammed while confirming the killing of the motorcyclist and the burning of Igboukwu police station had said the killing was as a result of accidental discharge following an altercation. But a commercial motorcycle operator who gave his name as Sylvanus and who claimed to be an eyewitness said the policeman aimed at the motorcyclist and fired at him after threatening to waste him. “We saw what happened. The police people usually take advantage of the law banning motorcycles from operating after 9pm to extort from okada people. They just stay in a roadblock and any okada person that passes, they make them pay N100 before you proceed. “The policemen insisted on extorting N100 from him, but he refused. He even resisted that his bike must not be impounded, but after they forcefully took it from him, he started pestering them, leading the policeman to warn him saying he would shoot him if he continued following him, and eventually, he shot him. “The man is an Abakaliki man, and after he was shot, his people mobilized and attacked the police station in Igboukwu,” the eyewitness narrated. It was gathered that the protesters who first set the Igboukwu police station on fire did not stop there, they moved to Ekwulobia, a neighbouring community to Igboukwu, where they burnt down the police station, while also destroying another at Ula and Oko communities, respectively, bringing the number of destroyed police stations to four, a source said revealed, The state government had assured that Justice would be done, while the state police command, CP John Abang revealed that the policeman involved has been arrested.

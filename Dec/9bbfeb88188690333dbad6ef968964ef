Gunmen suspected to be kidnapers on Tuesday struck again on the Benin-Auchi road and abducted unspecified number of passengers. The ‎gunmen were said to have attacked an Abuja bound commercial bus traveling from Benin between Ehor and Iruekpen. According to sources, several of the passengers “were forcefully taken into the bush‎”. Recall gunmen held siege to this same road December 3 and took a reasonable number of passengers hostage. Spokesperson of E‎do State Police Command, SP Chidi Nwabuzor, could not respond to calls and SMS sent to his mobile phone.

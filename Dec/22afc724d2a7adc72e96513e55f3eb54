The prosecutor, Insp Chidi Leo, told the court that Yusuf committed the offence at his residence on Nov. 30. According to the prosecutor, the girl’s mother had sent her on an errand when the defendant lured her to his room. He said the girl’s mother was in search of her daughter when she heard her screaming in an uncompleted building and saw Yusuf on top of her.

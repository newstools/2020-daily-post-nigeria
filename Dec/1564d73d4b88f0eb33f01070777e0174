All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Bola Tinubu, has urged Nigerians to let kindness reign. In his Christmas message on Thursday, the former Lagos State Governor urged everyone to be more tolerant of others. Tinubu stressed that December 25 is a day to be thankful for. The politician urged all to act in the spirit and teachings of Jesus Christ. He appealed to Nigerians to celebrate in moderation and adhere to all COVID-19 protocols. “Christmas is a celebration of life and this year we best celebrate life by doing what we must do to protect ourselves and our loved ones from this terrible virus. “Yet, we also must take solace in the fact that nothing, not even this virus, can rob us of the spirit of Christmas and the hope and brotherly love it represents. “With the emergence of the coronavirus, 2020 has been as a plane flying through turbulent skies, a year that has raised challenges like no other year has.” Tinubu noted that in normal times, Christmas offered Nigerians of all faiths an opportunity to gather with family and friends to celebrate the birth of Jesus. “Unfortunately, COVID came to steal much from us. But if we act in the spirit of Jesus, we shall defeat this disease and the other ills it seeks to impose on us.” Tinubu wished all Nigerians a peaceful and prosperous Christmas.

Wife of Architect, Alaramma Abubakar Muhammad Adam, who was Kidnapped while travelling from Gombe to Kaduna has given birth to triplets. Although nothing has been heard from the victim since his abduction, his wife reportedly went into early labour, two days after his abduction out of fear. Muhammad Adam was abducted by gunmen on Sunday, December 6, while travelling from Gombe to Kaduna after participating in a Qur’an recitation competition. A Personal Assistant to the Speaker of the Kaduna State House of Assembly and Auditor General of APC in Rigachikun Ward, Al’ameen Muhammad Sameen, who confirmed the latest development said Adam’s wife gave birth to three healthy boys. According to him, “God is great, there is moon and moon!!! Alhamdulillah, I just received the news of my sister’s daughter that she put to bed triplets. She is the wife of Alaramma Arc Abubakar Muhammad. She has given birth to three sons, all of them are healthy, we hope Allahu Subhanahu Wata ‘ Allah.” He said. “May God protect the children from these wicked people. Amen. Amen. Please continue to pray for us” he wrote. Kidnapping has become a daily routine in Kaduna and its environs. Hundreds and millions of Naira are often demanded before victims are released while others are killed even after ransom has been paid.

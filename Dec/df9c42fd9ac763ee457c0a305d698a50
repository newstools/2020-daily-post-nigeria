Former Chelsea defender, William Gallas, has urged Arsenal to hire Patrick Vieira if they sack Mikel Arteta. Arteta is overseeing a poor run of form at the Emirates, with the Gunners sitting in 15th place ahead of Saturday’s trip to Everton. Pressure is, however, mounting on the Spaniard and Gallas, who himself is a former Arsenal captain and feels Arteta is out of his depth. The Frenchman is keen to see another club legend Vieira, who was recently sacked by Nice, back at the club. “Patrick has more experience than Mikel because he’s managed in America and he spent time at Nice. So when the Arsenal board decided to pick a new manager I thought Patrick would get the call. “He was captain of Arsenal and he knows the club very well. Patrick was the right guy then. If they have to sack Mikel Arteta, they have to choose Patrick Vieira to replace him, and I’m sure all the fans would love it,” Gallas told Ladbrokes.

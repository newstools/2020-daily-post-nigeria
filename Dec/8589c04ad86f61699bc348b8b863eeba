Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has named Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola and Spain national team coach, Luis Enrique, as the two best managers in the world. Messi said both Guardiola and Enrique made him grow a lot physically, mentally, and tactically. The Argentine captain played under Guardiola and Enrique during their time at Barcelona between 2008-2012 and 2014-2017 respectively. “Pep [Guardiola] has something special,” Messi told Spanish Television channel, La Sexta. “He makes you see things in one way: how he prepares for matches, defensively, how to attack … he told you exactly how the match was going to be, how you had to attack to win. “I was lucky … to train under Guardiola and Luis Enrique, the two best [managers in the world]. “Having them made me grow a lot physically and mentally, and also the tactical wisdom they have taught me.”

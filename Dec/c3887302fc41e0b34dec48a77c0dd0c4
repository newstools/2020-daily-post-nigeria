The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has warned Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State about attempt to frustrate his political assignment. Primate Ayodele said Obaseki should wake up because he foresees his political assignment being frustrated by his enemies in the State. The popular prophet advised the governor and his deputy not to allow “discrepancies, and kangaroo court judgments to be used to oust them out of their administration.” He stated this in a statement he forwarded to DAILY POST. Primate Ayodele said the enemies were doing everything to get Obaseki out of the way, and “to disqualify his ability to move Edo forward.” “Obaseki must wake up, they want to bring his government down, he must not sleep so that they will not use kangaroo court judgment against him. “He and his deputy must not allow discrepancies, they must take every step so they won’t give them a shock. “His political enemies are waiting for his downfall, he should take the right step now before it’s too late, they want to frustrate his political assignment, they are looking for every means to disqualify his ability to move Edo forward. “He must not joke with this before it’s too late, they want to do everything to get him out of the way, he should not let it be too late,” Primate Ayodele said.

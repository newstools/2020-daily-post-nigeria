Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has described the death of Prof. Habu Galadima, the Director-General of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS), Kuru, near Jos, as a “great loss” to Nigeria. Lalong said this in a statement issued by his Director of Press and Public Affairs (DOPA), Dr Makut Macham, in Jos. He also said that the demise of Galadima was a huge loss to his immediate family, NIPSS, Plateau and Nasarawa States. According to him, the deceased would be greatly missed by the academic community in Nigeria and the diaspora. Galadima died on Sunday at the age of 57, after a brief illness. “Prof. Galadima is an astute scholar of international repute, administrator and professional who demonstrated uncommon commitment in carrying out every responsibility he was assigned,” Lalong said. “Since he assumed office one year ago, Galadima had injected a fresh impetus in the management of the nation’s apex policy and strategic institution by introducing new concepts that made research seamless even under the current COVID-19 pandemic. “He did a lot to improve the physical infrastructure of the institution while strengthening the academic experience for all course participants. He will be greatly missed. “The late erudite scholar has over the years contributed a lot to the educational development of Plateau, having studied and taught at the University of Jos for many years before his appointment as the DG of NIPSS,” he added. Lalong prayed God to grant his soul eternal rest and comfort his family, the management and staff of NIPSS.

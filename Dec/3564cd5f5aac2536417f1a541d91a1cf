Three suspected Yahoo boys have been nabbed by the police for allegedly gang-raping a teenager at gunpoint in Ogun State. Police said the three young men who confessed to the crime said they committed the heinous act thinking the police no longer work in Nigeria. The suspects were identified by the Ogun Police Command as Tunde Sadiq Taiwo, 22; Damilola Adesina, 20 and Adegoke Amos, 21. They were arrested on December 5 for “raping an 18-year-old girl” (name withheld). DAILY POST learned that the victim had reported at Ilese divisional police headquarters, Ijebu-Ode, Ogun State, that while she was going somewhere around Ita-Ale area of Ilese, she was accosted by three young men riding in a Lexus ES 350 car.” The teenager had told the police that she was forcefully dragged into the car and driven away to Rationwa area, where the guys allegedly took turns to rape her at gunpoint. “On the strength of the report, the DPO of Ilese division, SP Yakubu Bala, mobilised his men and stormed their hideout, where one of the suspects was arrested. The arrested one led the police to the other two and they were subsequently arrested,” police said. Confirming the incident to DAILY POST on Tuesday, Abimbola Oyeyemi, the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, said the suspects admitted committing the crime. “On interrogation, they confessed committing the crime, they claimed to have believed that the police are no longer working, hence they can do anything they like. But they were surprised when police came after them. The state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has ordered the transfer of the suspects to the state CIID. The CP also warned criminals who have the erroneous belief that the police has been subdued to be careful, warning that they will meet their waterloo in no distant time.

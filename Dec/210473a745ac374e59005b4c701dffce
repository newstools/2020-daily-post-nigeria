The Nigeria Police Force said their men arrested two members of a trans-national kidnap syndicate involved in the kidnap of an American Citizen, Philippe Nathan Walton. Recall that US forces on Saturday rescued 27-year-old Walton after he was taken hostage by armed men in Niger Republic and held in the northern part of Nigeria. However, the Force spokesperson DSP Frank Mba, in a statement on Thursday, said the suspects, Aliyu Abdullahi, 21,and Aliyu Umaru, 23, were arrested on 25th November, 2020. “The two suspects who are members of a 15-man kidnap gang of Nigerian extraction, led by Barte Dan Alhaji and Dan Buda were arrested following a special intelligence-led operation aimed at arresting the criminal gang. “Investigations by the Intelligence Response Team revealed that the gang was plotting other abductions to avenge the death of their cohorts who died during the rescue operations. “Meanwhile, as part of efforts at tackling transnational crimes, the Inspector General of Police, IGP M.A Adamu, is working with other members of the West African Police Chiefs Organization (WAPCO) to strengthen security along the international borders of member States. “The suspects will be arraigned in court once investigations are over,” he said.

The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) says, no fewer than 20 doctors have died of Coronavirus in the country in the last one week. NMA Chairman in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Dr. Emma Amodu disclosed this at a press briefing on Friday in Abuja. According to him, these doctors lost their lives after contracting the deadly disease while treating infected patients who failed to disclose their true health status. He pleaded with patients visiting clinics and hospitals not to conceal their true health status to avoid exposing medical practitioners to the risk of infection. He said, “For those of us in the health sector, we have lost quite a number of colleagues in the last week alone. Across the country, we have lost not less than 20 doctors in the last one week.” He called on visitors to hospitals and clinics to always adhere to COVID-19 protocols which include wearing of face masks. “Tell us the truth about your past medical condition and don’t hold any information back,” he added.

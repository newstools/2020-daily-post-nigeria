Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has expressed his delight with Paul Pogba’s performance in their 3-2 win over Sheffield United on Thursday. Pogba assisted Anthony Martial’s goal at Bramall Lane, as the Red Devils became the fourth side in English top-flight history to win 10 consecutive away league wins. Only Alex Telles (96) took more touches than Pogba (91). The France international also won three of his six aerial duels and gained possession eight times. Solskjaer has now hailed Pogba, who has been linked with a move away from the Premier League giants. “Of course, we know [Pogba’s] strength in the air. “We knew he was going to be important for us. He won almost every single header. “His vision, creativity. Paul’s responded really well to the work he’s been doing. He’s fit now. Excellent performance,” Solskjaer told the media.

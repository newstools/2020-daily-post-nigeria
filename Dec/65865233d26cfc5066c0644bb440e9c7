Mike Ejiofor, one-time Director of the Department of State Services, has accused Katsina State Governor, Aminu Masari and his Zamfara counterpart, Bello Matawalle of laying the foundation for kidnapping. Ejiofor explained that both Masari and Matawalle laid the foundation for kidnapping in their states by negotiating with bandits. He spoke while appearing on Channels Television’s programme, Sunrise Daily. The former DSS Director noted that government should strengthen security structure, rather than negotiate with bandits. According to Ejiofor: “The state governments –both Zamfara and Katsina States –mistakenly laid the foundation for what is going on now; they started negotiation with the bandits who were not even ready to give up on their activities and this is what we are witnessing now. “Even this Kankara incident, the governor came out to say they are negotiating, that is unacceptable. And you give these people the boldness and courage to continue to perpetrate this act.” Ejiofor charged the federal government to “take decisive actions” against bandits operating in the North-West. He stressed that money made from kidnapping and banditry are used in buying arms to further terrorize the country. Recall that Matawalle had said the abducted students of the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara were released through the help of repentant bandits

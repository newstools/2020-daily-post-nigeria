Everton have been relatively impressed under Carlo Ancelotti and they are placed second in the table after beating Sheffield United last time out. They are just three points adrift of Merseyside rivals Liverpool and their run of wins in a row has defined their surge up to the EPL log. The Italian boss Carlo Ancelotti has no fresh injury concerns ahead of the Manchester City duel. Though he will make do without six of his key players. The major players to be missing out here include Allan, James Rodriguez, Lucas Digne and Richarlison while Jean-Philippe Gbamin and Fabian Delph are relatively sidelined for this match. The unavailability of the four important players could see the Toffees approach the game with a defensive platform. With Lucas Digne not available, Ben Godfrey should take up the left-back role, though Seamus Coleman could return to the starting eleven to feature at the right back. Yerry Mina and Michael Keane should continue as Everton defensive pair in the central defence while goalkeeper Jordan Pickford should keep his place in goal. In the midfield, Tom Davies should partner Abduolaye Duocoure in, pivot with the two sitting behind to stifle what Kevin De Bruyne may be trying to make out for his side in transition. Gylfi Sigurdsson will continue on the number 10 role looking to pull the string for his side in the attacking third. With the match coming too early for James Rodriguez (Colombia) and Richarlison (Brazil), Alex Iwobi and Bernard are expected to feature in their stead on both flanks. In the attack, the in-form top scorer Dominic Calvert-Lewin should spearhead the charge for goals for his Everton side. Everton probable eleven against Manchester City in a 4-2-3-1 Formation Scheme. Jordan Pickford; Seamus Coleman, Michael Keane, Yerry Mina, Ben Godfrey; Abdoulaye Duocoure; Ben Davies; Alex Iwobi, Gylfi Sigurdsson, Bernard; Dominic Calvert-Lewin.

Retired Chief Superintendent of Police, Carol Afegbai, on Wednesday, dragged the Edo State Judicial Panel of Inquiry for victims of SARS and related abuses before a Benin High Court, challenging its right of compelling her to appear before them. The panel had on December 1, ordered the immediate arrest of CSP Carol Afegbai (rtd) for failing to appear before it to explain her alleged complicity in the murder of a 500 level student of University of Benin, Ibrahim Momodu, the only son of his parent who was murdered in 2013. At the resumed hearing, chairman of the panel, Justice Ada Ehigiamusoe told Jefferson Uwoghiren, counsel to the family of late Ibrahim Momodu that they (panel) have been served a court paper from the High Court restraining them from inviting CSP Carol Afegbai before it. Ehigiamusoe said the panel would honour the summon to show to other Nigerians that they have respect for the judicial system of the country. Counsel to the late Ibrahim Momoduâ€™s family, Jefferson Uwoghiren, saw the action of CSP Carol Afegbai as an ambush as he queried that he was not being served the court application.

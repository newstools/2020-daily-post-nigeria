Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta’s problem with Mesut Ozil, is his inability to play on the flanks, according to Goal. Arteta decided at the start of this season to leave Ozil out of his Premier League and Europa League squads. The Gunners have been struggling without the German, who is their best-paid player, earning a mouthwatering £350,000-a-week. Arsenal are crying out for a creative outlet, and it seems absurd that Arteta would leave Ozil out of his plans without a back-up. The club was linked with Philippe Coutinho in the summer transfer window, and Arteta was keen to bring the Brazilian to London. But Coutinho had just won the Champions League on loan at Bayern Munich, and Barcelona decided early on in the summer they wanted to give the midfielder a second chance. Arteta’s inability to get Coutinho meant Arsenal were always going to be without a creative player, if the Spaniard decided to freeze out Ozil. He however stuck with his decision, as he wanted a midfielder with the ability to play in a number of roles.

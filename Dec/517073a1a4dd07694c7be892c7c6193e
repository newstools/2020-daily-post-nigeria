Former Borno State Governor, Senator Kashim Shettima, has said that it is too early for the All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders, to talk about which region of the country will be given the party’s presidential slot in 2023. Shettima stated that President Muhammadu Buhari, the APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and other leaders of the APC will resolve the zoning issue in due time. He noted this while speaking during a two-day mid-term retreat held in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. Shettima appeared alongside the Minister of Works, Babatunde Fashola, and vowed that the ruling party will not disintegrate over the choice for presidential ticket. “Don’t forget that our party still controls the Presidency. We have a leader and other competent leaders that can manage every crisis situation. “At the appropriate time, our leaders will sit and take the most apt decision that will resolve the issue. “APC is a party that is united and nothing can break us. I am confident that we will win the 2023 presidential election. APC still remains the party to beat because of the unity of purpose and togetherness as well as desire to deliver for Nigerians. “So, I am confident and no cause for alarm, what you called controversy will be resolved in the fullest of time,” Shettima assured.

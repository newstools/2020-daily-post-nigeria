Barcelona has reacted to their UEFA Champions League round of 16 draws against Paris Saint-Germain. Barcelona’s Director of Institutional Relations, Guillermo Amor, said the La Liga giants know PSG well, adding that the French Ligue 1 champions want to fight for the Champions League title this season. According to Amor, Barcelona has what it takes to match PSG. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Barcelona would tackle PSG in the Champions League last 16. “We know them [Paris] well, they have got some exceptional players,” UEFA’s official website quoted Amor as saying after the draw in Nyon on Monday afternoon. “Paris want to fight for the Champions League, last year they came very close to winning it, and they want to go one better this time around, but we have got something to say about that.” The Round of 16 matches will be played in February 2021.

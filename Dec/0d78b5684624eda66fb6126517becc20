The Football Association(FA) has charged Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani, for a now-deleted Instagram post. Cavani put up the post, after scoring twice as a substitute in United’s 3-2 win over Southampton on November 29. The 33-year-old responded to a post from a friend on Instagram by writing ‘Gracias negrito’, which translates as ‘Thanks, little black’. Cavani has now been charged with misconduct and has until Monday, January 4, 2021, to provide a response. “It is alleged that, contrary to FA Rule E3.1, a comment posted on the Manchester United FC player’s Instagram page was insulting and/or abusive and/or improper and/or brought the game into disrepute. “It is further alleged that the comment constitutes an ‘Aggravated Breach’, which is defined in FA Rule E3.2, as it included a reference, whether express or implied, to colour and/or race and/or ethnic origin,” an FA statement read. If Cavani accepts the charge, he could be set for a lengthy ban. The Uruguayan is currently recovering from injury and will miss Thursday night’s trip to Sheffield United.

Zamfara State Governor, Bello Muhammed Matawalle has described as unfortunate, social media narratives accusing his policy of dialoguing with bandits of escalating violent attacks in the northwest. Following the abduction of school children in Kankara, Katsina State, the social media had gone agog with viral comments accusing Matawalle of aiding and abetting criminals. But the Zamfara Governor said his policy of peace accord has brought some semblance of peace to his state. A statement signed by the Special Adviser on media and public enlightenment to Mattawalle, Hon. Zailani Bappa said the social media blame game which surfaced online was an echo of Governor Bello Aminu Masari’s comments on the matter. Hon. Zailani Bappa’s statement read “This is an echo of what Governor Bello Aminu Masari earlier said of the escalating attacks in his own state” ”Governor Matawalle believes that attack anywhere in the North West, and indeed, the whole country is unfortunate, abominable and condemnable. “However, it is very uncharitable to blame Zamfara State government’s peace accord which has brought some semblance of peace to Zamfara State” “Governor Matawalle has more than once in the past, called on his colleagues in the region to copy his initiative at brokering genuine peace with the bandits and try to settle them to normal life. Indeed, even Katsina State Governor tried it but later abandoned it” “It is very unfortunate that such accusations are coming at a time when the governor is doing everything possible to assist in the release of these innocent children” The statement said Mattawalle will not join issues with anyone but called on all his colleagues to embrace dialogue with the carrot and stick approach, as according to him, it remains the best option for lasting peace in the region, He warned, however, that the dialogue must be truthful, genuine and honest.

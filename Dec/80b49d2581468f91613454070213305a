The Minister of Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, said Nigerian youths deserved commendation for embarking on the End SARS protest nationwide. According to him, the protests, though hijacked by hoodlums, awakened the nation from its lethargy and consciousness to what was bedeviling the nation. Aregbesola spoke at Dioceses of Ijesa North, Anglican Communion, Ijebu-jesa, Osun State on Friday. He said, “The youth must be commended for organising a protest that woke the nation from its lethargy and roused our consciousness to the situation in which we found ourselves. These youth are a blessing to any society just as they can be the purveyor of evil, if their energy is not properly channelled. Aregbesola addressed the youths as “the generation of social media and the power of ideas and intellect” and a peculiar breed. He said that the deployment of their intelligence is a different matter, which the government must seek to re-channel through positive modelling, mentoring, retraining and ultimately gainful employment. “The reports and pictures of assaults, killings, looting, arson and barefaced robberies should fill us all with shame and the deepest embarrassment. “There was once a time when roadside traders left their wares unattended and were sure no one would steal them. “We have regrettably seen after the protests that all the efforts of a century can be wiped out in a day, which will require not less than 50 years to recover from. “That is why security, coordination and management of protests and how we protest, should be well thought out and moderated,” he said.

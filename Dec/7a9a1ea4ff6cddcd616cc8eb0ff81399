The Vice-Chancellor, Ekiti State University, Prof. Eddy Olanipekun has appealed to parents to pay their children’s tuition for the institution to gain financial strength to execute beneficial projects on campus. Prof Olanipekun made the appeal in Ado Ekiti on Monday, during a press conference to kick off the 24th convocation ceremonies of the university. He said the students owe the institution tuition amounting to N2 billion. The VC expressed regret that the COVID-19 pandemic and the high debt owed by the institution have caused a slump in the university’s financial stand. He said: “Our students are owing N2 billion being outstanding tuition fee yet to be paid into the university’s coffers. “As part of the ways to recover the debt, the university is going to generate institutional e-mails to all students where we can interface. But if you are owing, there is no way you can interface with lecturers. We are using this as Online and physical teaching methodologies. You can’t interact with your lecturers or supervisors either for lecture or seminar as a debtor. “We are appealing to parents to please pay for their children to help our financial situation”.

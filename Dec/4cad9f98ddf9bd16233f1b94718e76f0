Nigerian Gay activist, Bisi Alimi has revealed he tested positive for HIV 16 years ago. Alimi disclosed this on his Instagram page while celebrating World AIDS Day. Narrating his experience, Alimi said the first four years was tough for him after he was diagnosed with HIV because of the stigma and the discrimination he faced at the time. However, he’s been able to overcome all of that following the support and love from the people close to him. His post read: “It has been 16yrs since I tested positive for HIV. 16yrs I have been living with the virus. The first 4yrs was hard and tough for me, not because of the virus, but because of the stigma and the discrimination and shame. “But I look back at those 16yrs and where I am today and there is no better way to say this; the resilience and support and love of the people that matter has kept me alive, kept loving, and kept me inspired.” He encouraged those living with the virus to stay positive, adding that living with HIV is not a death sentence.

Member of the House of Representatives, Danjuma Shiddi (APGA, Taraba) has defected to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Announcing his defection on Tuesday in Abuja, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rep Femi Gbajabiamila, said Shiddi attributed his defection to division in his former party. According to Gbajabiamila, Shiddi’s defection was because of uncertainty propelled by division in the party. He, however, said that such division wouldn’t allow Shiddi to further his political aspiration. Shiddi represents Ibi/Wukari Federal Constituency of Taraba.

Rev. Tajan Moltok has condemned the use of sex toys. NAN reports that in his ‘Understanding the Anointing’ sermon on Sunday, the cleric described it as a perversion of nature. Moltok is the Resident Pastor of Shepherd House Assembly International in Jos, Plateau State. He said the act was a sin of lawlessness and degeneration of morality. “This act reminds God of Sodom and Gomorrah. Masturbation is becoming a lifestyle, people do not have control over their sexual urges. Do not give Satan a chance.” Moltok added that the church must return to God and be sanitised to live right to His glory. “The church must come back to God. You cannot be in church and you are keeping malice with someone for one year. The anointing will give you a forgiving spirit.” Moltok stressed that God’s anointing would renew believers’ strength and empower them to be victorious against their enemies.

Diego Costa’s contract with Atletico Madrid has been terminated by mutual consent ahead of the January transfer window. Atletico Madrid confirmed this in a statement on Tuesday. “Atlético de Madrid and Diego Costa have reached an agreement for the termination of the striker’s contract, which was to end on June 30, 2021,” Atletico Madrid’s statement read. “The striker asked to leave the club for personal reasons a few days ago and on Tuesday signed the termination of his contract. “The club thanks Diego Costa for his dedication during these years and wishes him well in the next stage of his professional career.” Costa, 32, had asked Atletico Madrid to terminate his contract early due to personal reasons. The former Chelsea striker whose deal with the La Liga giants was due to expire in June 2021, will be able to join a new team as a free agent in January.

The federal government has said that motorists who run their vehicles on auto-gas will spend less than those using Premium Motor Spirit, popularly called petrol. Recall that the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) had increased the ex-depot price of PMS, thereby leading to a hike in the pump price of petrol. The hike trailed a lot of reactions from Nigerians. The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) had filed a lawsuit against President Mohammadu Buhari, Vice-President Professor Yemi Osinbajo and the leadership of the National Assembly over the hike. SERAP asked that the Federal High Court to declare the hike in electricity tariff and fuel price by the Federal Government as ‘illegal’. However, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, during the inauguration of the auto-gas station of NNPC under the National Gas Expansion Program in Lugbe, Abuja on Tuesday noted that the auto-gas was a lot cheaper than the Premium Motor Spirit, also know as petrol. According to him, the auto-gas includes a Compressed Natural Gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas. “Vehicle operators should make use of this opportunity since its more economic and requires less expenditure. “We are also working out the price for auto-gas and I assure you that it is cheaper than PMS,” he added.

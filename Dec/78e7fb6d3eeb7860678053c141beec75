Pope Francis on Wednesday condemned the killing of farmers and villagers in northeast Nigeria by suspected Islamist militants. DAILY POST had reported that some farmers were killed on their rice fields at Zabarmari, in Jere Local Government of Borno State by Boko Haram insurgents. The terrorists beheaded the farmers on Saturday night in Zabarmari, less than 20 km from Maiduguri. Reacting, Pope during his weekly general audience, held virtually from his library in the Vatican described the unfortunate incident as a `terroristic massacre’ that offended the name of God. He also prayed that God grants peace and comfort to the families of the slain farmers.
“I want to assure my prayers for Nigeria, which unfortunately once again has been bloodied by a terroristic massacre.
“May God welcome them into his peace and comfort their families, and may he convert the hearts of those who commit such horrors, which gravely offend His name,’’ Francis said. —

Nigerian troops have again eliminated terrorists in Borno. Soldiers ambushed them on Tuesday at Tunkushe village, 20 kilometers from Maiduguri, the State capital. The insurgents were dressed in military uniforms and moved in two Hilux that had anti-aircraft guns. A military source told PRNigeria that they were suspected Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters. “They were repelled by the troops of 212 Battalion of the Nigerian Army in a heavy gunfight that lasted for more than 30 minutes. “While two soldiers were wounded, at least three dead bodies of the attackers were seen. Troops are pursuing fleeing terrorists”, he said. AK 47 rifles, buffen radio and various types of ammunition were recovered.

The Bishop of Sokoto Catholic Diocese, Matthew Kukah, has bemoaned the nepotism which he says has characterised President Muhammadu Buhari government and warned that although Christians will not fight back, but “God does not sleep”. Kukah, in his 2020 Christmas message, claimed there could have been a coup or war in the country if a non-Nothern Muslim becomes president and does some of the things Buhari has done. “Every honest Nigerian knows that there’s no way any non-Northern Muslim President could have done a fraction of what President Buhari has done by his nepotism and gotten away with it. “There would have been a military coup a long time ago or Nigeria would have been at war. “The President may have concluded Christians will do nothing and will live with his actions. “He may be right and Christians cannot feel sorry that we have no pool of violence to draw from or threaten this country. “However, God does not sleep. We can see from the inexplicable dilemma of his North,” Kukah said.

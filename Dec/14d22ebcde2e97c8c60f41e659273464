Professor Charles Adisa, Nigeria Christian Graduate Fellowship (NCGF), is dead. Rev. Samson Ayokunle, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) President, made the announcement on Tuesday. In a statement he signed, Ayokunle commiserated with the family, colleagues, friends, relatives, NCGF and Think Tank for the Body of Christ. “It was one death too many because nobody expected such a God’s General to depart from the scene when his contributions are still highly needed. Prof Adisa used his influence and position to speak for the Church in the country. “We cannot forget their contributions during the agitation for the restoration of Christian Religious Knowledge back to the public schools, CAN’s position on the controversial Ruga Settlements, Company Allied Matters Act (CAMA), lopsided appointments, etc. “Our consolation is that, for Christians, to die is gain. He served the Kingdom to the end and he has gone to his rewards”, Ayokunle said. The CAN leader added that Adisa’s home call was a challenge to everyone to be sincere in their service unto the Lord.

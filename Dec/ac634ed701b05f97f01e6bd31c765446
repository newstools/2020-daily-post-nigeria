The leadership crisis in the Kwara State All Progressives Congress, APC, deepened on Friday as party chieftains loyal to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq condemned the swearing-in of Bashir Bolarinwa by the Buni led National Caretaker Committee of the party. At a press conference held at the party secretariat in Ilorin, the group also condemned attempts to drag the governor into the crisis. “We condemn in strong terms the deliberate dragging of the state’s party leader, Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq.” The group said “The members who should know are intentionally misinforming the public to please their Abuja paymasters. It claimed that “The dissolved excos were never elected, they were rather imposed and we resisted the attempt to take us to the dark ages which we said ‘Otoge’ to. “We, therefore, affirm that the dissolved excos was a caretaker and thereby demand the constitution of a new set to be appointed as caretakers to bring peace back to the party,” the group declared. DAILY POST reports that the Bolarinwa led state working committee of the party, was sworn in at the Abuja national secretariat to pilot the affairs of the party till June 2021. Recall that the national executive of the party dissolved state executive committees of the party on December 8, 2020, and reconstituted the old excos.

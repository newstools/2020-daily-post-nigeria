Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has reacted to the abduction of students from Government Science Secondary School in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State. Adams said it was absurd that bandits abducted over 600 secondary school students during President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to Katsina State. Speaking shortly after his ordination as an Apostle at the Saviour’s Ministries on Sunday in Lagos State, Adams blamed President Buhari-led administration for the security situation in Nigeria. “There is no denying the fact that Nigeria is at a crossroads because the present situation in the country is a pointer to the fact that this government has failed,” Adams said. “How can you explain the abduction of about 600 students in a school? It is saddening to accept this as a parent, but also ridiculous as a leader who knows much about what it takes to lead a country like Nigeria. “The abduction happened in Katsina State, the country home of the president, where he was presently on a week-long visit. It is absurd. “The whole event is a justification of the failures of the present administration under Buhari and Nigeria is in for a long battle against insurgency.” Meanwhile, the Governor of Katsina State, Aminu Masari, on Sunday revealed that 333 students are missing following the bandits’ attack at the Government Science Secondary School in Kankara, in the early hours of Saturday.

As the crisis in the main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Jigawa State continues to take another dimension the court has issued a fresh order. This is following the conduct of the local Government Congress of the party by the Sule Lamido-led faction. A Jigawa State High court sitting in Dutse presided by Justice Musa Ubale issued the court order restricting the conduct of the PDP Local Government and State Congress. This was contained in a court order with suit No. JDU/41/2020 as obtained by DAILY POST. It arose from a suit filed by Bar. Ibrahim Aliyu, counsel to the faction of the party’s Gubernatorial candidate in 2015 and 2019 elections, Mallam Aminu Ibrahim Ringim, challenging the conduct of the Congress. He said the party had never conducted ward congress and as such there should be no other congress until delegates from wards were elected. Justice Ubale ordered an interim injunction restraining the defendants/respondents, their agents, privies or any other persons acting for and or on behalf of the defendants/respondents from conducting local government and state Congress as purportedly scheduled in the 1st defendants letter dated 14th December 2020. The Judge directed that the motion on notice is scheduled for 29th January 2021. Earlier, the former Governor of Jigawa State Alh Sule Lamido while speaking to journalists after the local Government Congress at Birnin Kudu local Government, said he was not aware of any court order. He said the local Government congress was conducted based on the National Working Committee’s directives. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-859609" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608213676632.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="1280" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608213676632.jpg 640w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608213676632-150x300.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608213676632-512x1024.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-859608" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608213667914.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="1280" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608213667914.jpg 640w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608213667914-150x300.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608213667914-512x1024.jpg 512w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px">

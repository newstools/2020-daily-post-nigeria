Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has admitted his team has been missing the creativity of Hakim Ziyech. Ziyech who is currently injured, might make his return in the Blues’ next scheduled game against Manchester City on Sunday. The Moroccan went off with a hamstring injury during Chelsea’s win over Leeds United on December 5. Ever since, Lampard’s men have won only one of their five league fixtures since then, losing three and drawing 1-1 on Monday with Aston Villa. “I think with Hakim, the way he was playing, he was being very effective for us in terms of assists, goal creation, chance creation and some goals,” Lampard said. “We were very fluid at the time. You’re going to miss players at that level when they drop out and we want him back.” Lampard said he is optimistic Ziyech might feature on Sunday if the game goes ahead – Manchester City’s game against Everton on Monday was called off due to new COVID-19 cases reported at City.

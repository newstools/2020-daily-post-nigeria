The Police in Sweden have detained a woman in her 70s for allegedly locking up her son. The victim in his early 40s was found on Sunday in a flat in Haninge after a relative informed the police. On Tuesday, Stockholm region police spokesman, Ola Osterling told dpa the man is in a hospital receiving treatment. He was malnourished, had lost his teeth and had large sores on his body. Aftonbladet and Expressen reported Monday night that he could have been held in the flat for almost 30 years. The Swedish Prosecution Authority is investigating the mother for illegal deprivation of liberty, causing gross bodily harm and causing illness. Emma Olsson, the prosecutor, said she had denied the allegations. “We will map the man’s life and circumstances and conduct a number of interviews”, Olsson said in a statement.

Arsenal is close to agreeing on a deal with Schalke for Sead Kolasinac, Sky Germany reports. The Bosnian defender is expected to complete a loan move back to his former club until the end of the season. Kolasinac has reportedly arrived in Germany and undergone his medicals. He will wear the no.20 shirt and become Schalkeâ€™s new captain. It is believed he has accepted a 50 per cent pay cut to make the deal possible. The Gunners are keen to move several players out of the squad in January, with Sokratis another who could leave before the end of the month. William Saliba, Reiss Nelson and Calum Chambers could follow Kolasinac out on loan, while Arsenal would be open to allowing Shkodran Mustafi to leave, should a suitable offer arrive.

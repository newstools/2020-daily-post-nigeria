Ahmed Musa could be set for a Premier League return, with West Bromwich Albion tipped to make a move for the free agent, according to West Brom News. The Super Eagles captain has been without a club after he left Saudi Pro League side, Al Nassr. Musa moved to Al Nassr from former English champions Leicester City on a four-year deal after the 2018 World Cup. In 58 appearances, he scored 11 goals and got 14 assists, while helping the team win the 2018/2019 Saudi top-flight diadem and the 2019 Saudi Super Cup. New West Brom manager, Sam Allardyce, is said to be a huge admirer of the Nigerian winger and might push for his signing with the side struggling to find the back of the net this season. The Baggies are currently 19th on the table with seven points and a -19 goal difference.

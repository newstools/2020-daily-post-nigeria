President Muhammadu Buhari, Tuesday, in Abuja revealed why the ruling party, All Progressives Congress (APC), is gaining more members and having some of its bigwigs who left for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, are returning to the ruling party. Buhari attributed the success of the party to the 13-member Caretaker/Extra-ordinary Convention Planning Committee of the party led by Governor Mai Mala Buni. Notably, Buhari acknowledged the recent decamp of Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State from the PDP to the APC. Buhari spoke at the virtual Emergency National Executive Council Meeting of the APC at the State House, Abuja on Tuesday. “Healthy debates are now taking place and the potential for organs of the party to affirm majority positions as the decision of the party is now possible,” Buhari noted. “Despite the challenge to restore peace in the party and the series of elections at hand, the fact that we have gained more members and that we are not losing members to the opposition under the present interim leadership indicates improvement for the party. “In fact, we have begun to win back our members who left us, and other notable political leaders are being attracted to our party. “In this regard, I hereby acknowledge the return of many party stalwarts and their supporters, and particularly, His Excellency, David Umahi, Governor of Ebonyi State. “This confirms that we are indeed making progress as a party of choice for Nigerians as we move towards the resolution of our leadership challenges.’’

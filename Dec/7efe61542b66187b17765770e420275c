A former Chelsea centre-back, Frank Leboeuf, has predicted Bayern Munich to win the Champions League this season. Bayern Munich, who will face Lazio in the Champions League last-16 in February 2021, won the Europe top-flight trophy last season after beating Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 in the final. “Who is going to win the Champions League [this season]? Bayern Munich, again,” Leboeuf told ESPN on Monday. Ex-West Ham goalkeeper, Shaka Hislop agreed, adding: “If I was going to put some money on someone to win the Champions League right now, I would still go Bayern Munich, you know.” “Again, it’s very hard to understand what happened to Manchester City,” Leboeuf added. “The way they played, in fact the way they did not want to play and the lethargy that we talked about in so many games we say with top teams. “That’s the main concern about every club, it’s not especially Manchester City, but we see nothing. “Nothing we can complain about, because they drew. They did not lose. When you’ve a bad game at least you draw. It can happen, it happens maybe too often but it happens.”

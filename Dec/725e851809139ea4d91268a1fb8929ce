Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has hinted Mesut Ozil could return to the squad in January. Ozil has not featured for the Gunners since March and is not included in the 25-man squads for both the Premier League and Europa League. The German’s deal is up at the end of this season and his Arsenal career seemed over, but Goal reports there may be another twist to come in the tale. “He’s not in the squad right now. I’m focusing just on the players we have here. “But, whatever happens in January, we have some time to decide,”Arteta told the press on Saturday ahead of a crunch Premier League clash with Burnley on Sunday.

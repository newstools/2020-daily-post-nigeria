The Federal Government on Tuesday directed civil servants from grade level 12 and below to stay at home. They are to remain at home for five weeks following the second wave of the COVID-19 disease in Nigeria. Head of Civil Service of the Federation, HOCSF, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, made this known in a circular in Abuja. He pointed out that the development was as a result of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 around in the country. The circular reads in part; “Following Mr President’s approval of recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, in the light of the second wave of the infection in Nigeria, officers on grade level 12 and below are hereby, directed to stay at home for a period of five weeks, effective from Wednesday Dec. 23 and await further directive,” the HOS said. The HoS said that the measure became imperative to streamline the number of officers who come to work daily. She said those affected by the directive are expected to work from home, while officers on grade level 13 and above are to adhere to preventive measures.

A Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC in Enugu State, Engr. Obinna Okorie has asked the party’s national body not to appoint any of the state’s factional Chairmen into the caretaker committee. Obinna said the lingering internal crisis in the Enugu branch of the party, would have been laid to rest if the National body had acted against Ben Nwonye and Deacon Okay Ogbodo, the two warring party leaders. He cautioned that only fresh hands, new party handlers will give the APC a stronger disposition in the state. He explained that retaining either of the two warring leaders will continue to plunge the party into deeper crises, as the party’s interest does not form parts of their day to day decisions. “Since Ben Nwonye ascended his position as factional leader of the Party in the state, he cannot boast of winning any elective office, not even the ward Counselorship. “To be fair to him, he prefers to frolic with the Governor and the PDP in the state than face his core business of expanding the party and winning elective offices,” he said. “The simple solution to this political impasse is to wash them away. They have failed the party in the state, and they are ready to do more harm to the party if given a similar advantage. “So I call on the National Caretaker Committee Chairman of the APC, Gov. Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State; Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama and Chief Ken Nnamani, APC caretaker committee chairman in the southeast to as a matter of urgency consider appointing fresh and independent minds to drive the party in the state,” he concluded.

The House of Representatives, on Tuesday, passed through second reading a bill to establish the Nigerian Health Infrastructure Development Bank. The bill sponsored by Mansur Soro and Femi Gbajabiamila, if passed into law, will establish that bank, which will have the mandate to boost local healthcare capacity. Leading the debate on the bill, Soro said the bill seeks to ensure the provision of quality, efficient and affordable healthcare services for Nigerians. He noted that budgetary allocation to healthcare is not sufficient to address the healthcare needs of Nigerians. “The bill aims to ensure a qualitative healthcare system for Nigerians as the covid-19 pandemic has exposed the weak healthcare structure of the nation,” he stated. He also said that “the proposed bank would help save the dilapidated situation and channel funds for specialized healthcare development.” The bill was referred to the Committee on Health Institutions.

Paris Saint-Germain has sacked Thomas Tuchel as their manager. The dismissal comes only four months after he led the French champions to the Champions League final, where they lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich. Tuchel, 47, leaves the Parc des Princes after two-and-a-half years in charge. The German won six trophies with the Ligue 1 outfit, including back-to-back league titles. But Wednesday night’s 4-0 win over Strasbourg was the end of the road, despite PSG being third in the French league, just one point off top spot. Before the game, Tuchel had given an interview in his homeland, in which he was quoted as saying he had, at times, felt more like “a sports politician or sports minister than a coach” during his tenure. Former Tottenham Hotspur coach, Mauricio Pochettino, is now the top favourite for the role.

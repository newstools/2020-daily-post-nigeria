Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has blocked defender, Rhys Williams, from leaving Anfield on loan in the January transfer window. Williams was handed his senior debut at Liverpool in September. The 19-year-old, who is wanted by several Championship clubs, including Middlesbrough, has made nine first-team appearances in all competitions for Liverpool. According to The Sun, Klopp has now decided to keep Williams at the Reds following his impressive performances in recent weeks for the Premier League champions as long-term injuries, Virgil van Dijk and Joe Gomez are yet to return to the squad. Williams was solid in the Champions League and was outstanding on his Premier League debut earlier this week as Liverpool defeated Tottenham 2-1 at Anfield. The youngstar spent last season on loan at Kidderminster Harriers in the National League North.

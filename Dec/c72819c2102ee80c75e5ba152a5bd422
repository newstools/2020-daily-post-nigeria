The Defence Headquarters, DHQ, has said the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole has destroyed some residents of Boko Haram leaders in Sambisa forest and Yale areas of Borno State. DHQ disclosed that several terrorists were killed during the separate air strikes on Monday. The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, NAN reports. Enenche said the air raids were carried out after credible intelligence and a series of aerial surveillance missions. According to him, this indicated that some terrorists that carried out recent attacks against innocent civilians were harboured in makeshift structures in the areas. He said that the military dispatched Nigerian Air Force fighter jets and helicopter gunships to attack the two locations. “The attack aircraft, while taking turns to engage the targets, delivered lethal bomb and rocket strikes, resulting in the destruction of some of the structures and the killing of several terrorists,” he said.

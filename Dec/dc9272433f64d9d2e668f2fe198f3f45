A former Real Madrid and Liverpool player, Michael Owen, has predicted that Chelsea will play a draw with Sevilla when both sides clash in tonight’s Champions League fixture in Spain. Owen also backed Manchester United to secure a win against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday night at Old Trafford. “With both sides home and dry in terms of qualification to the next phase, this is basically a shoot-out for the top spot,” Owen told BetVictor. “It was 0-0 when the sides met at Stamford Bridge on matchday 1, but since then both have been amongst the goals. Interestingly, there have been over 2.5 goals in 7 of Chelsea’s last 8 UEFA Champions League matches. “I think this will be tight. I cannot help but cast my mind back to their fixture on matchday 1 when there was absolutely nothing between the sides. So, I’ll be siding with the draw again.” Commenting on the Man United vs PSG game, Owen said, “Manchester United go into this match knowing that a point will be enough to take them through to the next round. “I’m sure that Sunday’s marvelous comeback away to Southampton will still have the players on a high. “That’s good news for Ole Gunnar Solkjaer after he endured a lot of criticism over the last few weeks. “PSG managed to get a vital 1-0 win over Leipzig last week, so they’ll be looking to another victory here to ensure they give themselves the best chance of progression to the next stage. “Again, this is another tight one to call. However, with United back in good form, I think they can take all 3 points and secure qualification.” The kick-off time for all the games is 9 pm, Nigerian time.

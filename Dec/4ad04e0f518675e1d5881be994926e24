Manchester United Executive Vice-Chairman, Ed Woodward, has promised to bankroll Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s spending in the summer transfer window. Woodward has come out publicly to back Solskjaer on many occasions over the past two years, even amid growing speculations the club is considering replacing him with former Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino. Solskjaer has spent £180 million since the summer of 2019, which is more than any other club in European football. And United’s spending is set to continue, as Woodward has vowed to hand him even more cash. “I told this forum back in April that we remained committed to strengthening the squad while being disciplined in our spending during the pandemic. “I believe we’ve delivered on that, with the additions we made during the summer taking our total net spending to over €200million (£180m) since summer 2019 – more than any other major European club over that period. “We will continue to support Ole with a planned, long-term approach to recruitment, focused on the summer windows,” Woodward said in a fans’ forum meeting held virtually with Manchester United supporters. United are away to West Ham this weekend, hoping to bounce back from a 3-1 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday.

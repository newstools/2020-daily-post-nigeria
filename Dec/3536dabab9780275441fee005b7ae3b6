Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud, has reacted to their 4-0 win over Spanish side, Sevilla in the Champions League on Wednesday. Giroud put up an impeccable performance by scoring all four goals and afterwards described the occasion as a ‘good night’. Giroud goals last night helped the Blues wrap up top spot in their Champions League group with a game to spare. The Frenchman scored a perfect hat-trick before adding a penalty to round off his sensational evening. And that was a clear message to Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard who has preferred England international, Tammy Abraham in that No. 9 position. When asked for his thoughts on his own performance, Giroud told BT Sport, “Well, yeah, when you win 4-0 in the Champions League away game, it’s always a good feeling. “We took the game from the front foot and we were efficient up front. It was a good night and also for me because I scored four goals.

Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for the kidnap of students from Government Science school, Kankara, Katsina State. The terror group’s leader, Abubakar Shekau, made this known in a 4:28 long recording released in the wee hours of Tuesday and obtained by HumAngle. Shekau said the boys were kidnapped to promote Islam and discourage western education. “What happened in Katsina was done to promote Islam and discourage un-Islamic practices as Western education is not the type of education permitted by Allah and his Holy Prophet,” Shekau said. According to him, “The school is not teaching what Allah and his Holy Prophet commanded. They are rather destroying Islam.” The Boko Haram leader noted that though their actions may be subtle, “Allah the Lord of the skies and earth knows whatever is hidden. May Allah promote Islam. May we die as Muslims.” “In a nutshell, we are behind what happened in Katsina,” Shekau added. Meanwhile, the federal government has assured that the students would be rescued soon.

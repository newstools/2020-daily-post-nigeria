A Federal High Court in Lagos on Monday sentenced a 28-year-old man, Lateef Agboola, to six months imprisonment for trafficking in Cannabis. NAN reports that Agboola, who was arraigned by the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), pleaded not guilty before Justice Chukwujekwu Aneke. The prosecutor, Mr Jeremiah Aernan, asked the court to grant his request for a scientific aid form, a drug analysis form and remnants of Cannabis, among other items. Aernan said that Agboola was arrested on a tip-off at Ile-mere Ibese in Ikorodu, Lagos, while unlawfully dealing on Cannabis weighing 250g He also prayed the court to convict the accused. According to him, the offence contravenes the provisions of Section 11(c) of the NDLEA Act of 2004. However, the judge while delivering judgement found Agboola guilty as charged and sentenced him. Aneke held that the sentence should take effect from the date of Agboolaâ€™s arrest. The judge also gave the convict an option of N200,000 fine.

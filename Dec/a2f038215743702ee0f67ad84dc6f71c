President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the death of Nigerian doctors killed by COVID-19. A statement on Saturday by Garba Shehu, presidential spokesman, disclosed that Buhari has sent his condolence to the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) over the loss. The Nigerian leader said their death was painful because they risked their lives in order to save others. “Our health workers are making maximum sacrifices for the country in line with their humanitarian calling, and this administration will leave no stone unturned in order to ensure their needs are met. “Let me say without any fear of contradiction that no reward is too much for the sacrifices of our health workers in the country, and this administration will give their welfare the priority it deserves,” Buhari added. Garba said the President also mourned the demise of the Galadiman Lokoja, Godwin Ajakpo, and the chairman of Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), Air Commodore Idongesit Nkanga (Rtd), a former military Governor.

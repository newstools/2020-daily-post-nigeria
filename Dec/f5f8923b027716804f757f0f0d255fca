The factional chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo State, Daniel Nwafor has insisted that his leadership remains legitimate in the state, especially with a pending court judgement from a competent jurisdiction. The dissolution as announced by the National Caretaker Committee, according to him, has no effect in Imo State. This, he said, is because the matter is currently in the Supreme Court, where it was taken by the APC National body after being defeated at the court of Appeal. He continued, “We call on the Governor Mai Mala Buni led National Caretaker Committee to lead NY example and obey the court of Appeal judgement which reaffirmed us as the legitimate executives of the party in Imo State. “We are not ready to abandon the mandate given to us by party faithful unless the Supreme Court rules otherwise. “We urge all members of our party and supporters to continue to be law-abiding and function in their various capacities.” Nwafor further advised the Nlemigbo-led executive to stop arrogating powers to themselves, insisting that he was in
charge.

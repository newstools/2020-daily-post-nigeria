The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has again lost a member in the House of Representatives, Sam Onuigbo to the All Progressives Congress (PDP). This is the fourth member of the PDP to dump the party for the ruling APC within the week. It would be recalled that Datti Yako on Tuesday moved from PDP to the APC, while Danjuma Shittu from Taraba State dumped the All Progressives Congress Alliance for the APC. On Wednesday, Tajudeen Adefisoye moved from the Social Democratic Party to the APC. Onuigbo who represents Ikwuano/Umuahia federal constituency of Abia State in a letter read on the floor of the House by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila on Thursday, cited “division” as the reason for his defection. The Minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu in what has become a customary protest cited Section 68 of the 1999 constitution, calling on the Speaker to declare the seat vacant.

The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has alleged that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government may trample upon the rights of freedom of movement and association of Nigerians, in 2021. HURIWA said there are signs that the Buhari-led government would deliberately activate some sets of anti-people policies that may be targeted at abridging the fundamental human rights of Nigerians. The right group raised the alarm while expressing disappointment at the declining respect for the fundamental human rights of citizens under the administration of Buhari. In a short new year message, HURIWA’s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, said there are “ominous signs that there could be a deliberate activation by the Federal government of President Muhammadu Buhari of some sets of anti-people policies that may be targeted at abridging the constitutionally guaranteed fundamental freedoms of the citizens such as the Rights to civil liberty, Freedoms of movement and ASSOCIATION and most importantly, there could be a renewed resolve by this government to curb the freedom of Expression and Speech. “There are an abundant of supporting facts to show that President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration will in the year 2021 seek to further tighten the noose around the determination of social critics and human rights activists to speak out loud and clear against the rise in the violent abuses of the Constitutionally protected and guaranteed fundamental freedoms of the citizens.” The right group said the coming year of 2021 may be the toughest one for independent minded opinion moulders and activists in the country.

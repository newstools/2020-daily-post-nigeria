Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has appealed to leaders and members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to shelve petty animosities and antagonism and work towards winning elections for the party. Uzodinma made the appeal in his address during the enlarged caucus meeting of the South East zonal chapter of APC held in Owerri, according to statement on Thursday. The Governor noted that APC in the Southeast has all it would take to dominate the zone and stressed the need for unity, brotherly love and genuine reconciliation of aggrieved members. While brainstorming the way forward for the South East zone, especially in the All Progressive Congress, APC, Senator Uzodinma also reiterated the party’s resolve and readiness to win the upcoming 2021 governorship election in Anambra State. Parts of the statement read, “I hosted the end of year meeting of the stakeholders of our great party, the All Progressives Congress Party (APC) in Owerri, with prominent APC leaders from the region in attendance. “The essence of the meeting was to brainstorm and chart the way forward for the zone, especially in the party. “At the meeting, we harped on the need for continuous membership drive/registration and reconciliation of party structures from ward to state and even national levels. “Recall that the APC was recklessly blackmailed in the past with all manner of names and attributions but today, the South Easterners have seen all the dividends of democracy accruing from the party to the zone and hence, realized the need to join the ruling party for more benefits to the zone. “Going forward, the Anambra governorship poll is on ground to demonstrate the resolve of the party to capture the zone. I believe that winning the Anambra Gubernatorial election coming up in 2021 will make the party stronger in the zone. And we can only succeed in doing this through genuine reconciliations and unity among members of the party.”

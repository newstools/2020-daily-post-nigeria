Irate youths of Awo Idemili Community in Orsu Local Government Area of Imo State on Saturday set ablaze a suspected armed robber in the community. It was gathered that the suspected robber met his waterloo after he and his partner-in-crime robbed two ladies of the sum N4 million in front of a popular filling station in the area. DAILY POST reports that the two ladies had withdrawn the money at one of the new generational banks at Orlu town when the robbers accosted them with guns. An eyewitness who preferred anonymity said, “the robbers followed the vehicle and could not attack the ladies because of the busy nature of the Orlu-Ihiala Road. It was when they got to Awo Idemili that they double-crossed them and snatched the bag containing the money at gunpoint. “But while attempting to mount their bike, some of the bundles of money fell off from the bag. One of the suspected robbers tried to pick up the fallen cash. “It was in the attempt to pick the money that some operatives of the vigilante group in the area apprehended them. “They opened fire on the operatives of the vigilante group but could not succeed. “In the process, one of the robbers was caught and immediately set ablaze by the angry youths,” he narrated. According to reports, the victim’s lifeless body was still lying along the busy road and is gradually decomposing and may cause health hazards if not evacuated. DAILY POST investigations reveal that the suspect was among the notorious armed robbers from Njaba and Oru East areas that have been terrorising the Njaba, Oru East, Orlu and Orsu parts of the state in recent times. The Police Spokesperson in the state, Orlando Ikeokwu, confirmed the incident. He said the youths had set the suspected robber on fire before policemen arrived at the scene.

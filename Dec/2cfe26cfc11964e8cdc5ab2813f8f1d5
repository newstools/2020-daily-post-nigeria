FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, on Tuesday, visited the Kado Fish market as well as the Yarkasuwa makeshift market in Gwarimpa. It will be recalled that portions of both markets were gutted by fire over the Christmas holidays. Bello, who was accompanied by the Executive Secretary of the FCDA, Engr Umar Gambo Jibrin and other senior members of staff of the FCTA commiserated with the traders on their loss. This was made known in a statement released by his Chief Press Secretary, Anthony Ogunleye in Abuja.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-861013" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_9458-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1707" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_9458-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_9458-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_9458-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_9458-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_9458-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"> The statement read in part, “At the Yarkauwa makeshift market, Malam Bello said discussions would be held with the Federal Housing Authority over the incident.” Speaking earlier, the Chairman of the Kado Fish Market Traders Association Alhaji Yusuf Muhammed said that the fire occurred when there were very few people around as the Christian traders were celebrating Christmas while the Muslims were observing the Jumaat prayers.

Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has said he is not happy at the club because he has not won a trophy yet. United go into today’s Premier League fixture against Leicester City five points behind leaders Liverpool with a game in hand. The Red Devils are already out of the Champions League but have a Carabao Cup semi-final against Manchester City, as well as the FA Cup and Europa League. Fernandes, who has enjoyed an impressive first year at Old Trafford, told BT Sport: “I’ve enjoyed it a lot. I enjoy [being at] one of the biggest clubs in the world. It was a dream come true to come to the Premier League, to come to a club I have always dreamed of playing for. “Of course, it was better for me when I could play and enjoy my games with fans. When I arrived, at the time it was the FA Cup and the Europa League, and we had the chance to get into the top four in the league. “Unfortunately, we went out in two semi-finals but we achieved third place in the league. The only thing I’ve missed this year is the trophies. I don’t have trophies for the club and I’m not happy about that. I hope 2021 can be better in that way.”

Former President of Nigeria, Goodluck Jonathan, has said the unity of Nigeria is questionable. Jonathan stated this while speaking during an exclusive command performance by the Port-Harcourt Male Ensemble International tagged ‘Peace for All Nations’ at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Abuja. He stated that Nigerian youths sometimes engaged in all kinds of confrontation, recalling his conversation with one of his friends. “And I was discussing with somebody, one of my friends and I said look, in Nigeria, they appear not to even have a national youth body. Because in most cases, the regional youth bodies are stronger than the national youth body. “Ordinarily, the national youth body is supposed to be stronger than the regional youth body. If you go to my state, Bayelsa state for example, if I am a national member of the Nigerian Youth Council, the IYC, Ijaw Youth Council, feels that they are your boss. “If you go to the Southwest and to the North, the Arewa Youth Group, they feel they are superior to the national youth body. “If you go to the Southwest, the same thing. If you go to the Southeast, the same thing. That shows clearly that as a nation, we are in trouble. The unity of the country is questionable,” Jonathan said.

RB Salzburg midfielder, Dominik Szoboszlai, has rejected a move to Arsenal and will sign RB Leipzig instead, according to Sky Germany. The 20-year-old has emerged as one of the most in-demand playmakers in Europe following his impressive performances for the Austrian champions. The Gunners were among the clubs interested in Szoboszlai, with Mikel Arteta still keen to strengthen his midfield options with more creativity. However, Szoboszlai has now made the decision to join RB Leipzig in the January transfer window. Salzburg’s sporting director, Christoph Freund, has been in Leipzig this week to negotiate the deal and a deal will be officially announced before Christmas. RB Leipzig are now due to pay the €25million release clause within two weeks of it being activated and Salzburg will receive a 20 per cent sell-on fee if Szoboszlai leaves RB Leipzig.

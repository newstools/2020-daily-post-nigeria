Northern Elders Forum, NEF has said President Muhammadu has no empathy and has failed to recognise that Nigerians are scared and dying. The Spokesman of the group, Hakeem Baba Ahmed said this while speaking with Channels Tv over the increasing rate of insecurity in Nigeria. He said the Presidency keeps telling Nigerians to pray but has failed to do anything serious about the killings in the country especially in the North. “I feel sorry for the president, if he does not do anything and we just hear excuses then we are in serious trouble. “The Presidency does not feel empathy. We don’t see a presidency who recognises the fact that we have serious problems but all we hear is we should pray. “We are praying that God shows Buhari the way to fix the country. As northerners we are dying and Southerners are being killed. “Buhari needs to do something serious, we measure him by just one thing and that is ‘What is the outcome of your commitment’ the country has become so dangerous to live in. “How many have to die before Buhari do something serious? Ahmed questioned.

Former Manchester United defender, Wes Brown, has warned Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side about two Real Sociedad players, Adnan Januzaj and David Silva ahead of both sides’s Europa League round of 32 clash in February 2021. Brown gave the warning while reacting to Man United’s UEFA Europa League round of 32 draws with Real Sociedad on Monday afternoon. He said that Januzaj, a former Man United player would like to prove a point against the Premier League giants, while Silva, a former Manchester City star, would like to play well against the Red Devils. “Any former United player always wants to play well against his old team,” Brown said as quoted by Man United’s official website. “Adnan has started off well there, so he and David Silva will want to play well. “They have taken good advantage of Barcelona and Real Madrid’s poor start to the season and I do have to say it’s a tough draw for us. “But Adnan will want to show his maturity now, after going there to [Real] Sociedad and they are top of the league.”

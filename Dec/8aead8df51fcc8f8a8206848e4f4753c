The Rivers State Police Command has confirmed the death of two persons during the distribution of Christmas palliatives at an event centre, along the Rumuodara axis of the East-West Road, Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of the state. Spokesman of the Command, SP Nnamdi Omoni in a statement said the incident happened when a Non-Governmental Organisation was distributing palliatives to their registered members from Ikwerre, Emohua and Obio-Akpor Local Government Areas. SP Omoni said there was a stampede during the distribution leading to the death of two people, while some sustained various degrees of injuries and are currently receiving medical attention. The Command added that “while the situation is under control, the State Commissioner of Police, Cp Joseph Mukan has instituted an immediate probe into the unfortunate incident to ascertain the circumstances and bring persons found culpable to justice.” DAILY POST reports that the incident happened at about 7:30am on Tuesday, as thousands of Pinkcoin members, an online blockchain digital assets designed for giving charity, were said to have gathered to receive some palliatives. There were speculations, however, that the management of the NGO failed to control the crowd of persons, who struggled to gain access to the office.

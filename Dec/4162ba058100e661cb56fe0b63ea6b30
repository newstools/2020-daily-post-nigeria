The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, on Friday, cautioned the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, against justifying the “terrorist tag” on the group. OYC made the call in response to the recent confessions of IPOB members, who attempted to detonate a dynamite at the church attended by Elder Wike, father of Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike in Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Though, IPOB had insisted that its members were not involved in the attack, OYC said such an act would be “the incubation of monsters and end of the road for IPOB.” The group stated this in a statement sent to DAILY POST and signed by its President-General, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Comrade Obinna Achionye, Deputy President General of OYC, and Mazi okwu Nnabuike, Secretary-General of OYC. OYC insisted that “it’s never too late for IPOB to rescind this dangerous path of self destruction and retreat from making reckless statements that will be used as a trap and huge indictment against them and Justifiable reasons for anyone to believe that the terrorist tag on them was genuine. “With past IPOB’s threats and rantings, it will be difficult for them to exonerate themselves from the alleged Bombing of Wike Father’s church, and the fact that IPOB Suspects Confessed over the alleged terrorist attacks on the Church is a bad omen and IPOB is finished.”

Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has insisted that midfielder, Paul Pogba, has a very good attitude and could stay at the club if the club wins trophies. Pogba, who has constantly been linked with a move away from Man United, has only won two major trophies (League Cup and Europa League) since he re-joined the Red Devils in 2016. Speaking ahead of Man United’s Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Everton on Wednesday night at Goodison Park, Solskjaer told ESPN, “It’s always a demand here at Manchester United to win trophies. “And the more we win trophies, the more players will want to play for us – then the higher standard you have got to set yourself. ‘It’s a demand for the players, a challenge for the players that we want them to improve and get better and better. “Paul [Pogba] has been here now for a while and, of course, he wants to win more trophies. “He’s got a very, very good attitude to training and playing football. “He loves football, he is ambitious, he wants to have success – like most of the others that are in the squad. We are not all the same. “I would say that this squad has impressed me with their attitude and spirit lately and the way that they go about their work. “Of course, it is down to us to win trophies, and then we will see who will be part of the team going forward,” he said.

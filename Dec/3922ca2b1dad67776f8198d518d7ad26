The Court of Appeal in Abuja has affirmed the death sentence passed on Maryam Sanda. She was earlier found guilty of murdering her husband, Bilyaminu Bello. A High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) convicted her. On Friday, a three-man panel dismissed Sandra’s appeal for lacking in merit. The judgement upholds her punishment of death by hanging. The deceased was a cousin of former Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Haliru Bello.

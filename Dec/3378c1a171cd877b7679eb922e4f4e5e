A Federal High Court in Lagos has sentenced a 26-years-old man, Muhammed Muhammed, to two years in the correctional centre for peddling 25.5 kg of cannabis sativa (Indian hemp). NAN reports that the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) charged the convict with drug trafficking, to which he pleaded guilty before Justice Ayokunle Faji. Following his plea, the Prosecutor, Mr Jeremiah Aernan, reviewed the facts of the case before the court. Aernan tendered in evidence, a written statement of the defendant, a drug analysis form, a request for scientific aid form and remnants of the narcotics which the court admitted. The Prosecutor also urged the court to convict and sentence the defendant based on his plea and the evidence. He told the court that the convict was arrested on July 7 on Igbirra St. in the Idi-Araba area of Lagos while trading on cannabis, a banned narcotic. According to him, the offence contravenes the provisions of Sections 11(c) of the NDLEA Act, Cap N30, Laws of the Federation, 2004. Delivering judgement, Faji said the sentence would begin from the date of the convictâ€™s arrest.

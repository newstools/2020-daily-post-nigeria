Amara, wife of former Super Eagles captain, Nwankwo Kanu, has reacted to accusation by Osaze Odemwingie. Earlier, Osaze took to Instagram page to warn Amara to stay away from him, accusing her of chasing him. The former Super Eagles star who described Kanu’s wife as ‘Delilah’, told the wife of the Arsenal legend that “it is not our culture to message another man without your husband.” Reacting, Amara took to her Instagram page begging Odemwingie to delete the post, saying her husband was aware of her private chat to him. She wrote: “Oh no, kindly take down this post. Kanu is fully aware of this, we want to talk to you as a family.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-857504 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_5791-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="740" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_5791-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_5791-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_5791-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_5791-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_5791-80x80.jpg 80w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_5791.jpg 1656w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

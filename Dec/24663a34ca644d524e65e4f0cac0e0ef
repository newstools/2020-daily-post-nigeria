Former Holland manager, Louis van Gaal, has claimed Manchester United might wait until the end of the season before they sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as manager. Solskjaer, who replaced Jose Mourinho as Red Devils boss in December 2018, has endured a turbulent spell during his time at Old Trafford. United is currently seventh in the Premier League but could climb as high as a second-place if they win their games in hand. They are already out of the Champions League, however, having lost their final two group games to slip into the Europa League. Discussing Solskjaer’s future at the club, Van Gaal who himself was sacked by United, said: “Solskjaer is an ex-player, so they will not sack him as quickly as someone else. “United won’t sack a manager during the season, especially Solskjaer. I see all the stories about Solskjaer and his future in the media. “But they waited to sack me until the end of the season and that could happen to him.”

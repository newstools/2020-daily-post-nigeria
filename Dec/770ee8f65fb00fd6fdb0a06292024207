The Presidency has asked Nigerians to be thankful for the little mercies shown to them by the President Muhammadu government and emphasize on them instead of finding faults. Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, stated this on Channels Television’s Sunday politics. He said Nigerians should be thankful that bombings by Boko Haram insurgents no longer happen on a daily basis in the country. Adesina stated this while responding to the complaints by Nigerians over the rising insecurity in the country. He recalled that there was a time in Nigeria when bombs would go off for about 6 times in a single day, insisting that since Buhari became President, the killings had reduced. Asked if security had improved under the current government, the presidential aide said, “Yes, there are times, a week, two weeks even a month that you don’t have all these things happening. “There was a time in the immediate past when they happened daily several times. You talked of one bombing within three or four days. “There was a time in this country when bombs went off like firecrackers every day. “There could be five, six bombings in one day. Now, you can have two, three months with no single case of bombing. “Let’s be thankful for small mercies. Any mercies we receive, let’s be thankful for it and let’s not dwell on negatives alone. “Life is taking the rough and smooth together. So, sometimes we see when things go on for days, for weeks with no negative developments, let us emphasise those ones… We have challenges, but these are not the constants in the country.” About 344 students from the Government Science Secondary School in Kankara, Katsina State were abducted from the boarding school over a week ago. They were, however, returned on Friday, having spent exactly one week in the kidnappers’ den.

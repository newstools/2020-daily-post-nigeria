The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said former Nigeria president, Goodluck Jonathan, would be free to contest for the presidency in 2023 on its platform. However, the party has insisted that the presidential ticket has not been zoned to any region of the country yet. The National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, stated this during a media parley on Thursday in Abuja. Secondus revealed a committee has been set up to review the party’s performance in the 2019 general elections. On whether former Jonathan would be brought to run on the platform of the party, Secondus said once the committee submits its report, those interested will be at liberty to throw their hats in the ring. He said: “I stand by my position that the Governor Bala-led committee is still working, they are coming out with a report on why we lost and by the time they finish, we will take decisions and the decision is not for the National Working Committee but for the entirety of our party. “I believe that whoever is interested in the 2023 election, including the former President, the chances are there, because the PDP is a party of all. “Everybody will have that opportunity but in clear terms, we have not taken any decision to give anybody the ticket for now.”

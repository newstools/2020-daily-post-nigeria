Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has insisted that Arsenal are struggling under their head coach, Mikel Arteta, because there is a ‘lack of harmony’ at the North London club. Ferdinand said this ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Southampton on Wednesday night. Arsenal are currently in the 15th position on the Premier League table with 13 points after 12 matches. Arteta’s side lost their last three Premier League fixtures against Wolves, Tottenham Hotspur and Burnley respectively. Asked why Arsenal are struggling under Arteta, Ferdinand told the FIVE YouTube channel: “I just think they are lacking in harmony. “We’ve seen the new signing, [William], Saliba, talking to [Matteo] Guendouzi on social media. And obviously, Mesut Ozil is on the sidelines as well. “Mikel Arteta came in and bang, set my stool out this is what is going on, and these players are not playing. “Now, if you do that and you are winning like he was earlier on in the season, then you do not hear anything. You do not hear any murmurs or mutterings behind the scenes from any players because you cannot say anything. “Once that changes, and you start losing games and pressure starts mounting. Then the people that are not playing start being a part of the group that maybe affects the harmony. “That is why you either have to get rid of them and get them out of the building or you’ve got to keep that door ajar and let them know there is an opportunity, so they do not become bitter, and they do not become people that want to talk in the media. “I think it is down to Arteta to handle that. He has to handle the dilemmas of the changing rooms.”

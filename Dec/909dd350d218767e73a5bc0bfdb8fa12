Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, Nigeria’s First Lady, has reportedly abandoned the Aso Rock Presidential Villa for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, over security concerns. The First Lady has not returned to the country since September after the wedding of her daughter, Hanan. Mrs. Buhari has spent three months in Dubai and not in a hurry to return, stating that the Presidential Villa was not secure for her family, according to SaharaReporters. Mrs. Buhari’s concern is said to have been triggered by a shooting incident which occurred in June. Recall that a crisis ensued at the Presidential Villa in June after her security details removed Buhari’s Personal Assistant, Sabiu ‘Tunde’ Yusuf over COVID-19 scares. When contacted by DAILY POST to speak on the claims concerning the First Lady’s whereabouts, her Spokesman, Aliyu Abdullahi refused to either confirm or debunk the report. Asked to comment on the viral report, Abdullahi said, “Is that so? Please can I get back to you? Just give me some minutes to get back to you?” However, he has refused to take his calls since then.

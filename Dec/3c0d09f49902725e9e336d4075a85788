The latest of these was achieved through air strikes executed on 10 December 2020 at Njimia on the fringes of the Sambisa Forest in Borno State. The attack, which resulted in the neutralization of several BHTs as well as damage to their structures, was conducted after a series of aerial surveillance missions showed an uptick of activities in the settlement. “Consequently, the ATF dispatched an appropriate force package of Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships to engage the location.

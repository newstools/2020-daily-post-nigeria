Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, will sack manager, Frank Lampard if he doesn’t deliver a Premier League top-four finish this season. This claim was made by former Chelsea star, Craig Burley. Lampard’s men are currently in the 6th position on the Premier League table with 26 points from 16 matches after losing 3-1 against Arsenal on Boxing Day. “[Lampard’s] got players out of form, he’s got players that aren’t fully fit, and that is a problem,” Burley told ESPN. “They’ve gone from looking one of the paciest, quickest sides in the Premier League, to one of the most pedestrian. “That is a huge issue for him because you may have noticed with this owner Roman Abramovich, he does not suffer inconsistency, bad results, no matter who it is. “So let me be clear, Lampard is back on the chopping board currently as we speak.” Burley added: “It’s turn-up time for Lampard and these players. This cut and thrust period can make and break you. “I’m not suggesting Abramovich is going to sack him [Lampard] in the next couple of weeks, but there is one thing they need to remember – top four. If they don’t get in the top four, he’s probably done. “It’s a big season for him. It looked as if it was going swimmingly and now it looks like they’re sinking a little bit. They seem to have a weight around their feet. He’s going to have to find the reason to put it right.” Meanwhile, Chelsea played a 1-1 draw with Aston Villa on Monday evening at Stamford Bridge, thanks to Olivier Giroud’s strike.

Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has said that the Gunners will ‘try’ to win the Carabao Cup this season. Arteta said this on Monday ahead of Arsenal’s Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City on Tuesday night. “It’s not enough, isolating just one competition. We have to play every competition to try to win it [Carabao Cup],” Arteta was quoted by Arsenal’s official website as saying at his pre-match press conference. “Last season, we managed to win two of those, and we have a really nice opportunity because we have done really well in the competition this year and tomorrow’s game [against Man City] is another step forward to be closer to winning another trophy, and this is what we are going to try to do. “But this doesn’t mean that it’s going to reflect on the rest, or it is going to look better because at the moment – whatever happens in any other competition – in the Premier League we are nowhere near where we should be.” The kick-off time for Arsenal vs Man City is 9 pm, Nigerian time.

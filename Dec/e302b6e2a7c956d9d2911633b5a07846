A suspected armed robber, Abiodun Michael (aka X1) has been arrested on Tuesday by men of the Ogun state police command while carrying out a robbery operation with his gang members along Polytechnic Road, Ilaro. The Ilaro divisional police headquarters had received a distress call that some robbers had blocked the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro road, dispossessing members of the public of their belongings. This, it was learnt, prompted the DPO of Ilaro division, CSP Olayemi Jacob, to quickly mobilize his patrol team to the scene. Sighting the policemen, the robbers fled, but were hotly chased by the officers, who succeeded in arresting one of them. Two cut-to-size locally made double-barrelled pistols, eight live cartridges and assorted criminal charms were recovered from the apprehended suspect. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, while confirming the incident on Saturday, said the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has ordered the transfer of the suspect to state SCIID for investigation. He also directed that the remaining members of the gang be hunted for and brought to justice.

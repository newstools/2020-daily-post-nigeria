Bukola Saraki, Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) National Reconciliation Committee has said that the party will reach out to the youths, former and aggrieved members, as well as leaders of rival parties to ensure a successful outing in 2023. The former Senate President gave the hint on Wednesday at the inauguration of the team in Abuja. He commended the party for setting up the body, noting that since political parties are vehicles for mobilizing the citizenry, it is important for the passengers in the vehicle to be in harmony. “We will go all out to reach our members who have one grievance or the other and seek to reconcile all of us. We will reach out to numerous key politicians who have left our fold and have indicated an interest in returning to the PDP. “We will reach out to all the youths looking for a party on whose platform they can contribute to the development of our country. We will reach out to those who create jobs in our country and want to support a party with clear and realistic economic policies. “We will hold discussions with many other political leaders in other parties who have expressed the desire to join PDP but have held back until we put our house in order. We will also seek to provide good accommodation for youths and make them a virile driving force behind the PDP.” The ex-Governor of Kwara State added that the committee will make recommendations on how to give a sense of belonging to young Nigerians and get them to contribute ideas on how to achieve consistent growth within the PDP.

The Kaduna State Government has limited the meeting time of churches and mosques to one hour, in a bid to curb the second wave of COVID-19. This was contained in a statement shared by Governor Nasir El-Rufai on Sunday. According to the statement, civil servants from Grade 14 and below are to work from home from Monday, December 21. It read in part, “Further to COVID-19 containment measures announced last week, KDSG has directed civil servants below Grade Level 14 to work from home from Monday, 21st December 2020. “Places of worship must enforce facemasks, provide sanitisers, and ensure physical distancing. The number of worshippers will be capped. Congregational worship should not exceed one hour. “Transport operators must reduce capacity to not more than two passengers per row and not more than 50 per cent of capacity. “KDSG appeals to all residents to see Covid-19 prevention as a personal responsibility.”

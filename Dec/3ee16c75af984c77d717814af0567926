Monday night football between Manchester City and Everton has been postponed, because of a COVID-19 outbreak among the City squad. It is the second Premier League fixture to be called off this season due to Coronavirus outbreak, after Aston Villa vs Newcastle earlier this month. On Christmas Day, Manchester City announced Gabriel Jesus and Kyle Walker had tested positive for coronavirus, along with two members of club staff. The club has now closed their first-team training ground. A Manchester City statement read: “After the latest round of Covid-19 testing, the club returned a number of positive cases, in addition to the four already reported on Christmas Day. “With the security of the bubble compromised, there posed a risk that the virus could spread further amongst the squad, the staff and potentially beyond. “Based on strong medical advice the Premier League, in consultation with both clubs, have decided to postpone the fixture.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has left Paul Pogba out of his starting XI in their crucial Champions League clash against RB Leipzig, according to the UK Telegraph. The Red Devils will need a point on the final matchday to qualify from Group H for the round of 16. However, Pogba was missing from their final training sessions ahead of the game. The 27-year-old is not expected to be in the starting XI in Germany barring any late change. The news comes just a day after his agent, Mino Raiola, declared that the France midfielder wants to leave. Raiola urged United to sell their Â£89million record signing next summer or risk losing him for nothing when his contract expires in June 2022.

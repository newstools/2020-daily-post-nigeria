One Mrs Florence Ogbonna, who the police said was the owner of the recently discovered baby factory in Mowe/Ofada axis of Obafemi Local Government area of Ogun State has been arrested. It will be recalled that Ogbonna, whose case is still before an Ogun State Magistrate court, was said to have returned to the area to continue her baby factory ‘business’ after she was granted bail. Recently, two homes were discovered in the area with teenage pregnant women, nursing mothers and kids rescued by the police from Ogun command. Some of the women said they were lured to the homes by Ogbonna from the Eastern part of Nigeria, on the assurances that they would be given a job to make ends meet. Police said a woman had accused Ogbonna of selling her baby and giving her N100,000. The Ogun State police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi earlier disclosed that the suspect, who was presently standing trial for human trafficking, allegedly jumped bail and absconded when the new baby factories were discovered. However, after about two weeks of manhunt, the police succeeded in apprehending the suspect. Speaking with newsmen at Zone 2 Command in Abeokuta, on Monday, the suspect denied all allegations against her, saying she was “only helping young ladies who needed help.” The woman said she was running a motherless babies’ home, which she claimed was registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC).

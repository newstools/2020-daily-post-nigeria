The Federal High Court Lagos on Friday authorised Ayodele Fayose, a former Governor of Ekiti State, who is facing an alleged N2.2 billion fraud trial, to go on a foreign medical trip. Justice C.J. Aneke gave the permission after an application by Fayose’s lawyer, Ola Olanipekun (SAN). The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, which is prosecuting Fayose through its counsel Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), didn’t oppose the application. The judge, however, adjourned the case for further hearing until January 22, 2021. DAILY POST recalls that Fayose is on trial alongside a firm, Spotless Investment Ltd. In the charge, the EFCC alleged, among other things, that Fayose, “took possession of the sum of N1, 219, 000,000 to fund your 2014 gubernatorial campaign in Ekiti State, which he ought to have known formed part of the proceeds of an unlawful act, to wit: criminal breach of trust/stealing.” on June 17, 2014. Fayose was also alleged to have on the same day “received a cash payment of $5,000,000 from Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, the then Minister of State for Defence, which sum exceeded the amount authorised by law and thereby committed an offence contrary to sections 1 and 16(d) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 (as amended) and punishable under Section 16 (2)(b) of the same Act.” Fayose and Spotless Investment pleaded not guilty.

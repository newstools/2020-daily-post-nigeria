The Catholic Archdiocese of Imo State has solicited prayers from Godâ€™s people across Nigeria for the safe release of Auxiliary Bishop, Moses Chikwe. The Archdiocese is praying that the aged Bishop is released without being hurt by his abductors. Most Rev. Anthony Obinna, the Archbishop of Owerri Catholic Ecclesiastical Province, made the request in a statement dated 28th December 2020 and signed by Rev. Monsignor Alphonsus Oha. Recall that Bishop Chikwe was abducted in the evening of Sunday, 27th December 2020 at Site and Services, New Owerri, Imo State. Meanwhile, the Catholic community in the state is in deep fear as the abductors of the Bishop are yet to communicate or make any demands.

Abia State Police Command, on Tuesday, rescued two children allegedly stolen by child-traffickers. The children were lured with biscuits and abducted by the traffickers. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna confirmed to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), in Aba, that they were still investigating and making contacts to find one of the child’s parents. Ogbonna, therefore, asked parents whose male child was abducted to contact the command for verification and release. He said: “One of the two, who was stolen from Abayi-Umuocham in Aba has been handed over to his parents.” He revealed that the police were having difficulty identifying the second child’s parents. The police spokesperson noted that the child, who could not say his name or address of his parents because he was tender, still remained with the police while the search for his parents continued. He disclosed that the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the Police Command under SP Johnbull Obioguru rescued the children from those who bought them in Lagos State and Port Harcourt, Rivers State, respectively. Ogbonna also appealed to parents to be cautious about leaving their children to others or letting them go out of their sight.

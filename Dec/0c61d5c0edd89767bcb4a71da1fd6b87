The Nigerian Army on Monday night confirmed that 333 students are still missing after suspected bandits attacked Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina on Friday night and successfully abducted the schoolboys. Major General John Enenche, the Coordinator of Defence Media Operations, made this known on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Monday. The figure tallied with the one earlier announced by the Katsina State Government on Sunday. “The principal reported that he had 839 in the boarding house; and as at the time they were abducted, shortly after that, some came back and it was about five hundred plus that did not return,” he explained. According to him, “As at 2 pm (Sunday), the students that could not be accounted for reduced to 333. Out of that 333, before I came into the studio, one escaped out of wherever they kept them.” The army spokesman further gave further insight on how the over 300 schoolboys were moved away from their school by the gunmen. The Kidnappers ferried the students into the bush using motorcycles and from there some of the students escaped, according to Enenche “That is their usual characteristics – those abductors. “It is the same system; the same approach they used. There was no evidence, no information about them using other modes of transport,” he added.

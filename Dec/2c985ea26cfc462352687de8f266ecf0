Nigeria has approved the engagement of a Civil Society Organisation (CSO) that will monitor the implementation of $312million Abacha loot recovered in May. The money was repatriated from the United States and the Bailiwick of Jersey. In April, America released details of the funds laundered through the U.S. banking system. It was held in bank accounts in Jersey in the name of Doraville Properties Corporation, a BVI company, and in the name of a son of late military ruler, General Sani Abacha. In a statement on Thursday, Umar Gwandu, spokesman to Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, said Cleen Foundation will monitor transparency in the management of recovered funds. The U.S. had disclosed that Nigeria promised to engage a CSO who has “expertise in substantial infrastructure projects, civil engineering, anti-corruption compliance, anti-human trafficking compliance, and procurement to provide additional monitoring and oversight.” Gwandu said Cleen Foundation was approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday after a presentation by Malami. The organisation will keep track of execution of the 2nd Niger Bridge, Abuja to Kano Expressway, and Lagos to Ibadan Expressway. A total of 17 local and international CSOs applied to monitor the spending.

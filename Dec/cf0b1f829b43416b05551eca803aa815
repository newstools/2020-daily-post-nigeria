The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Tuesday claimed the All Progressives Congress, APC, had finally dissolved out of Nigeria’s political firmament. The PDP alleged that the ruling party has gone into extinction following its failure, corruption as well as the plagues of economic recession, violence and killings in Nigeria. The party made the assertions in response to APC’s dissolution of its zonal and state executives. APC National Executive Council, NEC, had dissolved most of its structures at a meeting on Tuesday. However, a statement by PDP’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan urged Nigerians to celebrate the alleged extinction of APC. Ologbondiyan said: “PDP congratulates Nigerians across the country, as their tormentor for five years, the All Progressives Congress (APC), has finally dissolved out of our political firmament. “APC, being overburdened by the weight of failure, humongous corruption as well as the plagues of economic recession, violence, killings and hardship it has brought to our people, forcefully exited itself from the nation’s political firmament by dissolving all it’s national, zonal and state structures. “With this exit, December 8, 2020 has gone into the history of our nation as liberation day, especially given the spontaneous jubilation by Nigerians over this step towards political oblivion by a political party that has brought so much pain on them. “Nevertheless, the PDP invites all leaders of the fizzled APC to get ready to answer Nigerians for their misdeeds, and not to think they can get away with their atrocities by forming or joining another political party.”

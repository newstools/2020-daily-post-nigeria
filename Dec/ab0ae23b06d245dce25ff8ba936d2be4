Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, is considering a move for Barcelona midfielder Riqui Puig when the January transfer window opens. Puig has been made available for loan following a falling out with Barca manager Ronald Koeman, according to The Athletic. Arteta is in the market for a creative midfielder, with the likes of Lyon’s Houssem Aouar and Borussia Dortmund’s Julian Brandt on the shortlist. However, a more opportunistic option has emerged in the shape of Puig. The 21-year-old was watched on several occasions by Arsenal’s scouts before they were made redundant and will be allowed to leave Camp Nou when the window reopens. Puig has struggled to impress Koeman and has only made an appearance in La Liga this season – a three-minute cameo against Getafe. He has not been handed a start at all in any competition, with Koeman rather scathing in his assessment of the young midfielder recently.

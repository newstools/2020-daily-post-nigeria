A Federal High Court in Lagos on Tuesday adjourned until Jan. 18, the trial of a former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Jumoke Akinjide, for N650m fraud. Akinjide is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alongside Sen. Ayo Adeseun, a Peoples Democratic Party chieftain, Olarenwaju Otiti and former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke. The EFCC had accused the defendants of conspiring to take possession of N650 million crime proceeds. The commission added that the defendants took possession of the sum without going through a financial institution. However, the case could not be heard on Tuesday as the prosecutor, Mr Usman Buhari, informed the court of a motion filed by defendants, challenging the jurisdiction of the court to entertain the suit. Buhari said that the prosecution would need time to respond to the motion. The judge consequently adjourned the case until Jan. 18, for hearing, NAN reports.

President Buhari has condemned the bandits’ attack at the Government Science Secondary School in Kankara, Katsina State in the early hours of Saturday. The President in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, ordered the army and the police to go after the attackers to ensure that no student is harmed. He also urged the school authorities to carry out an audit of the population of students, following shootings that sent hundreds of children fleeing and scrambling over perimeter walls. The President, however, advised that parents who rushed to the school to take their children should notify the school and police authorities to have a full account of the school population. “I strongly condemn the cowardly bandits to attack innocent children at the Science School, Kankara. “Our prayers are with the families of the students, the school authorities and the injured,” “I have also directed the reinforcement of security of all schools in line with the safe schools’ policy of the administration,” the statement said.

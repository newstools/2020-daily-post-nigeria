Eight persons died, six others sustained injuries, while six others escaped unhurt when a Volkswagen Sharon commercial vehicle rammed into a bus on Wudil-Bauchi highway in Kano State on Thursday. The accident occurred at Dakare village in Garko Local Government Area of Kano. Zubairu Mato, the Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps in Kano, confirmed the development in an interview with NAN in Kano. “We received a call at about 9:30 am on December 3, and we quickly dispatched our personnel and vehicle to the scene of the incident to rescue the victims at about 9:50 am,” Mato said. Mato noted that the accident happened as a result of over-speeding and dangerous driving. “The victims who lost their lives were male adults, while 6 were injured and 6 other escaped unhurt.” The commander explained that the victims were taken to Garko General Hospital in Kano, where the doctor on duty confirmed 8 dead, while 6 others are currently receiving treatment. Mato, however, appealed to motorists to obey traffic regulations and drive carefully to minimise road accidents.

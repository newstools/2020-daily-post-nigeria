Abdulkadir Abdulsalam, National Chairman of the Labour Party (LP), is dead. LP Deputy National Secretary, Kennedy Chigozie, confirmed his exit Tuesday evening. Chigozie said Abdulsalam passed away Tuesday morning. DAILY POST gathered that the politician died in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital. Former National Chairman, Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC), Peter Ameh, said he has lost a friend of several decades. “This is a great loss not only to opposition political parties but to Nigerian democracy as a whole. His progressive ideas will be surely missed”, he added. In its reaction, the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), said it received the news with shock and disbelief. Its co-spokesperson, Mark Adebayo, in a statement, described Abdulsalam as a major pillar who formed the CUPP with like minds and remained committed to its ideals until he breathed his last. CUPP noted that the deceased was an accommodating, experienced, generous and patriotic leader. “Alhaji Salam was a man with a good spirit, caring, loving and always positive. His doors were always open to all irrespective of different political persuasions. We have lost a giant in the political space of Nigeria”, Adebayo added.

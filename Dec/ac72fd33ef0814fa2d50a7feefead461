Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has confirmed that midfielder, Thomas Partey, will miss the Gunners’ Europa League tie against Dundalk on Thursday evening due to a fresh injury. According to Arteta, Partey got injured again in the same area ahead of the Dundalk clash. Recall that Partey returned from a thigh injury to start Arsenal’s North London derby 2-0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur last weekend. The Ghana international walked over to the touchline during the build-up to Harry Kane’s goal that put Tottenham 2-0 up and was replaced by Dani Ceballos immediately. “He [Thomas Partey] got injured in the same area, not exactly the same spot but the same area as before,” Arteta was quoted by Arsenal’s official website as saying. “He will miss the next few matches.” The kick-off time for the match is 6:55 pm.

Peter of the defunct group ‘Psquare’ has given an update on the detention of Nigerian artistes Omah Lay and Tems in Uganda. Both artistes were detained in prison and charged to court for flouting COVID-19 rules in Uganda. Their detention has since generated hashtags ‘FreeTems’, ‘FreeOmahlay’ on Twitter. Speaking on the development, Peter urged Nigerians to be patient, adding that NIDCOM Chairman, Abike Dabiri has assured him that the government is doing everything to rescue them. He, however, warned the authorities in Uganda to release Omah Lay and Tems safely to Nigeria to avoid trouble. His tweet read: “Uganda we no want wahala o! We need our people back home and 100% safe! #FreeOmahLay #FreeTems Thanks you! “Why are they even on handcuffs in the first place? @NigeriaMFA what’s going on? “Just got off the phone with @abikedabiri And she said they doing everything possible to get it all sorted! Please let’s all be calm.”

Lionel Messi equalled Pele’s all-time record of 643 goals for one club, as Barcelona were held to a 2-2 draw by Valencia on Saturday. The visitors took the lead through Mouctar Diakhaby in the 29th minute, before Messi levelled from the rebound of his saved penalty. Pele scored 643 goals with Brazilian side Santos, before a brief stint with the New York Cosmos. Barca then went in front through Ronald Araujo seven minutes after the break. But Ronald Koeman’s men were pegged back on 69 minutes as Maxi Gomez levelled for Valencia. The result leaves the Catalans eight points behind leaders Atletico Madrid, who have played a game less.

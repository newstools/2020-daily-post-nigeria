Brazil football legend, Pele, has congratulated Barcelona’s Lionel Messi for matching his goalscoring record at a single club. Messi netted his 643rd for the Catalans as they drew 2-2 with Valencia on Saturday. That figure matches Pele’s record with Santos in official competition, although the Brazilian scored many more in friendlies and tours. Messi is also Barca’s all-time highest scorer. With the 33-year-old set to break his record this season, Pele has now spoken of his admiration for Messi. “When your heart overflows with love, it is difficult to change your path,” the 80-year-old wrote on Instagram. “Like you, I know what it’s like to love wearing the same shirt every day. Like you, I know that there is nothing better than the place we feel at home. “Congratulations on your historic record, Lionel. But above all, congratulations on your beautiful career at Barcelona. “Stories like ours, of loving the same club for so long, unfortunately will be increasingly rare in football. I admire you very much, @leomessi.”

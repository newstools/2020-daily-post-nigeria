Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu has commended the School of Nursing, Abia State University Teaching Hospital (ABSUTH), Aba, for excelling at the November 2020 General Nursing Council Exams. Ikpeazu in a series of tweets, said the achievement was as a result of hard work by candidates, their teachers, school management, and the deliberate policies put in place by his government to take our education/training in the State to greater heights. Assuring that his administration will continue to invest in education, the governor revealed that the Abia State University (ABSU) is now rated among the top 10 State Universities in the entire federation. “For the first time in 10 years, the School of Nursing, Abia State University Teaching Hospital (ABSUTH), Aba, came tops in the whole country at the November 2020 General Nursing Council Exams. “ For example, we have built 4 new model schools & 477 new classroom blocks; we were the first State to feed her pupils from Pry 1-6 even before @NigeriaGov took over the feeding of pupils from Pry 1-3 nationwide. Despite that, we continued the feeding of our pupils in Pry 4 – 6 which was part of the reasons our school enrolment rate rose from 115,396 in 2015 to an unprecedented 658,472 in 2018. “We have also been training and retraining teachers in our State with Australian and Indian consultants to keep them abreast of global best practices and techniques of teaching. It is therefore not surprising that Abia maintained first position back to back in @waecnigeria from 2015-2019 while we await the ranking for 2020 ”Similarly, the Abia State University (ABSU) is now rated among the top 10 State Universities in the entire federation from its former 34 those who have followed our efforts in raising the quality of education in Abia, they will not be surprised that our candidates at the latest General Nursing Council Examinations had 100% rating and came tops in the entire federation at the Council’s latest exams. “My assurance to Abians is that my administration shall continue to invest in education not only as one of our Pillars of Development but also as a way of ensuring a bright future for the next generations,” he tweeted.

Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council has vowed that the Igbos “will have a rethink” if major political parties fail to cede their 2023 presidential ticket to the South-East. They told the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) not to deny the region, their desire to succeed President Muhamamdu Buhari in 2023. Speaking to reporters in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, the Secretary-General, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, warned those plotting against the zone. “It is our turn. Anybody destabilizing any party because of our interest is making a grave mistake”, Nnabuike warned. On Governor David Umahi’s defection to the APC, he wondered why the development generated uproar. The scribe noted that any one has a right to make a decision they consider appropriate. “We want peace in the South-East region. The opinion of the Governor of Ebonyi State should be respected. He has chosen to go to APC, the stakeholders should allow peace to reign.” Nnabuike disclosed that Igbo youths have agreed not to be used for political thuggery.

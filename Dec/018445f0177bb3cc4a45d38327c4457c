President Muhammadu Buhari has admitted that the efforts of his security chiefs “are not good enough”. According to NAN, Buhari made these remarks while speaking in Daura, Katsina, shortly before addressing school boys of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, on Friday. Most Nigerians are clamouring for the sack of the service chiefs, as the insecurity around the country worsens. But Buhari said, “On the issue of insecurity, I’m extremely worried about it, and I hope next year it will be different. Those among the law enforcement agencies that would remain in charge would be extremely busy. ”We have a lot of work ahead of us and some of these things we may not say because I don’t want to compromise the security and efforts being put by the law enforcement agencies. “But we are accurately aware of our responsibilities. Our responsibility is to secure the country – so we have a lot of work to do. “Armed forces know their job. I meet them; we have security meetings from time to time, they must be very clear of my instructions, and their effort is not good enough for me.”

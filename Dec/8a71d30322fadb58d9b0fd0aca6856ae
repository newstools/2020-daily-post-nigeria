Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said Thomas Partey will undergo another scan this week, as he faces a race against time to be fit for the North London derby on Sunday. Partey has been unavailable for the Gunners’ last two games due to a thigh injury he sustained during the 3-0 home defeat to Aston Villa last month. The Ghana international is yet to be given the green light to return to full training by the medical staff, but Arteta has revealed the 27-year-old is desperate to return to action. “He has been training separately in the last week or so,” said Arteta. “We have to scan him again to see how he is feeling. He is a player that is so willing, that is pushing us every day because he wants to do it. “At the same time, we have to protect and make sure that when he gets back in the team he is ready to do that and whatever extent of minutes we can use him. “So this week is going to be crucial, the moment he starts to train in parts with the team. See how he is feeling and how he is evolving day to day.” Arteta also revealed that David Luiz could feature against Spurs, despite the head injury he sustained during last weekend’s defeat by Wolves. Luiz will however not be involved in Thursday night’s Europa League tie with Rapid Vienna. “I think he will be fit to play if the scar is healing properly. “If he is comfortable heading the ball, then there shouldn’t be any problems,” Arteta added.

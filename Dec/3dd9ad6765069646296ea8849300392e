Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has said he will reject another chance to lead the party. He made this claim in a statement released on Monday. Oshiomhole insisted he holds no grudge against anyone who played a role in his removal and had ordered his lawyers to withdraw the suit challenging his suspension. “I instructed my lawyers to withdraw the suits challenging my purported suspension from office by the proxies of those bent on removing me as chairman. “It is, therefore, the height of mischief to insinuate, as it is being done in some quarters, that I would publicly accept the decision and later surreptitiously seek to contest it in court. “That chapter of my political life is closed. Even if another NEC decision or a court order reverses the dissolution, with utmost humility, I will decline to return as APC chairman,” the statement read in part. Oshiomhole was suspended by an Abuja court on March 5, four months after he was suspended by his state chapter of the party. On June 25, the Oshiomhole-led national working committee was dissolved following a leadership tussle and a caretaker committee chaired by the Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, was set up.

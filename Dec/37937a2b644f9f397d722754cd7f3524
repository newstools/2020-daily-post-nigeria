The Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami (SAN), has said the National Assembly lacks the power to invite President Muhammadu Buhari, to speak on security matters. Malami made this known in a statement on Wednesday titled, ‘Buhari’s Summon: NASS Operates Outside Constitutional Bounds’. The House of Representatives led by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila, had last week summoned Buhari over the killing of over 43 farmers in Borno State and insecurity around the country. Malami responding to the summons said security matters remained the exclusive preserve of the executive arm of government. “As the Commander-in-Chief, the President has exclusivity on security and has confidentiality over security. “These powers and rights he does not share. “So, by summoning the President on national security operational matters, the House of Representative operated outside constitutional bounds,” the statement read in part. Malami also said Buhari can freely address the National Assembly when he wants, but could not be summoned to do so. He added: “The right of the President to engage the National Assembly and appear before it is inherently discretionary to the President and not at the behest of the National Assembly.”

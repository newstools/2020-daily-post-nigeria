The Anambra State Chief Judge, Justice Onochie Anyachebelu, has urged lawyers to help ensure the decongestion of correctional centres around Anambra State by applying for bail for inmates. Anyachebelu made the call while conducting jail delivery at Federal Correctional Centre, Ekwulobia, Aguata Local Government Area. The Chief Judge said, “Court is, and shall ever remain court of justice, as such, if you have a case, ask for bail. “If your argument is logical and in line with the provisions of the law, bail will be granted. “Even if it is refused, find out why, make corrections, get back to the court with clearer argument, you will get justice. “If lawyers can tidy up their cases, present them in the court promptly, Correctional facilities will be decongested,’’ he said. A student of Holy Family Secondary School Igboukwu, Master Chisom Ezeudo, who had been in the correctional facility, was, however, granted bail to the tune ofN200,000 with two sureties in like sum, possibly his father or blood relations. Master Ezeudo was a second defendant in a burglary case involving four other persons. He got bail after his lawyer; Mr Olanike Babalola argued that Chisom was an industrious student who engaged in block moulding during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown period, when schools were closedown. “Unfortunately, the block industry, where he was working was far from his home so he searched for where he can stay that was closer then; he met a friend who lured him into sleeping in a burgled house. “After the burglary, the police came into the building and arrested everybody including Chisom who was not a party to the burgling of the house.’’ Considering this argument, the judge granted Chisom bail.

Singer, Queency Benna has threatened to kill herself after allegedly being raped. Benna, who disclosed her intentions on social media, alleged that a man raped her in a hotel room in Abuja, leaving her feeling depressed and suicidal. The singer further shared the man’s name, photos and screenshots of chats she allegedly had with him to back her claims that he raped her. She claimed the man who is said to be a doctor, invited her for dinner. Explaining that she was initially sceptical, Benna said she later honoured the dinner date and it turned out she made “a big mistake”. The singer who referred to the man as a “bloody hell rapist”, added that she was waiting for her doctor’s report to be out. She also tagged the Nigeria Police Force on her post. Queency confessed she is tempted to jump from the 9th-floor window where she was. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859952 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113032_Chrome-461x1024.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113032_Chrome-461x1024.jpg 461w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113032_Chrome-135x300.jpg 135w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113032_Chrome-691x1536.jpg 691w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113032_Chrome.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859955 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112912_Chrome-461x1024.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112912_Chrome-461x1024.jpg 461w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112912_Chrome-135x300.jpg 135w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112912_Chrome-691x1536.jpg 691w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112912_Chrome.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859956 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112823_Chrome-461x1024.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112823_Chrome-461x1024.jpg 461w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112823_Chrome-135x300.jpg 135w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112823_Chrome-691x1536.jpg 691w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112823_Chrome.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859957 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113043_Chrome-1-461x1024.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113043_Chrome-1-461x1024.jpg 461w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113043_Chrome-1-135x300.jpg 135w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113043_Chrome-1-691x1536.jpg 691w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-113043_Chrome-1.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859953 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112953_Chrome-461x1024.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112953_Chrome-461x1024.jpg 461w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112953_Chrome-135x300.jpg 135w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112953_Chrome-691x1536.jpg 691w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112953_Chrome.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px">

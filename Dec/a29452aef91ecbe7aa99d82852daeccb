Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has said that it is better for Nigerians to put their trust in an insane person than to put their hopes in President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress, APC. According to the cleric, God is far away from politicians in Nigeria. In his 2020 Christmas message he made available to DAILY POST, Giwa specifically said politicians in the country had sold their bodies and souls to the devil. The cleric, however, urged the citizens not to put their trust in them, but only in God. He said, “I laugh when I see politicians making promises they cannot fulfill. Please, learn from president Muhammadu Buhari and the APC. “They promised us light but they ended up giving us darkness. Prior to 2015 presidential election, they vowed to make Naira equal to the dollar in value, but all in vain. “Where is the man who trekked from Lagos to Abuja for Buhari? How is he feeling? “It is better you trust a mad man than President Buhari and the APC. Look at how they have turned Nigeria into. “We thought they meant well when they promised us heaven and earth, but all failed. Someone says their nickname is ‘All Promises Cancelled’. “Even a child in the mother’s womb is not happy with president Buhari and the APC.”

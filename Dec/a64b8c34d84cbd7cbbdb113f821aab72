He urged Christians not to relent in prayers, saying those who brought the virus are working round the clock for another national lockdown. Giwa, in a statement to DAILY POST on Thursday, specifically described those planning for another lockdown as enemies of the people. “Our enemies are not sleeping, they are working round the clock for another national lockdown. After January 20, they want to get the ball rolling from there. “They are happy about the developments in the United States, but God has the final say,” Giwa stated

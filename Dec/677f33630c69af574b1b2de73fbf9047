The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has appointed former Senate President, Bukola Saraki to head its national reconciliation committee. The committee also has onetime Senate President, Anyim Pius Anyim, and ex-governor of Cross River State; Liyel Imoke as members. Other members of the committee include, former governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Dankwambo; ex-Katsina governor, Ibrahim Shema and Hon. Mulikat Akande. A statement by PDP’s National Secretary, Anicho Okoro said the committee would be inaugurated today by 12 noon in Abuja. A terse statement titled: “Inauguration of PDP National Reconciliation Committee,” reads: “May I respectfully convey your membership of the above Committee and invite you to the inauguration of the Committee today 2/12/20 at Legacy House by 12 noon. “The short notice is deeply regretted.” This is coming at a time when the Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi had alleged that he plotted his defection to the All Progressives Congress, APC, with Anyim. Despite going ahead with his defection, Anyim remains with the PDP.

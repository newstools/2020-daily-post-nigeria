Yobe State has recorded 108 cases of COVID-19 with 12 cases from National Youth Service Corps Orientation Camp, Dazigau in Nangere local government area. The State Commissioner of Health and Human Services, Mohammed Lawan Gana represented by Abdullahi Ali Danchuwa, Deputy Co-chair State Rapid Response Team disclosed this in an opening remark during a one-day training of Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) and Ward Development Committees (WDCs). The meeting was organised to train participants on developing strategies to monitor the provision of essential services and COVID-19 response at the facility level. The training was supported by Lafiya-UK aid Programme in Potiskum town on Monday. According to him, “We have recorded 108 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, the problem is that people shy away from giving out samples for testing. “15 health workers have been tested positive in Nguru town which is leading in coronavirus cases with 30, followed by Damaturu 24, Bade 18, Potiskum 7, Fika 4, Karasuwa 4, Gulani 3 while Yunusari and Jakusko have not recorded any COVID-19 cases”. He urged the participants to partner with the Government to reduce the spread of the transmission in the state. “Together we reduce this rate and improve the health of our people. An investigation by DAILY POST revealed that over 3,502 samples were collected in Yobe State, out of which 108 confirmed cases were recorded, with 14 active cases, 86 recovered patients have been discharged, while 8 patients have died. With this development, Yobe State is now 34th on NCDC’s table.

Bishop Godfrey Onah of Nsukka Catholic Diocese says God’s mercy saved Nigeria from destruction in 2020. The cleric cited the coronavirus pandemic and End SARS. In a Christmas homily at Nsukka on Friday, Onah said pulled through despite global economic challenges. “What Nigeria witnessed in this 2020, if not the mercy and love of God, were enough to destroy this country completely. From COVID-19 to #EndSARS protest. Now we are in recession and COVID-19 pandemic phase 2. “Many countries of the world, in spite of their technological advancement, recorded a very high number of deaths from COVID-19 but in Nigeria, God’s mercy is upon us,” NAN quoted him as saying. Onah also urged Nigerians to emulate the humility, honesty and peaceful nature of Jesus Christ.

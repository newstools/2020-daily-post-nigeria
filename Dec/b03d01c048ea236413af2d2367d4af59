Uganda politician, Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu, popularly known as Bobi Wine has disclosed the real reason Nigerian singer, Omah Lay was arrested. Omah Lay and Tems were arrested and locked in Uganda prison for flouting COVID-19 order. Their arrest has since generated reactions from Nigerian celebrities and the government. However, Bobiwine reacting on his Twitter page, said Omah Lay was not arrested because of COVID-19 rules, but owing to an ‘act of shame by a corrupt regime with double standards.’ The serving Member of Parliament for Kyadondo County East constituency in Wakiso District, in Uganda’s Central Region queried Omah Lay’s arrest, stressing that the singer had police protection during the concert. His tweet read: “Truth is #OmahLay’s arrest isn’t about COVID. No! It’s an act of shame by a corrupt regime that operates on double standards. “He obtained a work permit and performed under police protection! Why arrest him? This is as pro-Museveni artists stage street concerts unmolested!”

The Police Command in Taraba State says it has foiled an attempt by some armed men to abduct a Chinese national in the Gidan Dorowa area of Wukari Local Government Area. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP David Misal, disclosed this in a statement he issued on Tuesday in Jalingo. Misal said the armed men had blocked the Wukari-Jalingo highway on Monday, in readiness to kidnap the Chinese. He said one of the suspected kidnappers was killed in a gun battle with the police, while his other accomplices escaped with injuries. “The command successfully killed one of the kidnappers terrorising Wukari Jalingo road and recovered one AK47 with two magazines loaded with 60 rounds of ammunition,” Misal added. The Wukari-Jalingo highway has become a death trap for travellers. Recall that Mr Danlami Shamaki, the Proprietor of Winners Comprehensive Secondary School, Jalingo, was killed on the road in a suspected kidnap attempt.

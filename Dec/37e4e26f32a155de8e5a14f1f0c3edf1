The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) on Monday assured Nigerians that the network of airports across the country are fully prepared for the usual surge in passenger traffic during the Yuletide. Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, General Manager, Corporate Affairs of FAAN, said this in a statement on Monday, in Lagos. According to Yakubu, FAAN has heightened security in all its airports, especially the major international gateways in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Kano. She noted that necessary infrastructure have been put in place to aid compliance with stipulated protocols on COVID-19. “At the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja and Port Harcourt International Airport, the new terminals are fully set to host our passengers in safe, secure and very comfortable ambiences,” Yakubu said. She added that authority has put in place procedures, facilities and systems to ensure safety and security of airport users during the season and beyond. Yakubu appealed to passengers to arrive at the airports early to conclude all check-in procedures in good time, especially with the added protocols occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic and heavy traffic around this time. This, she said, would be necessary to avoid the experience of missing flights.

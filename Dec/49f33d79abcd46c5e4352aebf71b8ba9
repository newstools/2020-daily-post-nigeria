The Lagos State Government has earmarked N32.76 billion in the 2021 Appropriation Bill for security. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu made the disclosure at the 14th Annual Town Hall Meeting on Security. He noted that the year 2020 posed complex challenges to the safety and security architecture of the state. The governor observed significant threats to collective health, safety and security. The Lagos helmsman expressed satisfaction that the government was able to contain all and is now in a better position to prevent future occurrences. “At the 2021 budget presentation on November 10, I stated that the Lagos State Government will commit N9.16billion to social protection in order to critically address other contributors to crime such as substance abuse, youth unemployment and poor education.” Sanwo-Olu said that it was easier to prevent crime than control it. He vowed that nothing will deter his administration from protecting the lives and property of Lagos residents now and in the future. Sanwo-Olu thanked the private sector for their support for the Lagos State Security Trust Fund (LSSTF).

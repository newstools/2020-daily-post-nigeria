Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has insisted that he rejected the chance to coach Manchester United because he was about to take the managerial job at Real Madrid. Ancelotti said he was offered the Man United job by the club’s former manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, prior to the Scottish’s retirement at Old Trafford. Speaking on the development ahead of Everton’s Carabao Cup quarter-final tie against Man United on Wednesday night at Goodison Park, Ancelotti said, “You want to know from me [about coaching at Man Utd]?! “Ancelotti said as quoted by Goal. “I can say that I still keep a fantastic relationship with Sir Alex [Ferguson], and we met when he decided to stop (retire). “But I was close to Real Madrid, and so I appreciate the fact that at that time he talked to me. And that’s it, no other opportunity [to manage Man United].” “Yes, of course, Manchester United is a fantastic club, a fantastic team I battled against them a lot of times when Sir Alex was there, when I was at Chelsea,” he added. “I’ve a lot of respect for this team, for this club, it’s a historical club in the world of football like Milan, like Real Madrid, a lot of respect.”

Two members of the Ogun State House of Assembly have joined youths in the state in a protest against alleged incessant killings by the Nigerian Customs Service. Reports say no fewer than four persons were killed by stray bullets fired by men of the Nigeria Customs Service, Ogun State command. Several other persons were said to have sustained injuries when the customs officers engaged suspected smugglers in Ayetoro and Ilaro area of Yewa. Armed with placards, the youths under the aegis of the National Youth Council of Nigeria headed for the office of the Governor in Okemosan, Abeokuta. They are protesting in the company of Hon Haruna Egungbohun of Yewa North 2 and Hon Adeyanju Adegoke of Isokan Constituencies respectively. The Ogun State Chairman of the NYCN, Abduljabar Ayelaagbe said the youths of Ogun State would no longer keep quiet “if nothing is done about the killings perpetrated by personnel of the Customs Service in the state, especially in border communities.” He said the protest was just a peace walk to demonstrate to the government that “the killing of innocent souls by customs officers is no longer accepted by the youths of Ogun State” saying enough is enough. In their separate remarks, Egungbohun and Adeyanju called for an end to killings by officers of the NCS. They asked the authorities concerned to wade into the matter before it is too late.

The Department of State Services (DSS) has alerted Nigerians about plot by “enemies of state”, to unleash terror on places of worship as well as recreational centres during the Christmas and New Year celebrations. It said the plot would be executed through the use of explosives, suicide bombing and other dangerous weapons. The DSS spokesperson for the Service, Peter Afunanya, in a statement on Tuesday, however, assured that the security forces had taken measures to avert such plans. Afunanya stated, “The Department of State Services wishes to inform the public about plans by some criminal elements to carry out violent attacks on public places including key and vulnerable points during the yuletide seasons. “The planned dastardly acts are to be executed through the use of explosives, suicide bombing and other dangerous weapons. “The objective is to create a general sense of fear among the people and subsequently undermine the government.” The DSS further called on Nigerians to remain extra vigilant and report strange movements to security and law enforcement agencies.

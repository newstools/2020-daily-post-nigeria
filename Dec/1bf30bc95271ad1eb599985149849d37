Abubakar Malami (SAN), the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, has said that no fewer than three-thousand owners of small and medium scale businesses in Kebbi State would receive Federal Government’s post COVID-19 grants in order to enhance their business activities. A statement issued on Monday in Birnin-Kebbi by Dr Umar Gwandu, his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, quoted Malami as saying this at the opening ceremony for the disbursement of N2 billion loan facilities to 549 entrepreneurs in Kebbi, under the Federal Government’s Agri-business Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), NAN reports. Malami disclosed that the FG had noted that many small and medium scale business owners suffered losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown, hence, the need to intervene with grants and soft loans to boost their businesses and enhance their productivity. He said, “Each of the entrepreneurs will receive an amount ranging from one million to five million”, under the scheme.” According to him, 200 wheelchairs would be distributed to People Living with Disability (PWDs) in Birnin-Kebbi during the first week of January, 2021. “As a measure to bring an end to the acute shortage of water, as well as improve healthcare and hygiene, hundreds of boreholes were dug for rural communities through the KDI,’’ the minister added.

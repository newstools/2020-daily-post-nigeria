The Gombe State Government has declared Friday as a work-free day, in preparation for Saturday’s local government election in the state. Governor Inuwa Yahaya, who made the declaration in a statewide broadcast on Thursday in Gombe, said it was to enable the people to return to their various Local Government Areas for the election. He said that there would be restrictions of movement on all non-essential services on Election Day to ensure safety and security of lives and property. “The regulations are for the collective good of everyone, hence the need for the people to comply. “This administration is concerned about grassroots activities, as it is the closest to the people. “The local government, as the closest government to the grassroots, deserves the highest priority. Therefore the decision on who governs and how they should be governed is a matter of great priority,” Yahaya said. The governor expressed the hope that the election would usher incompetent and trustworthy administrators who would manage the affairs of local governments and the state in general. Yahaya, however, warned trouble makers to desist from acts that could endanger lives and property of the people. “Our administration has zero-tolerance for violence or election-related crimes. “My administration will deal with any trouble maker, no matter how highly placed. “I urge all political parties to play the game according to the laid down rules. No political ambition is worth the blood of any Gombe citizen,” Yahaya said.

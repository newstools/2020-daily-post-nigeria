A former Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has backed Arsenal to beat Chelsea on Boxing Day when both teams clash in the Premier League at Emirates Stadium. Berbatov believes Arsenal can secure a shock victory over their London rivals Chelsea on Saturday evening at home, adding that the Gunners manager, Mikel Arteta, is still the right man to take the North London club forward. Arsenal head to the game after losing 4-1 against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday night, while Chelsea defeated West Ham 3-0 in the Premier League on Monday. “Arsenal are in real trouble, but I still think Mikel Arteta can turn things around at the Emirates,” Berbatov told Betfair. “Last week, I said Arteta deserved more time, but since then they suffered two more defeats – admittedly in difficult matches away to Everton in the Premier League and in last night’s Carabao Cup quarter-final against Manchester City. “The Gunners are showing some fight on the pitch, but they are still not playing anywhere near the level demanded of them. “Arteta is a young coach, and you could say he was lucky to get the opportunity to manage Arsenal. “I support those kinds of appointments because I know how difficult it is for young coaches to get their chance to show what they can do.
“Arteta came to Arsenal at a difficult moment for the club, and he needs more time to turn it around. “His old boss Pep Guardiola has said Arteta shouldn’t be fired and I’m not going to argue with Pep.” “Arsenal needs to pick themselves up quickly for their big Boxing Day clash against Chelsea,” Berbatov added. “I can see a surprise result here, with the Gunners winning. Their fortunes have to change at some point and a London derby, against the team they beat in last season’s FA Cup final, could give them the motivation to raise their game.”

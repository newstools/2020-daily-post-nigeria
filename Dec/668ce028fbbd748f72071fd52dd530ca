The meeting between the Federal Government and the leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU on the resolution of strike has been cancelled for the second time. Deputy Director of Press and Public Relations in the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, Mr. Charles Akpan, announced the postponement in a statement on Tuesday. He said the consultation on the latest offer by the Federal Government to striking university teachers was still ongoing. “Good morning, colleagues. Please, note that the meeting with ASUU, earlier scheduled for today, is cancelled. “However, the inauguration of the technical committee on PMS will be held as scheduled,” he said. But ASUU President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi said the union’s leadership did not agree on any meeting with the government. According to him, “the government’s side is also consulting which could also be a factor as to why the meeting was cancelled.” “We never actually agreed on any meeting. What we said was due consultations, and consultations are going on at the two levels. “We believe the government is also consulting and that’s why the meeting has not been held. “So, consultations are going on,” he said.

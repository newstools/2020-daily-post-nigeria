The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) announced that it will start enforcing the National Identification Number (NIN) directive on driver’s license processing nationwide, with effect from Dec. 21. Mr Bisi Kazeem, Assistant Corps Marshal (ACM), Corps Public Education Officer, made this known in a statement on Wednesday, in Abuja. Kazeem said that the enforcement became necessary following the Federal Government’s directives on harmonisation of citizens’ data by relevant agencies. In compliance with the directive, Kazeem advised those going for their driver’s license processing, to adhere to the directives. “As a follow up to that, FRSC management has resolved that effective Dec. 21, 2020, all applicants for the National Driver’s License in Nigeria must present the NIN from the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC). “This is necessary before they can be captured for any class of the licenses produced by the FRSC.” He warned that there will be no waiver for anyone. Kazeem noted that the database will help security agencies in data collation and quick retrievals, to address some of the nation’s security challenges. He further advised the public to carefully follow the procedures for obtaining their NIN from the NIMC, which must be verified to be authentic, before action could be taken on any license application.

It seems like it has been an eternity since we last opened social media or watched the news without seeing COVID-19. The year 2020 has reshaped our lives, economically, but it had a significant impact on the way we do daily tasks. With the first real tangible successful news emerging the past few days about possibly effective vaccines, there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel. As 2021 seems to bring much-needed ease on expenditures and a return to economic growth, it is time to look past that light at the end of the tunnel to what lies ahead. Sub-Saharan Africa’s GDP is expected to grow by 3.6% in 2021 and people that have mastered the challenges we are now facing are expected to take control and steer businesses, schools and governments into the right direction. Like most of us, many schools have adapted to the new norm. While some schools and universities did indeed create a working online learning model, some opted for the very similarly-sounding, but fundamentally different approach of distance learning. Unicaf is collaborating with leading universities since 2012 to offer underserved markets access to quality higher education with affordable fees through a comprehensive online learning model. Unicaf’s partner Universities, the University of East London, the University of Suffolk, Liverpool John Moores University, University of California – Riverside Extension and Unicaf University, offer Bachelor (Unicaf University), Master’s, Doctoral degree (Unicaf University) programmes and professional development courses that you can study through Unicaf’s Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) from the comfort and safety of your home. Having all these choices, flexibility and affordability, gives you the unique opportunity to emerge from this pandemic with the latest in-depth knowledge and take a leading role in the post-COVID-19 business world.

Former England and Arsenal striker, Ian Wright, has given a reason Gunners manager, Mikel Arteta, should play Reiss Nelson ahead of Willian when they face Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Sunday. Wright said Willian has been playing a lot of backwards passing for Arsenal so far this season, adding that Arteta’s men need somebody like Nelson who can at least get back and progress the ball. He said this ahead of Arsenal’s Europa League clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday. “For me, he’s been a little bit negative with the way he’s been playing, a lot of backwards passing. “I would try to throw something else into the mix, Reiss Nelson or even [Bukayo] Saka on the right,” Wright said on Ringer FC’s ‘Wrighty’s House’ podcast. “But Saka’s going to be on the left so I would put Reiss Nelson on the right instead of Willian because we know what Willian’s going to do. “For me, he’s been a little bit negative with the way he’s been playing, a lot of backwards passing. “You need somebody who can at least get back and progress the ball.” He added, “[Granit] Xhaka can pull in on the left, just to put that body in there then [Mohamed] Elneny should hold.”

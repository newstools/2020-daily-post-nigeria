Chelsea have gotten a temporary replacement for injured Callum Hudson-Odoi and Hakim Ziyech. The club’s manager, Frank Lampard confirmed Tino Anjorin has been promoted into his first team set-up as a result of the injuries. Anjorin made his full debut for the west London side in their Champions League 1-1 draw with Krasnodar on Tuesday night. Anjorin, 19, joined the Blues at the age of six and had only made two substitute appearances for the club before yesterday. “In training he had shown us last season a real ability to step straight into the level in terms of his ability on the ball,’ said Lampard in a post-match interview. “He showed it today in the way he receives the ball and how he moves with it very quickly, his physical attributes to protect the ball. “He’s had some fitness issues in terms of completing games at under-23 and youth team levels. “With the injuries we have in the short term he will spend more time with us. He did very well tonight. It was a good debut and he grew into the game as it went along.”

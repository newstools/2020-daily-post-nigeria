President Muhammadu Buhari has welcomed the release of kidnapped students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State. The President in a statement released on Thursday night by his official Spokesperson, Garba Shehu described their safe return as a big relief to their families, the entire country and international community. Buhari expressed the nation’s appreciation for the steps taken by all involved to make their release possible. He specifically cited what he called the “spirit of partnership and the collaborative efforts of the government of Katsina, Zamfara and military leading to the release.’’ Buhari also commended the nation’s intelligence agencies, the military and police force for providing the environment for the safe release of the hostages. “The Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, and the army worked extremely hard. As soon as I got the information, I congratulated them. “The Armed Forces know their job. They have been well trained and properly motivated. “On the issue of detainees held elsewhere in the country by either terrorists or bandits, my administration is aware of its responsibility to protect the life and property of the Nigerians. “I urge Nigerians to be patient and fair with my administration as we tackle the problems of security, economy and corruption. “We have a lot of work to do, especially now that we have re-opened the borders. It is unfortunate that the bandits & terrorists continue to get weapons even under the circumstances of the border closure. “We are going to dare them and will deal with all that,” the President said. He,however, prayed for the full recovery of the students, whom he said had endured significant hardships in the course of their six-day ordeal.

Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has reacted to the utterances credited to All Progressive Congress (APC) that his administration was responsible for criminal activities in the State as it harbours bandits. According to a press statement signed by the Special Adviser to the Governor on media and public enlightenment, Comrade Zailani Bappa, Matawalle accused APC of fuelling the criminal activities during former Governor Abdul Aziz Yari’s unfortunate eight year tenure. The statement noted that President Muhammadu Buhari was satisfied with the peace accord and reconciliation process initiated by Matawalle’s administration as the rate of crime in the State had reduced. “We all are living witnesses to the fact that during Yari’s tenure, Zamfara state was adjudged as a colony of banditry in the whole world and there is no doubt about that. “I don’t want to join issues with Abdul Aziz Yari and his cohorts because they are out only to distract the attention of this administration and make it a failure,” he said. According to the Governor, agricultural activities was moving with the lowest ebb as the farmers abandoned their farming activities due to the fear of terror attacks in the State. The Governor maintained that the same administration of Yari closed down all functional markets in the State, making the people live in abject poverty and penury. “We are not claiming that insecurity has totally been eliminated but it is on record that terror attacks have reduced drastically in the state unlike Yari’s unfortunate eight years tenure when people were running away from the State,” he added.

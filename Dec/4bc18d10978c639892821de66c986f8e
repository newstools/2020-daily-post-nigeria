But Magaji said that the party decided to boycott the election because it has lost confidence in both INEC and security agencies in the state. “The election was marred by intimidation, harassment and large-scale violence that culminated in snatching of ballot boxes, kidnapping of electoral officials and killing of innocent people. “Our representatives attended the stakeholders meeting organised by INEC in Gusau on Monday Dec. 7, to fine-tune measures put in place for the smooth conduct of the supplementary election. “The meeting was supposed to be attended by security agencies in the state because of their pivotal role as critical stakeholders in the election, but neither their heads nor their representatives attended the meeting,” he said. Magaji further stated that the party, reviewed the issues pertaining the election and suggested that the election be shifted to a more convenient date but INEC went ahead with the plans to conduct the election on Dec. 9.

A Federal High Court in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, on Tuesday, sentenced a Swedish-Nigerian woman, Stephany Isaksson, 43, to four years imprisonment over her involvement in child trafficking. The convict who hailed from Mbiayon Uran in Akwa Ibom State was said to have received an 18month old baby from one Uduak, now at large with the intent of trafficking. It was revealed by the court that Issakson was arrested by the Swedish Embassy when she went to obtain the necessary papers for the child and was handed over to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) in 2018 for prosecution. Delivering his judgement with charge number, FHC/UY/108C/2019, Justice Fatun Riman nailed the convict on two count charges for receiving the baby by means of fraud contrary to section 13(2)(b) of trafficking in persons (prohibition) Enforcement and Administration Act 2015 and for obtaining the possession of the baby knowing that the baby will be subject to exploitation contrary to section 21 of the Trafficking in persons (prohibition) Enforcement and Administration Act. Justice Riman, for count one, sentenced the convict to a term of 2 years or pay a fine of 250,000 and also on count two, she was sentenced to a term of 2 years or pay a fine of 250,000, noting that the sentence will run concurrently while the fine is accumulative.

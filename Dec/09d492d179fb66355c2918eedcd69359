Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu has visited his predecessor and the Representative of Abia Central Senatorial district in the red chamber, Senator Theodore Orji. Governor Ikpeazu accompanied by some of his Special Aides was received by Senator Orji and son, now the Speaker of Abia House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Chinedum Orji in his Ibeku residence in Umuahia. Senator Theodore Orji was the Executive Governor of Abia State between 2007 and 2015. Following the Governor’s homage, political watchers in the state who pleaded anonymity hailed the cordial relationship between the Abia leaders. They said the healthy and peaceful cooperation between the ex-governor, Chief Theodore Orji, the Speaker, Chinedum, and Governor Ikpeazu has boosted and enhanced the massive infrastructural development in the state through quality and people’s oriented legislations. Analysts say unlike other governors who engage in war with their predecessors over personal gains, Governor Ikpeazu has remained grateful to Senator Orji and family over their unflinching and steady support to his administration, despite attempts by disgruntled elements in the political circle of Abia State to sow seeds of discord among the trio. A terse statement attached to pictures by the Abia Governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka and obtained by DAILY POST on the visit read, “Governor Okezie Ikpeazu earlier today paid a Christmas visit to the immediate past Governor of Abia State and Senator representing Abia Central at the Senate, His Excellency, Senator T A Orji at his residence at Umuahia. “The Governor also used the opportunity to offer his personal good wishes to the Speaker of the Abia State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon Chinedum Orji whose 50th birthday is today”. Earlier, Ikpeazu had in a warm message issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka and made available on Friday, in Umuahia, described the Speaker as a worthy partner in progress in his quest to provide credible and result-oriented leadership to the people of Abia State. He said, “Since his emergence as the Speaker of the Seventh Abia State House of Assembly, the wheels of cooperation and strategic synergy between the Executive and Legislative arms of our Government have remained consistently well lubricated resulting in a seamless and well-coordinated relationship for the good of our state”. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-860609 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608959937013.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608959937013.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/FB_IMG_1608959937013-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

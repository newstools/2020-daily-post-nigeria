Some children of police officers killed during the EndSARS protests in Oyo State have urged both the federal and state governments to sponsor their education. The children of the slain police officers appealed to good-spirited Nigerians to support them in ensuring that they have a good education. DAILY POST recalls that no fewer than six policemen were killed during the EndSARS protests in the state. Some of the officers killed during the protests in Ibadan were; Peter Abegunde and Rotimi Oladele. Our correspondent recalls that the protests rocked some states including Oyo State where economic activities were grounded for some days in October. But, some children of the policemen who lost their lives during the protests told journalists on Saturday that the death of their fathers has created vacuums in their lives. One of the children of Peter Abegunde, implored government at all levels to support their education. She said that she and her siblings were broken when the news of the death of her father was broken. She, however, added that her fear is how to get education without stress. She said; “When we heard about the gruesome murder of our father, we were heartbroken. “My fear is our education. Many of our mothers are not working and we need to go to school. “I want to appeal to the government to come to our rescue. “We have nobody, except God. “In fact, they don’t need to give us money but they should give us scholarship”.

Chelsea has been handed a significant injury boost ahead of their Champions League clash with Sevilla on Wednesday night. Chelsea survived a potential injury nightmare in their 0-0 draw with Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League over the weekend. There was some concern in the second half against Tottenham when Chelsea defender, Ben Chilwell went down. The England left-back badly rolled his ankle and required medical attention for a few minutes. But the former Leicester City star was able to finish the match, and he has now confirmed the issue was not anything serious ahead of the Sevilla clash. “I was desperate to carry on [against Tottenham], and thankfully I ran it off,” Chilwell told Chelsea’s official website. “It is fine now, so I am just looking forward to recovering and hopefully playing again in midweek [against Sevilla].”

Former Arsenal star, Ian Wright, has named Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic as the two players Chelsea missed following their 1-0 defeat against Everton on Saturday night in the Premier League. Wright said that Chelsea would have got a result against Everton if Ziyech and Pulisic featured for the Blues, adding that the pair are more creative. Ziyech and Pulisic did not feature for Chelsea against Everton due to hamstring problems as the host defeated Frank Lampard’s men at Goodison Park, thanks to Gylfi Sigurdsson’s first-half penalty. “No one [Chelsea player] was comfortable on the ball,” Wright told Match of the Day. “Maybe as a game, if Ziyech and Pulisic were playing – a little bit more creativity – they might have got something. “But it wasn’t happening.” Chelsea’s next Premier League match is against Wolves on Tuesday.

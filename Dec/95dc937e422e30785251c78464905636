Ant Emir in Zamfara State, Alhaji Attahiru Ahmed Muhammad has condemned in strong terms the peace accord and reconciliation process initiated by Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle of Zamfara State. The monarch disclosed this in Kaura Namoda Local Government Area of the state when he paid a condolence visit to the Emir of Kaura Namoda emirate, Major Sanusi Muhammad Asha in his palace. Ahmed who is the Chairman, Zamfara State Council of Chiefs as well as the Emir of Anka noted that the peace accord and reconciliation process initiated by Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle is not producing any beneficial result in the state. “Since the bandits refused to surrender totally, the government should allow everyone to carry their own weapons for self-defence” he suggested. The emir pointed out that one cannot make peace with another who is not ready to embrace peace and reconciliation as initiated by the government. “No single individual in this world is above the power of the government unless the government does not want to act” He, however, urged government at all levels to give the security operatives the chance to deal with the bandits, saying that security operatives can handle the situation but “Orders from above delays the vibrant security operatives from performing their constitutional responsibility”. “One can not make peace with criminals when the bandits have continued to kill everyone in sight because they are bloodthirsty people” The monarch maintained that the bandits have no conscience, saying that their consciences have since been killed. ”This is the main reason they don’t know that killing another human being is inhumanity against human”. He lamented.

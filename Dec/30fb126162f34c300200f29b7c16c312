President Muhammadu Buhari has hailed outgoing President of Niger Republic, Mahamadou Issoufou and the citizens for the peaceful conduct of the December 27 presidential and parliamentary elections. Buhari spoke on Thursday when he received Namadi Sambo, former Vice President and leader of the ECOWAS Electoral Observation Mission (EOM) to Niger. “I have been very impressed by what I have been seeing and hearing. I will call to congratulate him. Issoufou is going home with honour and grace. All’s well that ends well,” he said. The President expressed regrets over reported incidents of violence in some other countries in the sub-region. “Seeing how bloody it has been in some other countries, Issoufou must be congratulated on working out this so well so that he will hand over and go quietly.” Buhari hailed the ECOWAS Mission for the “very impressive” work. Sambo, in his remarks, described the poll as successful, free and fair. “The elections went well. No incident had created an alarm,” he added. The results of the presidential election are being awaited.

The Centre for Human Rights and Anti-Corruption, CHURAC, has said it would challenge the appointment of a sole administrator to manage the affairs of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. In a statement signed by CHURAC National President, Cleric E. Alaowei, he said, “There is nowhere in the NDDC Establishment Act that provides for such illegal Sole Administrator. “At best, the measure is a gateway to continue the sleaze in the Commission. Sen. Godswill Akpabio should not turn NDDC to his personal property. “We will not watch akimbo to allow some corrupt minds to pilfer away our common patrimony. “The forensic audit is another scam. It has only provided a platform for looting of the Commission’s scarce resources. What made Sen. Akpabio to think that the forensic auditors cannot do the work under a substantive board? “President Buhari should not allow his office to be manipulated by these pen robbers. His actions and inactions towards the NDDC crisis are trading with the peace in the Niger Delta. Mr. President should immediately disband that illegal and unlawful Sole Administrator and appoint a substantive board in line with the Commission’s enabling Act. “The President should act fast to reverse his illegal decision on the appointment of Sole Administrator in NDDC or we seek judicial interpretation on the legality of such action.”

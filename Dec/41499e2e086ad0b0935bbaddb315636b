Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has insisted the club has no regrets over allowing Declan Rice leave the club’s academy. There are speculations that the Blues are eager to bring Rice back from West Ham in the January transfer window. It is believed Chelsea would make a move if the Hammers reduce their £80million asking price, which they quoted in the summer. Rice left the Stamford Bridge outfit’s academy at 14 after seven years in the youth ranks, but has go on to become one of the Premier League’s hottest prospects. Ahead of West Ham’s visit to Stamford Bridge on Monday, Lampard said: “He’s a fantastic player for West Ham and England, so fair play because his journey there after leaving Chelsea and going to West Ham is a good story to hear. “There are lots of those stories for different reasons at whatever level and that shows a strength of character. In terms of from our end, I certainly wouldn’t use the word ‘regret.’ Our academy is one of the best in the world. “You look at our first team now, the players we have produced here that are in and around the first-team squad, we’ve got so many. And it is not easy. It is not an exact science to pick and choose whatever players. “The academy works brilliantly here and brings through a lot of players. Declan Rice, let’s give him personal credit for going and having a great start to his career that he’s had at West Ham.”

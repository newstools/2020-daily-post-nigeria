The Nigerian government has expressed optimism that the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, will call off the current industrial action in January, 2021. Chris Ngige, the Minister of Labour and Employment, said the ongoing negotiation between Nigerian government and ASUU would lead to the end of the strike. Speaking in Alor, Idemili South Local Government Area of Anambra State, the minister said negotiation with the academic union has reached 98 percent. Ngige said: “We have met about 98 percent of the request of ASUU. Some 5 to 2 percent is what you can call promissory notes. “So, I am very hopeful that by midnight today, there are some works we are supposed to get on to do. “We will agree now to agree because we were disagreeing before. “We disagree to agree and agree to disagree formerly. But tomorrow, I hope we will agree to agree. Once we do that, schools will re – open in January.” In November, the federal government had agreed to pay all outstanding allowances owed members of ASUU. Ngige had also disclosed that government would release N75billion for the revitalisation of universities and the payment of Earned Academic Allowances. https://dailypost.ng/2020/11/28/asuu-strike-may-be-suspended-as-govt-presents-fresh-juicy-proposal-to-lecturers/

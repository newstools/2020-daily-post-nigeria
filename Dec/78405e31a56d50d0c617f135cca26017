The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has announced new travel rules for passengers coming into Nigeria from South Africa and the United Kingdom. A new variant of coronavirus has been discovered in the countries. PTF National Coordinator, Sani Aliyu, on Thursday, said from Monday December 28, all inbound passengers must use the Nigerian International Travel Portal to register. They are to fill in the health questionnaire and upload a negative COVID-19 – polymerase chain reaction (PCR) – result with a validity of not more than five days. A special register would be opened at the airports to track and ensure they present themselves for the COVID-19 test on day seven. Aliyu warned that there would be sanctions on passengers that presented fake PRC results. The travellers must present two documents to airlines – the negative COVID-19 PCR result, and a ‘permit to travel’ document (the QR code). “The only way you can get the permit to travel is by filling in your health questionnaire electronically, uploading your PCR result and paying for the day seven test. If you do not present a travel permit, the airlines are being directed not to board. “Upload your PCR result that has to be negative and you pay for a day-seven test upon arrival in Nigeria. The second enforcement that we will have has to do with the seven day self-isolation upon arrival in the country”, Aliyu said.

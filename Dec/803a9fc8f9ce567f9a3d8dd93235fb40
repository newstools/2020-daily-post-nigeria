The building that was to host the maiden edition of Kaduna sex party was demolished on Thursday by officials of the Kaduna State Urban Planning Development Agency, KASUPDA. Nuhu Garba, KASUPDA Public Relations Officer, PRO, said that the building, which is located at Sabon Tasha a suburb of Kaduna metropolis, was completely demolished in the afternoon. He said that the demolition exercise was carried out based on the laws guiding the agency. He explained that the law has vested the agency with the power to demolish any building that contravenes the rights of occupancy. The PRO added that if a residential building is turned into something other than the purpose it was meant, the law gave the agency the power to demolish such property especially if itâ€™s against public interest. Garba further explained that they were in Narayi (another suburb) too to carry out a similar assignment, adding that they were there to demolish another building that promotes illicit acts. Report has it that the demolition came barely 24 hours after those behind the sex party were arrested. It was also revealed that many arrests were made between Wednesday and Thursday.

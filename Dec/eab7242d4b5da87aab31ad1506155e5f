Chinda made the call in response to the abduction of students of the Government Science Secondary School in Kankara area of Katsina State by Boko Haram.

According to Chinda: “The president should be impeached over the growing insecurity in the country.” Recall that Boko Haram had abducted about 600 students from the Government Science Secondary School in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State. Following the abduction, the terrorist group had explained that their action was to discourage western education and encourage Islam On Thursday, the insurgent released a video claiming it has custody of the abducted students.

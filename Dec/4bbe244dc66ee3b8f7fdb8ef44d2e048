The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate in the Lagos East Senatorial District bye election, Babatunde Olalere Gbadamosi, BOG, has raised alarm over the results released so far by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, in the Saturday exercise. Gbadamosi said the results are being manipulated. Lamenting on his Twitter page, the PDP candidate said he was rigged out. His tweet read: “The election was manipulated and I was clearly rigged out.” So far, results published by INEC shows that Tokunbo Abiru of the All Progressives Congress, APC, is in early lead. Abiru is closely followed by Babatunde Gbadamosi of the opposition party.

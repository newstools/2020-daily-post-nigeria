The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has described the claims by eight ex-bankers that its investigators pressurised them to pay a bribe of N96 million for their release on bail as untrue. DAILY POST recalls that eight ex-bankers who are standing trial for allegedly defrauding the Central Bank of Nigeria in the mutilated currency scam, had on Thursday, claimed that EFCC investigators demanded N96 million for their release on bail. The defendants, had in separate affidavits deposited at the Federal High Court, Ibadan, Oyo State, alleged that operative of EFCC, Mr. Hammadama Bello, asked them to raise N96 million to set them free. Bello, has, however, denied the allegation. Bello, while reacting, added that he was not in position to influence the release of the defendants. In a sworn counter-affidavit deposed at Federal High Court, Ibadan on December 7, Bello described the claims by the former bankers as a fabrication. He insisted that he did not at any time request for the sum of N500, 000 from the defendants. In a statement obtained by DAILY POST on Thursday, Bello said “I did not at any time request for the sum of N500, 000 or any other sum from either Ayodele Festus Adeyemi or any of his colleagues. “I did not at any time demand for N12 million or any other sum from the defendants or from any other person. “I did not ask any lawyer to collect any money from any of the defendants and I challenge Mr. Festus Adeyemi to name the said Senior Advocate of Nigeria.” “I was not one of the leaders of our team constituted to investigate the case and I could not have promised Mr. Festus Adeyemi or any other person that he would not be prosecuted.”

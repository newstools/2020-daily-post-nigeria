A driver and one of his passengers have died in an auto crash in Ogun State on Tuesday. DAILY POST gathered that five other persons also sustained injuries in the accident, which happened around Foursquare Camp Ground, along Sagamu/Interchange-Abeokuta highway at about 1:14pm. The accident involved a white Mazda bus with registration number, LND 539 XV; a Lexus car GS350 marked, AAA298GK and a truck. The crash was blamed on wrongful overtaking on the part of the driver of the Lexus car, which reportedly resulted in the bus colliding with the unidentified truck. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps confirmed the incident to DAILY POST, saying it involved nine men and seven women. Babatunde Akinbiyi, TRACE Public Relations man told our correspondent that the injured victims had been taken to State Hospital, Ijaye, Abeokuta, adding that the corpses are also at the mortuary of the same hospital. Akinbiyi explained further that, “the Lexus car and the commercial bus, coming from Berger in Lagos, were inbound Abeokuta, while the truck was outbound Abeokuta. “In an attempt by the Lexus car to overtake the commercial bus at the diversion stretch at Foursquare Camp axis of the Abeokuta-Kobape-Siun-Sagamu Expressway, the driver suddenly noticed he was facing an incoming truck, which was almost approaching him. To avoid a head-on-collision, the bus ran into the bush. But, the driver side of the bus collided with the truck and the collision led to the death of the bus driver and the front passenger. “Unfortunately, the two occupants in the Lexus car as well as the truck driver ran away. “Nevertheless, the Lexus car and the commercial bus have been taken to the State Motor Traffic Division, Ibara,” DAILY POST was told.

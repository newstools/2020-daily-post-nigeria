The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Uche Secondus, has rebuked President Muhammadu Buhari for snubbing the National Assembly. Secondus said Buhari has proven that nobody is in charge and the current federal government is broken. Buhari who was scheduled to address a joint session of the National Assembly yesterday had snubbed the lawmakers. The Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, Abubakar Malami had disclosed that the National Assembly had no constitutional powers to invite the President over issues of insecurity. However, Secondus while addressing journalists in Abuja, yesterday said: “President Muhammadu Buhari who was scheduled to address the nation’s parliament today (Thursday) backed out after confirming to them he was coming. “This back and front from the President on vital issue of security that is overwhelming our nation underscores our position as an opposition party that nobody is in-charge and that this is a broken government.”

Joe Nworgu, a former Secretary General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has advised politicians to stay away from the body’s January 2021 elections. Nworgu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Awka that article 11 of Ohaneze’s constitution spelt out methods and persons that qualify for President-General and Secretary-General’s positions. The body cedes positions to five South-East states of Abia, Ebonyi, Enugu, Anambra and Imo as well as Igbo speaking parts of Rivers and Delta. Nworgu insisted that the President-General’s position cannot have a sole candidate. He said the constitution stipulates that at least, three persons from a state can run for President or Secretary. Nworgu added that if other interested parties are subdued, it would mean denying other states the right to choose a candidate. “The clear interest of people outside Igbo race on who leads Ohanaeze is a very dangerous sign to the future of the body as a voice for our people. “If we want other tribes to dictate for us, so be it. But that would mean bringing down the rating of Ohanaeze from the present height Chief John Nwodo has taken the body to,” he said. Mike Okiro, ex-Inspector-General of Police, Prof. George Obiozor, Dr Joe Nworgu, Chief Chris Asoluka, Chief Goddy Uwazuruike and Prof. B. Osuagwu, all desire to lead the organisation. The aspirants are from Imo State.

The Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, on Thursday, assumed office to commence his second tenure for a period of five year,NAN reports. Speaking during a takeover ceremony at the commission headquarters in Abuja, Yakubu said that quick passage of the Electoral Act amendment remained a top priority. “You will recall that I appealed to the Senate Committee on INEC during my screening two weeks ago to conclude work for the passage of the Electoral Act amendment by the first quarter of 2021. “I am glad that in his response, the Senate President has assured the nation only yesterday at the public hearing on the Electoral Act amendment that the National Assembly is committed to that target. “Also, we will endure an immediate resumption of Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) by the first quarter of 2021. “The exercise would continue for at least six months to the 2023 general elections. “We will also use the opportunity as required by law to clean up the register of voters. “We are happy with our register of voters. It is robust but will continue to see ways by which we can improve the quality of the register. “I am saying so because the credibility of any democratic election draws from the credibility of the register of voters. “In doing so, we hope to introduce a new technology for voters enrollment in 2021 drawing from the lessons we learnt in the last exercise in 2017 and 2018,” he said. Yakubu promised that in due course INEC would give details of other activities going to the 2023 election. “We have exactly 799 days to the next general election, holding on Feb. 18, 2023 . “We have identified 1508 activities that we must accomplish between now and election in 2023. Some will be carried out simultaneously,” he added.

Arsenal will not renew their interest in Lyon midfielder, Houssem Aouar, in the January window. The Athletic reports that the Gunners will instead pursue other targets. Mikel Arteta’s side is short of creativity after Mesut Ozil was frozen out, with a new playmaker now top priority when the window reopens. They had been expected to make another move for Aouar, having held extensive negotiations with Lyon over the summer. But the Frenchman has fallen down their wishlist since then. It is understood Arsenal will not rekindle their interest in the 22-year-old and are “prioritising other targets”. In addition to the fee Lyon would demand, Arsenal also have some “reservations” about Aouar, while the player himself has publicly committed to remaining with the club until the end of the season at least. The Premier League have been linked with the likes of Norwich’s Emiliano Buendia, Borussia Dortmund midfielder Julian Brandt and Barcelona’s Riqui Puig as alternatives.

Tottenham Hotspur’s clash against Fulham on Wednesday evening has been called off, due to a COVID-19 outbreak at the west London club. Fulham have posted a number of positive results in the first round of testing across the Premier League this week. Scott Parker’s side were due to face Tottenham in north London at 6pm on Wednesday. But the match is now the second fixture to be called off this week, after Manchester City’s clash with Everton was also postponed. In the latest round of testing across Premier League clubs, there were 18 positive COVID-19 results among players and staff, which is the highest figure since testing first began under ‘Project Restart’ in June.

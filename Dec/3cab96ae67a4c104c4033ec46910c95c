Nigerian singer, Bukola Elemide, popularly known as Asa has revealed that she is still single because she became selfish with herself and her time. Asa made this known after she was asked why she was still single during an interview with Bolanle Olukanni on Wednesday. The 36-year-old was also asked if she had future plans of getting married. In her response, Asa revealed that she was still single because she got too selfish, adding that she wasn’t in a hurry to get married to any man. According to her, “As I grew older, I discovered that I became selfish with myself. I love being alone from 3 am in the morning but by 8 o’clock, I’m ready to do or be with whoever it is. “That early morning routine is just about me and myself and it has always been profound because I make the best decisions by that time. “I really don’t know if anyone who wants to be with me would understand that I really love to be alone by that time. “I used to date someone. H was a good guy though, but I left because he couldn’t come to terms with the fact that I needed my space early in the morning. “I also feel like we could have different houses in the same compound or maybe different rooms so I can have my privacy when I need it, but I don’t know if anyone will be okay with that. “I really don’t have any issues of being alone if the marriage happens, but if it doesn’t happen I’m still very happy with how my life is at the moment,” she said.

The Lagos State Government has sealed off Cubana nightclub, Ikeja GRA, over failure to adhere to COVID-19 guidelines. Gboyega Akosile, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, confirmed the development in a tweet via his Twitter account on Sunday. According to him, the police led by the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, sent the club-goers out of the Cubana building before shutting the facility. “Lagos State Commissioner of @PoliceNG CP Odumosu personally led a team that dispersed club attendees before shutting down Cubana, Ikeja GRA for failing to comply with COVID19 guidelines,” he said. Recall that Governor Sanwo-Olu had earlier directed that all private schools and government in the state be shut down indefinitely. The Governor also directed all public servants from Grade Level 14 and below, except emergency workers and first responders, to work from home for the next two weeks starting from next week Monday. The governors’ directives came after the Federal Government announced a second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in the country. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859841 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7923-572x1024.jpg" alt="" width="572" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7923-572x1024.jpg 572w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7923-167x300.jpg 167w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7923-857x1536.jpg 857w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7923-1143x2048.jpg 1143w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7923.jpg 1234w" sizes="(max-width: 572px) 100vw, 572px"> <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859842 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7924-653x1024.jpg" alt="" width="653" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7924-653x1024.jpg 653w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7924-191x300.jpg 191w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7924-979x1536.jpg 979w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/IMG_7924.jpg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 653px) 100vw, 653px">

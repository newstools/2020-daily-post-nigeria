Okezie Ikpeazu, the Governor of Abia State suspended his Chief of Staff, Anthony Agbazuere, on Sunday. A statement by Chris Ezem, Secretary to the State Government, did not give a reason. Alozie Odoemelam, Permanent Secretary, Government House, will act until further notice. However, there are speculations from various quarters that Ikpeazu took the decision after a video of Agbazuere surfaced on the internet. In the clip, the ex-aide is seen spraying money on a cleric, Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere, popularly known as Odumeje. Nigerians are condemning Agbazuere and the Abia government for the “show off”. Odumeje (aka ‘Indaboski Bahose’, ‘Liquid Metal’, among others) is the leader of Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention Deliverance Ministry. Video: It shows a ridiculous level of being flippant in the corridors of power. This is a disrespectful attitude to Abians. He should be relieved of his post. The sack should be a Christmas gift to Abia state.3/3 pic.twitter.com/gFmAkakvTb — E.J. (@Enwagboso) December 6, 2020

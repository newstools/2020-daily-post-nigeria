Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, will be without two of his wingers in Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi when they take on Everton in the Premier League on Saturday. However, there is some good news, as Christian Pulisic is fit and available. Pulisic’s return is being carefully managed after another setback saw him miss a month with injury in November. With both Ziyech and Hudson-Odoi out as wide options, Lampard revealed that he withdrew the 22-year-old from the midweek Champions League match with Krasnodar as a precaution. “Christian is a work in progress. I don’t want to call this an injury that he had in midweek. If the game had been a different type of game, then maybe I would have used him. “He had a tiny bit of awareness off the back of the Leeds game on one of his hamstrings but he’s training normally, so we should be as we were. “Hakim Ziyech and Callum Hudson-Odoi are out for around a couple of weeks,” Lampard told reporters on Thursday.

The Coalition of Northern Groups, CNG, has threatened to embark on a nationwide protest if the government fails to rescue students kidnapped during a bandits’ attack on Government Science Secondary School Kankara, Katsina State. The Northwest Coordinator of the Coalition, Jamilu Aliyu Charanchi made this known during a press briefing held in the state capital, Channels Tv reports. Charanchi said thousands of protesters will be mobilised if the school pupils are not rescued as soon as possible. “We will like to state that if the government fails to rescue the missing students within the shortest time, we will not hesitate to embark on a protest until the students are fully rescued. “This will happen even if it’s going to cost us our lives,” Charanchi said. He also slammed President Muhammadu Buhari for not visiting the affected school, despite being in the state for a private visit. According to him, the insurgent attack on the school exposes the weakness of the government and its lack of concern for the educational sector. “The action of the government is inhuman, insensitive, ungodly and barbaric. “We, therefore, call for an immediate closure of all boarding secondary schools and the immediate deployment of security personnel to all secondary schools within the state,” he added.

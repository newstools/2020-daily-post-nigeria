A non-partisan group, Nigeria Equity Group (NEG) has called on political parties to ensure that a Christian is considered for the position of the president to further ensure balance and equity. The group on Tuesday in a press release signed by its convener, Dr Emeka Nwosu and Secretary, Alh. Muhammed Mubarak said geopolitical consideration should be a factor also. NEG stated in the statement that following 8 years of President Muhamadu Buhari, it will be fair to have a Christian for another 8 years. The group vowed to mobilize Nigerians to ensure the emergence of any candidate that fits the criteria. “Our position is that after an eight-year rule of a northern Muslim in 2023, it would only be fair and equitable that whoever takes over from him be a competent Southern Christian. The population of Nigeria is shared almost equally by Christians and Muslims and between the North and South, we, therefore, hold that, for the sake of equity, after the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari, a Northern Muslim, the position of the President should go to a Southern Christian in 2023,” the group stated. Adding that, “We wish to put it on notice and state strongly that we will mobilize similar organizations and indeed all Nigerians to work against any political party that does not follow this template in 2023.”

The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says 40 people died in 82 road accidents across Adamawa State between September 1 and December 9 this year. The FRSC adds that 203 people sustained injuries in the 82 accidents involving a total of 407 passengers. The Adamawa State Sector Commander of the FRSC, Ocheja Ameh, who announced the figures to newsmen in Yola on Friday, said the accidents involved 138 vehicles. He attributed the accidents to speed violations, tyre puncture, wrong overtaking and loss of control by drivers. He urged for patience and better road behaviours by drivers as Christmas draws nearer.

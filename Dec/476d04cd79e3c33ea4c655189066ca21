Juventus star, Cristiano Ronaldo has maintained that he never saw his Barcelona counterpart, Lionel Messi as a rival. The Portuguese captain’s comments came after Juventus brushed past Barcelona in a recent Champions League encounter. After suffering a 2-0 defeat in Turin and with Ronald absent due to COVID-9 recovery rules, Juventus travel to Spain and scored three unreplied goals against Messi-led Barcelona. Ronaldo scored two from the penalties spot with Weston McKennie also scoring one at Camp Nou. The goals helped Juve claimed a 3-0 win and top spot in Group G. Ronaldo, who shared a brief embrace with the Argentina captain before the clash, said there was no rivalry between the two all-time greats. “I have always had a very cordial relationship with him,” the Juve star told Movistar. “I shared 12, 13 or 14 years of award ceremonies with him. I never saw him as a rival. “He always tries to do what is best for his team and me too. I always got along very well with him. “But we know that in football, for the press, for the show, a rivalry is sought, but I have always gotten along well with him. I see him as always.”

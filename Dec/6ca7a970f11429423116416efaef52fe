Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has advised the people of the state not to allow themselves to be used by those he described as demagogues who try to turn them against because their faiths and tongues may differ. Governor El-Rufai in a Christmas message he released on Thursday, enjoined the people to commit to peace and goodwill to all and sundry. As Christians and Muslims, governor El-Rufai said they can emulate the example of Jesus Christ, adding, “We can strive to be better than we are today, combining our faith with exemplary conduct.” He prayed to God Almighty that the blessings and lessons of Christmas would spread all through the state and move to be better people. The governor noted that the festive aspects of the celebration of Christmas may be limited by the reality of the second wave of life-threatening Covid-19 infections. As people of faith, he said that the people know that God’s love is unlimited; that amidst the trials and tribulations that confront them, the Almighty still avails them many reasons for joy in His Grace and gratitude for His protections. According to El-Rufai, each and everyone has a vital duty of personal responsibility as part of the collective action that is essential to curbing the spread of Covid-19. He appealed to the residents to comply with the current public health regulations and practice personal responsibility by wearing their facemasks, observing social distance, washing their hands regularly with soap and water, and avoiding large gatherings, assuring that together COVID-19 could be beaten. El Rufai enjoined the people to make the state peaceful and safe for everyone by upholding peace and harmony. He enjoined the people in the state to celebrate Christmas and the New Year with the sense of responsibility that they observed during the Easter and two Eid celebrations that took place in this year of the deadly pandemic.

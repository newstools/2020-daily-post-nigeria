The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike on Thursday revealed reasons why he is still a member of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Wike said the hopes of Nigerians rests on no other party but the PDP. The Governor spoke during the commissioning of the reconstructed Aker base road in his state. Wike, who described himself and others he didn’t mention, as men of character, said if he was that kind of Governor, he would have joined the APC. “I know how many times people have tried to woo us. We say no, we cannot be wooed. We are here, we are here. We started with PDP, we will end up with PDP.” Wike said he has “no other political party to join,” insisting that the fate of Nigeria, solely depends on the opposition party. According to Wike, the PDP is a party Nigerians want and intimidation will not stop him and others who strongly believe in the party, adding, “We are men of character. We are people who stand by what they say. Not for pecuniary interest.” Wike said he wants the PDP to continue to give Nigerians that hope they are looking for. The Rivers Governor said he believes everybody is hoping that “by 2023, PDP will take over the reins of power. I am not talking about this state.”

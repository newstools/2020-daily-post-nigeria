The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has told president Muhammadu Buhari to urgently fix Nigeria if he does not want a second phase of protests nationwide. The cleric, while speaking with journalists in Akure on Wednesday, said president Buhari lacks constitutional power to stop legitimate protests in the country. Giwa also alleged politicians to have sponsored thugs to disrupt the peaceful protests embarked upon by some aggrieved Nigerians in October through November. He said,” President Buhari ought to have listened to the cries of Nigerians; he ought to have amended his ways also instead of allowing selfish politicians to send political thugs to disrupt the previous nationwide protests. “If he had done what Nigerians are yearning for, there wouldn’t have been any need for another protest. “Very simple, implement effective policies that will make Nigerians happy if you don’t want further protests. “Buhari’s presidency is a total waste of time voting having ruled the country since 2015.”

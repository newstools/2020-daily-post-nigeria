No fewer than two people were killed in Bakura Local Government Area of Zamfara State as PDP and APC supporters engaged themselves during their campaigns on Thursday in Bakura town. Our correspondent reliably gathered that the leader of the PDP thugs whose name was given as Baka Love was killed while one of the APC thugs was shot dead while trying to erect canopies where APC rally was to be held. Our reporters gathered that due to the serious tension that ravaged Bakura town as a result of security threats, PDP could not hold its rally in Bakura town. However, the Assistance inspector General of police (AIG), zone 10, Mr. Mohammed Mustapha said that the APC was not authorized to hold any rally yesterday in Bakura Local Government Area of the state. “PDP has always been a peaceful political party in the country and not only in Zamfara State. So the unaccepted attitude of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state is becoming worrisome,” he lamented. It was also gathered that both the PDP and APC supporters were moving around with dangerous weapons which made the AIG to force 24 hours curfew on Bakura and Talata Mafara Local Government Areas of the State. Our correspondent also reports that the former governor of the state, Alhaji Abdul Aziz Yari who stormed the APC campaign ground told the AIG that he has no constitutional right to cancel APC campaign since his party has obtained approval from security agencies in the state. This reporter can authoritatively report that many people were injured and many houses were set ablaze in six wards of Bakura Local Government Area of the state including the palace of a district head in Bakura Local Government Area of the state.

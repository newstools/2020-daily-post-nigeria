Istanbul Basaksehir striker, Demba Ba, on Tuesday night confronted fourth official, Sebastian Coltescu, over an alleged racist slur during his side’s abandoned Champions League tie with Paris Saint-Germain. The match was abandoned after players from both sides walked off the pitch, alleging Coltescu used a racial slur towards Basaksehir’s assistant coach, Pierre Webo, before he was sent off. The former Cameroon international had to be dragged away as he repeatedly yelled, “Why did you say n****?” with the rest of the Basaksehir coaches and substitutes in uproar. However, in a video which emerged online, Demba Ba, a former Chelsea forward, confronted the official on the touchline, saying: “You never say: “This white guy”. You say: “This guy”. “So why when you mention a black guy do you have to say: “This black guy”? But seriously, I don’t get it!”. Meanwhile, UEFA had rescheduled the Champions League game between PSG and Istanbul Basaksehir, after it was suspended on Tuesday night. The game will be played with a different set of officials on Wednesday with UEFA promising a full investigation. Watch Video.. “You never this say ‘this white guy’, you say ‘this guy’, so why when you mention… listen to me… so why when you mention a black guy [do] you have to say ‘this black guy?'”

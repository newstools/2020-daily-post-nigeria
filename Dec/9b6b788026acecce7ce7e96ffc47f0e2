The Katsina State Government has confirmed the rescue of the abducted students of Government Science Secondary School in Kankara area of the state. This was disclosed by President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad via his Twitter handle. According to Ahmad: “The abducted students of the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara have been rescued, the Katsina State Government has confirmed the news. Alhamdulillah.” Recall that Boko Haram had last week abducted about 600 students from GSSS in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State. A few days later, Boko Haram had claimed responsibility for the abduction. Leader of the terrorist group, Abubakar Shekau had said the students were abducted to promote Islam and downplay the importance of western education. On Thursday, the insurgent released a video claiming it has custody of the abducted students. The clip which is six-minute-and-30-second long, shows scores of young boys behind him, all covered in dust within a forest area.

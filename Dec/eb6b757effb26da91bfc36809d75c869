Uche Seconds, the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Saturday, called for President Muhammadu Buhari’s resignation. Secondus said Buhari should resign for admitting that his administration has failed to protect Nigerians. Recall that Buhari had yesterday lamented over his inability to achieve his responsibility of ensuring the protection of Nigerians. The president had spoken in Daura, Katsina State, following the release of the abducted students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara. However, Secondus said Buhari should give way for fresh ideas because he can’t live up to his responsibilities. The PDP National Chairman, in a statement by his spokesman, Ike Abonyi said the president should stop giving excuses for his failure. According to Secondus: “Buhari should do the honourable thing and resign after he admited failure of his administration on insecurity. “And this ‘competent hand’ happened to be President Buhari whose five years in office has left the country comatose in all ramifications. “I find it extremely unacceptable that after the President disregarded all wise counsel to rejig the nation’s security architecture for effectiveness, he is now turning round to admit their failure and blame operatives whom he kept even in their apparent inefficiency”.

The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has condoled with the family, friends of Leadership Newspaper over the loss of their publisher, Sam Nda -Isaiah. Lawan in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Saturday commiserated with the Government and people of Niger State over the loss. He described Nda-Isaiah’s death as a shocking and sad one praying that God gives his family the heart to bear the loss. “Sam Nda-Isaiah fervently believed in the Nigerian project and this is reflected in his writings and the editorial focus and tone of his Leadership Newspaper. “His contributions as a public opinion shaper and principled politician are profound and have put his imprints on the Nigerian history despite his early home call,” he said. He also prayed for sweet repose of his soul and comfort for his loved ones in this period of their grief.

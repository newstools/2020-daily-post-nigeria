The only member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the House of Representatives from Kano State, Aliu Detti has decamped to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The lawmaker announced his defection to the ruling party in a letter read on the floor of the House. Detti, in a re-run election, defeated Abdulmummin Jibrin of the APC in January 2020, following a court judgement that nullified Abdulmummin’s election. According to Detti, he is leaving the party because of the leadership crisis facing it in Kano State. “I would like to notify the House and the general public that I have left the PDP to the APC due to incessant fighting and fractionalization in the Party.” Raising a point of order, the minority Leader, Ndudi Elumelu disregarding the taunting of the Speaker raised a point of order. While standing on section 68 of the 1999 Constitution Elumelu called for the seat of the lawmaker to be declared vacant. “When you were reading the illegal decamping letter, the lawmaker said that there is a crisis in the state party. I can inform you that I have spoken to the state party and my national party, no crisis exists in our party.” Responding to the motion, Gbajabiamila said the minority leader will have to prove that there is no crisis if he intends to dispute the statement of Detti.

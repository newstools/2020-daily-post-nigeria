The Federal Government has said that some religious organisations were sabotaging the national response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the country by holding large gatherings events contrary to laid down coronavirus protocols. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman, Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Mr Boss Mustapha, stated this on Thursday in Abuja at the joint national briefing of the task force. According to Mustapha, the PTF had continued to engage with relevant stakeholders on issues arising from the impact of COVID-19, including mental health, drug use and gender-based violence. “We have observed, rather sadly, that Nigerians, particularly some faith-based organisations, have continued to hold events of large gatherings capable of spreading the virus. “The PTF urges all sub-national entities that signed the protocols with these organisations, and have primary responsibility for enforcing the protocols, to step up their roles of enforcement,” Mustapha said. Meanwhile, The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Thursday night confirmed 675 new cases of COVID-19 infections across 15 states, with the fatality toll rising to 1,190.

Leading technology-based transportation and logistics company, MAX.ng celebrated the 2020 Christmas Day with Ibadan Home for Motherless Babies and Dorcas Adunola Oyediji Motherless Babies Home in Ibadan, Oyo State. As part of its Social-Good Drive, MAX.ng presented several food items and COVID-19 safety materials to the charity homes. The initiative aligns with the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility strategy. MAX.ng’s representative, Ms Fadekemi Adefemi said the donations provided an exciting opportunity for staff to interact with the children and appreciate the good work the social workers are doing. Ibadan Motherless Babies Home is an abode uniquely set up for newborns who lost their mothers at childbirth. The babies are nursed from age zero to three years and then delivered to their fathers or families. Mrs Modupe Adeyemi, Chief Matron of Dorcas Oyediji Home, identified inadequate funding and a shortfall of volunteers as some of the challenges they struggle with daily. “MAX.ng’s contribution will meet some of these needs. We are urging other individuals and organisations to devote their time and resources to support orphanage homes in Nigeria”, she appealed. MAX.ng continues to make contributions to positively impact lives. The company not only ensures diversity and wellbeing of its workforce, it continuously harnesses their talents and skills.

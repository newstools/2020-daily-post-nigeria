The Federal Controller of Works in Lagos State, Olukayode Popoola, has hinted that the Third Mainland Bridge might be closed next week during the yuletide holidays. Speaking with NAN, Popoola lamented the disruptive activities of miscreants popularly called ‘area boys’, who sometimes open the closed section of the bridge to traffic to endanger the safety of motorists. He admitted that their actions have disrupted the work of contractors but insisted that the project is progressing well. “On the Island-bound lane where we are working now, the contractor is ready to cast another three expansion joints this weekend, but because of the festive period, we have a lot of vehicles on the road. “We were advised to leave it until next week, maybe during the public holiday where we will do the total closure,” Popoola said. According to him, the work on the surface of the bridge was over 70 percent completed, but the entire project was 22 per cent completed.

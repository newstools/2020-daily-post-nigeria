Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, could not hide his frustration after missing out on this year’s FIFA Best Men’s Player award, Sporting Life reports. The 35-year-old picked up the prestigious individual award in 2016 and 2017. But Ronaldo has been forced to wait to win his third ever since. In 2018, the former Real Madrid star missed out to Luka Modric, while Lionel Messi beat him to the 2019 gong. And in 2020, despite making the three-man shortlist yet again, Ronaldo lost out to Lewandowski. Lewandowski, 32, scored 60 goals in just 52 games during the eligible period. The Poland international also helped Bayern Munich secure an historic treble – including the Bundesliga and Champions League crowns – in 2019/2020.

Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted Monday’s night Premier League clash between Chelsea and West Ham. Frank Lampard’s men have dropped off in the title race after suffering back-to-back defeats against Everton and Wolves. Berbatov, speaking to BetFair, admits that their London derby against the Hammers is a “must-win” fixture. “This is a must win for Chelsea in my opinion, I think they are going to have a tough time in this one but I think they will just edge it, they need to. “West Ham have been playing well and I think they will certainly take the game to Chelsea. Prediction 2-1,” Berbatov said. A win for Chelsea will see them climb as high as fifth place.

Thankfully, the governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu,understoodour vision and gave us the support we needed to establish the academy here in Lagos, the hub of Nigerian filmmaking,” she said. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859538 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ELCA-002-Acting-for-Sreen-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="740" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ELCA-002-Acting-for-Sreen-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ELCA-002-Acting-for-Sreen-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ELCA-002-Acting-for-Sreen-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ELCA-002-Acting-for-Sreen-80x80.jpg 80w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ELCA-002-Acting-for-Sreen.jpg 1304w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"> The Governor of Lagos State, Mr Sanwo-Olu said, “We are very excited about this development because it is in line with two of the development pillars of our THEMES agenda – education & technology and entertainment & tourism.

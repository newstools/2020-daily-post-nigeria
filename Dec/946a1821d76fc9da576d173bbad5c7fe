Besides the slash in price, buyers are given 50kg bag of rice throughout December and for agents who broker the transaction, the enterprising and real estate firm is offering them a 10% agency fee, instead of the conventional 5 per cent. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859110 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WhatsApp-Image-2020-12-12-at-7.38.54-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WhatsApp-Image-2020-12-12-at-7.38.54-PM.jpeg 960w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WhatsApp-Image-2020-12-12-at-7.38.54-PM-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"> This promo is a continuation of the firm’s slash-in-price property offer aimed at ameliorating the economic effects of COVID-19. The company had given a Honda Crosstour to her best agent last year. The move to increase agents with 10% is to give back to the society and assist the government in bridging the unemployment gap as the government alone cannot do it. This move would create more jobs for our youths. As part of its December Discount promo, the real estate developer is also offering for sale plot of land in its T Pumpy Kiddies Estate. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859113 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WhatsApp-Image-2020-12-01-at-5.09.00-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="987" height="822" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WhatsApp-Image-2020-12-01-at-5.09.00-PM.jpeg 987w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/WhatsApp-Image-2020-12-01-at-5.09.00-PM-300x250.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 987px) 100vw, 987px">  According to Adaralegbe, the MD/CEO of the company: “With N399, 000, your child is a landowner with certificate of occupancy.

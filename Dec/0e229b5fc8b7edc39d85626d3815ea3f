The lawmaker representing Idanre/Ifedore Federal Constituency of Ondo State, Tajudeen Adefisoye, also known as ‘Small Alhaji’ has officially decamped from the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila announced Adefisoye’s move on Wednesday, while reading a letter from the lawmaker addressed to the House. Adefisoye who was not on the floor of the House said he is leaving SDP due to “irreconcilable differences in the party. He also said the party is “having factions at state and national level.” Responding to the letter, the Minority Leader of the House, Ndudi Elumelu said the letter should be suspended since the latter was not on the floor of the House. “As provided in the constitution, there is provision for a fair hearing, since he is not around, I think we should step the letter down. He is not here to defend himself, we are not sure he wrote the letter.” The Speaker in his ruling said there is a “presumption of regularity.”

Their release was made public by Bebe Cool, a Uganda singer, on Tuesday. The Ugandan police had arrested both singers over their involvement in an unauthorised concert held on Saturday night in Ddungu Resort in Munyonyo, Kampala City. The pair were thereafter remanded in police custody alongside four Ugandans after they were arraigned before a court.

The Federal Government has said that men of the police force are now afraid to wear their uniforms due to the unfortunate events that led to the death of some police officers during the End SARS protest. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who made this known during an interview with newsmen in Lagos on Friday, called on Nigerians to empathize with and appreciate personnel of the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies instead of victimizing them. The minister recalled that six soldiers and 37 policemen were killed across the country during the crisis. He said that while 196 policemen were injured, 164 police vehicles were destroyed, with 134 police stations burnt. “Today, many of them are even afraid to wear their uniforms and the result has not been pleasant, in terms of security of life and property. “I want to remind all of us of the saying that a society that makes war against its police had better learnt to make friends with its criminals. “While everyone was fixated on the fake massacre at Lekki Toll Gate, a few paid attention to the way and manner policemen and soldiers were killed. “In particular, policemen were hacked down in the most gruesome manner that calls into question the sanity of their killers. “Yet, these security agents were treated as sub-humans,” he said. He also noted that no life was more important than the other, adding that respect for human rights should not be selective.

A 40-year-old man, Etifa Obukulubu, has given reason he killed a pastor with the New Baptist Church and a young woman. He claimed that he caught his estranged girlfriend in bed with the pastor. DAILY POST recalls that the suspect’s girlfriend, Elvina Japheth Abilo was burnt to death at the Igbogene-Apie area of Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa State on Saturday, October 31. The Pastor also died the same day. While being paraded alongside 45 suspects of various crimes, Obukulubu, told the police that he acted in anger after peeping through the window to see the pastor on top of his girlfriend. “It was due to anger that I carried out the arson. We have been dating for four years and this year, between October 30 and 31, I realised that my girlfriend was always going to the pastor’s house every time I was not at home,” the suspect said. “When I found out the affair between the pastor and my girlfriend, I became angry and all I could think of at the time was to set them ablaze. It was anger that made me set the house ablaze. “I caught them red-handed sleeping on the bed after I peeped through the window,” he added.

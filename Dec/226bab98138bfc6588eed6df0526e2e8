Former Kano Governor, Engr Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso has explained why Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje dethroned Muhammad Sanusi II as Emir of Kano. He told Ganduje, “you dethroned him for your inferiority complex against him, nothing more.” Senator Kwankwaso noted in a press statement signed by his Principal Private Secretary, Muhammad Inuwa Ali on Tuesday, that “the fears of high esteem and caliber, plus influence the Emir possesses made Ganduje jittery and insisted on dethroning him.” Kwankwaso said; “We know that Ganduje always feels diminished and inferior in the presence of the Emir, and we know that Gov Ganduje harbours a pathological hatred for the Kano Traditional Institution, that was why he had to dethrone him. “We also know that Ganduje was madly obsessed with reversing everything that Sen. Kwankwaso did in the state. And we are aware, for these reasons, Gov. Ganduje was set, ab initio, to destroy the Kano Emirate. And Emir Sanusi II was marked to be the first victim. “Let me also put on record that Emir Sanusi II was abducted and illegally dethroned by Gov. Ganduje and his cohorts because of the Emir’s progressive ideas on various issues that affect the people of the State.” Kwankwaso said that Sanusi’s removal had nothing to do with former President Goodluck Jonathan. He said, Everyone knows that Ganduje’s desperation to obtain the $1.8 billion loan and the former Emir’s criticism of the loan is what fuelled the illegal removal of Emir Sanusi II; it had nothing to do with former President Jonathan. “It is common knowledge that the Emir was too progressive for Gov. Ganduje’s liking and that was exactly why after his illegal removal and the dismemberment of the Kano Emirate Council, he appointed Emirs that will not question his ill-advised decisions even if they are against the interest of the state and its people.”

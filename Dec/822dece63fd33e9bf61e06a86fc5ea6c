Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has insisted he won’t lose confidence over how well Tottenham Hotspur are playing. Ahead of their Premier League clash on Wednesday night, Klopp has told Spurs boss Jose Mourinho, that “it is business as usual”. “Tottenham have the quality of the top teams and when they have the ball they show that. “They defend like a top team and at the moment probably have the best counter-attacking movements. “It is not that they play just a little bit of football, they are a proper package at the moment but that doesn’t cost me confidence when I think about my team. It is business as usual,” Klopp said. Tottenham are currently top of the table with 25 points, only ahead of Liverpool on goals difference.

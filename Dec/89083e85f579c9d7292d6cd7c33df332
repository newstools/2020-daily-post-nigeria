Liverpool manager (German) Jurgen Klopp would be able to receive a number of key personnel ahead of the Red’s tricky clash with Wolverhampton Wanderers this weekend. Klopp will have to battle with increased selection problems as his injury-laden team entertain Wolves at home in the League. The former Borussia Dortmund tactician reiterated that some sect of his players picked up recurring injury in the Red’s midweek fixture with Ajax (Dutch side) in the UEFA Champions League. But he was also convinced that a number of them are likely to make a return for the Premier League clash against Nuno Espirito Santo’s men. In goal, the English Champions would still be without the Brazilian goalkeeper Alisson (Becker), who copped a hamstring issue at the beginning of the week. Caoimhin Kelleher should start once again after featuring in the midweek. One real boost for Liverpool will be the availability of defender Trent Alexander-Arnold who returned and took part in the preparatory session on Friday. He is most likely going to start in the company of Joel Matip, and Nathaniel Philips, with Andrew Robertson featuring at the left-back. Despite some worries about the veteran picking up a slight strain against Dutch side Ajax, Jordan Henderson is supposed to start in the middle along with Fabinho. Guinea’s Naby Keita returned to training on Friday but may not get to start due to his injury record amid certain precautionary measures. In the attack, Liverpool would welcome some level of continuity in picking up a familiar quartet upfront in Diogo Jota, Roberto Firmino Sadio Mane and Egypt’s superstar Mohamed Salah. Possible line up may include Caoimhin Kelleher; Trent Alexander Arnold, Joel Matip, Nathaniel Philips, Andrew Robertson; Fabinho, Jordan Henderson; Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino, Diogo Jota.

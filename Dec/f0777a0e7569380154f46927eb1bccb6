The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, on Thursday, officially declared the second wave of the virus in Nigeria. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, stated this during the daily media briefing. Mustapha, who has tested positive himself, was represented by Aviation Minister Hadi Sirika. According to him, Nigeria has entered a second wave of infections and stands the risk of losing the gains from the hard work of the last nine months. Mustapha said the PTF believes that “if we do the right things, adhere to the Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) and step up our testing and detection, loss of lives will be minimized and the rising curve will begin to flatten out.” According to him, while the country in the last two weeks on the one hand, received cheering news of the COVID-19 vaccine on the other hand, “we have witnessed spikes in number of infections at home and abroad. The real threat is upon humanity and the progress made in the global health sector in the last five decades or more.” He said Nigeria’s cumulative numbers in the last weeks of 49-51 showed: “Week 49 – 1,843; Week 50 – 3,918 and Week 51 (Mon-Wed): 1,889.

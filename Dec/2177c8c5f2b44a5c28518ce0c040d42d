The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, has hinted that insurgency and terrorism may continue in Nigeria for another 20 years. Buratai made the remark on his verified Facebook handle few days after Boko Haram massacred rice farmers in Borno State. Boko Haram had beheaded about 110 rice farmers in Zabarmari, Jere Local Government Area of Borno State. However, Buratai noted that Nigerians generally misunderstand what insurgency and terrorism mean. According to the Army boss: “There is general misunderstanding of what insurgency and terrorism entail. There is likelihood of terrorism persisting in Nigeria for another 20 years. “Citizens responsibility is equally important and imperative. All must cooperate to contain the lingering insecurity. Let there be collective action and responsibility.”

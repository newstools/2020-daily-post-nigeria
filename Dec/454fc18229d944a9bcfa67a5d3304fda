Malam Adamu Adamu, the Minister of Education, has insisted that many Nigerian graduates can’t read or write applications. Adamu said this while lamenting the continuous fall in the standard of education in Nigeria. The minister, who spoke in Yola, the Adamawa State during the official commissioning of completed projects in the college on Friday, decried a situation in which many graduates can’t read or write in a tolerable manner. According to him, the situation was a cause for concern, adding that Nigerian students and teachers need to sit up and face their tasks directly if the situation is to be reversed. “Some graduates of tertiary institutions across the country cannot read or write applications,” Adamu, who was represented by Hajia Rakiya Gambo Iliyasu, the Director of Tertiary Education in the Federal Ministry of Education said, the Nation reports. Adamu, however, urged all stakeholders in the education sector to sit up to ensure that the decline in the value of education in the country is bridged within the shortest time possible.

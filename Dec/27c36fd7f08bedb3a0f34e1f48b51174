Senior players in the Manchester United squad are concerned about Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s constant tactical changes. According to the UK Telegraph, they believe it is having a negative impact on the team’s form. United crashed out of the Champions League this week following a 3-2 defeat against RB Leipzig. The latest setback has piled even more pressure on Solskjaer, although it is believed he still has the complete backing of the club’s hierarchy. However, some players believe his tendency to make frequent personnel and tactical changes have been detrimental to results. They want Solskjaer to be more consistent with his team selection and tactics going forward. Solskjaer has not named the same starting XI in consecutive matches this season and continues to experiment with his formations, with United alternating between a four-man defence and three-man backline with wing-backs.

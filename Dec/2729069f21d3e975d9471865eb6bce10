The Air Component of Operation Thunder Strike has killed scores of bandits in Kaduna State barely 24 hours after killing many in Kaduru forest in the state. The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, in a statement on Monday, said the latest attack took place at the Kusasu area of the state on Sunday. He said the hit was achieved following human intelligence reports, which led to the identification of the camp of a bandits’ leader, known as Alhaji Labi.
According to him, Labi is an associate of Dogon Gede, a notorious bandits’ leader in Katsina State. “The attack aircraft took turns in engaging the location, delivering devastating hits which destroyed the bandits’ structures, including their logistics storage facilities, which were seen engulfed in flames. “Several bandits were also killed in the attack. “The Armed Forces of Nigeria and other security agencies remained resolute in the fight against banditry and other sundry crimes and will not relent until normalcy is restored to all troubled zones of the country,” he said.

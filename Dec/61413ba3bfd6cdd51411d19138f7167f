Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has named Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Luke Shaw as the three players that made the ‘difference’ during the Red Devils’ Carabao Cup 2-0 win over Everton on Wednesday night. Solskjaer said that Rashford, Martial and Shaw displayed strength and power against Everton when they came on the pitch in the second half of the encounter. Man United defeated Everton at Goodison Park, thanks to two goals from Anthony Martial and Edinson Cavani. Solskjaer’s side will now tackle Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-final in January 2021. “You never know what’s going to happen in a game of football. The first goal always changes the game,” Solskjaer told MUTV. “As long as we were in the game, I knew they [Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial] could come on and make an impact. You know how quick and sharp they are, how powerful and strong. “So we tried to swap around a little bit the dynamics of the game. Even Luke [Shaw], when he comes on, has got that strength and power to drive down that side. “It’s important to have a squad and have players that can come in and make a difference, and they did.”

Former Manchester United star, Michael Owen, has expressed his delight with striker, Marcus Rashford’s performance in their 3-2 win over Sheffield United in the Premier League on Thursday. Owen described Rashford’s display against Sheffield as ‘excellent’, adding that the England international was a real danger during the encounter. Two goals from Marcus Rashford and a strike from Anthony Martial gave Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men all three points against Sheffield at Bramall Lane. Speaking about Rashford, Owen told Amazon Prime Sport: “I thought his movement was excellent, his timing of the runs too. “I never thought he was a central player. He never played that at youth level, he always wanted to be a number ten or a wide player. It suits him, and it suits Martial, he is the best out of the two to play down the middle. “His (Rashford) ‘s running off the ball was a real danger. They’re one of the best counter-attacking teams in the country.”

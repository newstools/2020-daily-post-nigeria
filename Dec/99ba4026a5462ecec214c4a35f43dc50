The Bauchi State Police Command has ordered a total restriction of movement of persons and vehicles in Dass Local Government Area of the state where a bye-election for the Dass state constituency will be held tomorrow, Saturday, December 5, 2020. This is even as the command equally called on the electorate in the constituency to come out en masse and exercise their franchise tomorrow without any fear of intimidation from any person or group of persons, assuring that the police and other security agencies will deal with any miscreants, political thugs and disgruntled elements. The bye-election is being held to fill the vacant seat vacated by the former lawmaker occupying the seat, Honourable Musa Mante Baraza, who was murdered by unknown gunmen in his residence in Dass on August 13, 2020. The restriction of movement was announced by the command’s Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Ahmed Mohammed Wakil, in a press release he signed on behalf of the state Commissioner of Police, Tanko Lawan Jimeta and made available to DAILY POST, adding that it is in line with provisions of the Electoral Act and for the purpose of smooth conduct of the election. The restriction, according to Wakil, would be effective between Friday midnight and 4pm on Saturday, adding that those on essential duties are, however, exempted from the restriction. “There will be total restriction of movement of persons and vehicles in Dass L.G.A and its environs between midnight of Friday, 4th December, 2020 to 4:00pm Saturday, 5th December, 2020, except those on essential duties who must carry their valid identification card,” the police spokesman stated. The police also barred important personalities and politicians (VIPs) from going to any polling unit with their security details or orderlies, warning them “to desist from moving from one polling unit to another on Election Day.” Wakil further stated that only statutory security agencies recognized by law would be allowed to provide security for the bye election. “However, in view of the present global COVID-19 pandemic, the CP ordered all DPOs/HODs to warn their personnel to ensure that the Covid-19 safety measures are duly observed throughout the period of the election,” the police spokesman stated While assuring the people of the state of their readiness for the bye election by putting in place adequate security measures, the command called on parents, traditional rulers, religious leaders, opinion leaders and guardians to prevail on their children and subjects not to allow themselves to be used to foment troubles before, during or after the election. “The Bauchi State Police Command wish to assure the good people of Bauchi State that it has put in place adequate security measures and will provide a level playing ground for all political parties for the peaceful conduct of the forthcoming state House of Assembly Bye Election scheduled for Saturday 05/12/2020 across ten (10) wards seventy two polling units (72) and eighty six (86) voting units. “The Command equally calls on the members of the public to come out en masse and cast their vote on the Election Day without any fear of intimidation from any person or group of persons, as the police and other security agencies will be all out to deal with any miscreant, political thugs, disgruntled elements that may attempt to foment trouble during and after the election according to the law. “Finally, the command calls on parents, traditional rulers, religious leaders, opinion leaders, and guardians to prevail on their children and subjects not to allow themselves to be used to cause disturbance of public peace before, during or after the election as anybody arrested in the act will face the full wrath of the law,” DSP Wakil warned.

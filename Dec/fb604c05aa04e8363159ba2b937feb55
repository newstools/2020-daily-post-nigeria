The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, has admitted that the standard of education in the country is declining. Adamu said this while speaking at the commissioning of 7 various projects at the Federal College of Education, Yola. The Minister said most graduating students of tertiary institutions across the country do not know how to read or write English which is a serious concern that needs to be addressed. “Many graduating students in many tertiary institutions across the country find it difficult to write, read or communicate in English. “Government is aware of this unfortunate development in our education sector and is not resting on its oars to salvage the situation. “Education Administrators need to wake up from their slumber.” Adamu Adamu, who was represented by the Director, Tertiary Education, Hajia Rakiya Iliyasu beckoned on graduates to brace up with the challenges of modern education. The Minister said not only the “lecturers but stakeholders in the educational sector should also sit up to ensure that the decline in the value of education is breached within the shortest possible time”. He added that the major problem controlling students learning is the involvement in anti-social activities, which he said has turned many students into fulltime criminals.

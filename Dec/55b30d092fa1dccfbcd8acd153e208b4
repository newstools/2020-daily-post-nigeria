Justice Rosemary Dugbo Oghoghorie of the Federal High Court, Enugu, has convicted and sentenced Okoro Tochukwu Joseph to eight months imprisonment. He was jailed for impersonation and obtaining by false pretence to the tune of $15,000. Joseph, a final year student of the Institute of Management Technology (IMT), was prosecuted by the Enugu Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). In one of the five-count charges, EFCC said Joseph, on March 11, 2020 in Enugu, claimed to be Donald Wood, a financial investor in crypto currency. Joseph was accused of sending a message through Google Hangout “for the purpose of causing needless anxiety” to the victim, Lisa Spitler, an American. The offence contravenes Section 24 (b) of the Cyber Crimes (Prohibition, Prevention, etc) Act, 2015. Joseph pleaded guilty to the charges. Prosecution counsel, Henry Onyekachi Anasoh asked the court to convict and sentence him accordingly. In addition to the prison term, the convict must restitute $15,000 to Spitler through the EFCC.

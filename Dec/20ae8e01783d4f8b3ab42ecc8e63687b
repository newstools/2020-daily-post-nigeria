The All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to the call on President Muhammadu Buhari by a federal lawmaker to resign or be impeached. On Sunday, Kingsley Chinda, the member representing Obio/Akpor Constituency of Rivers State said Buhari should go. In his release titled ‘Nigeria saddled with the circus’, Chinda urged on constituents to force their representatives to commence an impeachment process. In his rejoinder, APC spokesman, Yekini Nabena, noted that the party has no intention of joining issues with the “crass statement”. Nabena called Chinda, “a purported factional leader of the PDP Caucus in the House of Representatives” who resorted to denigrate the office and person of the President by name-calling and insults”. APC said the lawmaker’s insensitive and callous intention is to play politics with the grief of citizens in the aftermath of the recent, gruesome and condemnable killings of some Zabarmari farmers in Borno by Boko Haram. “The APC will not join Chinda and his PDP backers on this evil and ignoble road. We have since learnt that Chinda does not even have the support of any of the PDP House factions he claims to head. “He is a lone, rejected voice. The House of Representatives has already dismissed Chinda’s rant as illogical, self-serving and a ploy to derail the proposed visit of the President to the House. “The leadership of the National Assembly, the President and Armed Forces which the president heads as Commander in chief are on the same page in tackling emerging security situations in the country and ensure the safety of all Nigerians”, the statement read. Earlier, Reps spokesman, Benjamin Kalu, insisted that Chinda was alone in his call for the removal of Buhari.

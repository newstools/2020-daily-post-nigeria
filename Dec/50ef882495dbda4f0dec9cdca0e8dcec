The Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, Makurdi Branch, has called on the Federal Government to declare a State of emergency on security in the country following the killing of their colleague, Barrister Moses Udam and his pregnant wife by armed herdsmen. DAILY POST reports that Chairman of the NBA in the State, Barrister Justin Gbagir, made the call during a solidarity visit to Governor Samuel Ortom on Thursday. Gbagir also called for the establishment of a Victims’ Support Commission to cater and compensate victims of attacks in the country. The NBA also urged the Federal government to establish the North Central Development Commission to rehabilitate parts of the region which have been affected by the destruction caused by herdsmen and bandits. “We would be boycotting courts on Monday, 21st December 2020 to mourn our departed member and colleague Barrister Moses Udam and his pregnant wife who were killed by this ruthless herdsmen. “Also, we will ensure that the FG is taken to Court for neglecting its duty of protecting lives,” he said. Reacting, Ortom reiterated his call on the Federal Government to allow responsible Nigerians to own guns for self defence, stressing that if the deceased lawyer had a means of protection, he would have defended himself. He stated that herdsmen now target Livestock Guards and Agro Rangers who are preventing them from taking over the land in the guise of grazing, pointing out that it was painful for a young man with such prospect to be murdered in that manner. The Governor pledged continued support for the Nigerian Bar Association in order to promote law and order.

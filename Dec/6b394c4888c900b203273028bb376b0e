Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has launched the Eastern Security Network, ESN. Kanu explained that the ESN was launched to protect the Southeast from marauding Fulani herdsmen and other criminal elements. The IPOB leader also disclosed that ESN was not different from Amotekun in the Southwest and Miyetti Allah in the North. Kanu’s launch of ESN was disclosed in a statement signed by IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful. He warned armed robbers, kidnappers, to vacate the Southeast or be prepared “for the worst.” Kanu vowed that the new security outfit will adequately defend the Southeast. He also disclosed that mobile numbers would be released so people can call whenever there is any case of criminality in the region. Kanu lamented that terrorists have converted forest in the Southeast into slaughter grounds and raping fields. The statement reads partly: “We the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) under the command and leadership of our great leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, wish to announce with delight, that IPOB has floated a special security network to guard and protect the whole of Biafraland from Fulani herdsmen terrorists and other criminal groups. “The sole aim of this newly formed Security outfit known as Eastern Security Network (ESN), is to halt every criminal activity and terrorists attack in Biafraland. “This outfit which is a vigilante group like the Amotekun in the South West and the Miyetti Allah security outfit will ensure the safety of our forests and farm lands which terrorists have converted into slaughter grounds and raping fields.”

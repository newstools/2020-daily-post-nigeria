The Nigeria Association of Women Journalists (NAWOJ) has appealed to the military and other security agencies to, as a matter of national interest and concern, step up their fight against terrorists and bandits in the country. It also condemned in strong terms the barbaric killing of innocent rice farmers in Zabarmari area of Borno State. In a statement jointly signed by the National President, Mrs. Ladi Bala and National Secretary, Mrs. Helen, NAWOJ said the battle must be won for Nigerians and for a better Nigeria. According to the statement, “We welcome the marching order by President Muhammadu Buhari to the military to take the battle to the enclave of the terrorists.” The leadership of the association noted that the senseless killing of innocent Nigerians in any part of the country is totally unacceptable and must be checked and stopped decisively. It said it is equally saddened by the rising rate of insecurity and threat to lives, particularly in the Northeast region and the need for concerted efforts by government at all levels in tackling the situation. “NAWOJ is particularly expressed concern that it is equally saddened by the increasing spate of insecurity and constant threat to lives of Nigerians across the country and calls for renewed efforts to make the states particularly the North-east region safe again. “The incessant killings have rendered many women to untimely widowhood with its attendant consequences on the future of their children and society, a development that spells doom for the future..” The leadership of NAWOJ appealed to Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno state to give widows of the deceased appointments as alternative sources of income to alleviate their sufferings. NAWOJ then commiserated with the government and the people of Borno State over the incident, which it described as callous, inhuman, ugly, unfortunate and unacceptable.

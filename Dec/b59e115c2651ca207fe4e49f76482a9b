A former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has insisted that playmaker, Mesut Ozil, needs support and an environment that pushes him to give his best at the club. Wenger said this ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash with Southampton on Wednesday night. The Frenchman brought Ozil to the Emirates from Real Madrid in the summer of 2013 when he was still in charge of the North London club. Ozil, 32, has not played for Arsenal under manager, Mikel Arteta, since football resumed after the COVID-19 lockdown. The ex-Germany international was also dropped from Arsenal’s 25-man Europa League squad. “He [Mesut Ozil] was not difficult to manage. He was a guy who had a special quality as a creative player and needed to have fun,” Wenger said as quoted by Daily Mail. “He’s an artist, and these guys are a bit more sensitive. They need support and an environment that pushes them to give their best. “You’ve got a more creative player in the team who can do less defensive work, but you build a team around him who can compensate for these deficiencies. “That is what you’ve to think about.”

The police have discovered another baby factory in Ogun State. DAILY POST reports that this is coming barely two days after one was discovered at Ofada area of the state. Men of Ogun State Police Command said the baby factory was located at Lagos Street, Adesan in Mowe area of Obafemi Owode Local Government, Ogun. The state police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST that the discovery of the home followed a complaint from concerned residents of the area, who informed the police at Mowe divisional headquarters that a particular building located in their area was suspected to be a baby-making factory. According to the residents, “most of the women seen in the building are always with pregnancy and whenever they were delivered, they hardly see them with babies.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-857542" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-11.jpg" alt="" width="1080" height="810" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-11.jpg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-11-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/unnamed-11-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> “They stated further that from their observation, the babies are being sold,” Oyeyemi told DAILY POST. On the strength of the information, the DPO of Mowe division, SP Marvis Jayeola, had led his men to the area where a man suspected to be working for the operator of the home was arrested with four women and four children. One of the women, the police said, is heavily pregnant, as one of them was said to have just been delivered of a baby, which was suspected to have been sold. According to the police, preliminary investigation revealed that the home is strongly linked to the same Mrs. Florence Ogbonna, who was described as “a notorious baby factory operator who had earlier been arrested for similar offence and has her case pending in court.” The Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has ordered that the said Florence Ogbonna be searched for and arrested as soon as possible.

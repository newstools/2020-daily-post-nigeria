Former Super Eagles star, Osase Peter Odemwingie, has again tendered a public apology to the family of ex-Nigerian captain, Kanu Nwankwo. This time, Osaze went further to reveal what he saw in the person of Amara, wife of Kanu when he (Osaze) met her in Watford, England. Osaze had in an Instagram post lambasted Amara, accusing the Arsenal legend’s wife of chasing him, calling her Delilah. Following the ranting, Kanu had informed former Odemwingie that he would still choose family over everything else. In a later chat between the Russian born Osaze and Kanu, the former Inter Milan striker had demanded a public apology from the ex-Stoke City forward. And in an Instagram post on Wednesday, Odemwingie said that seemed to be a lovely and humble person when he met her during a charity match for Kanu heart foundation. He said his earlier vituperation was out of anger for people copying American lifestyle. “Picture two shows where my relationship with my big bro @kingkanu4 was just few months ago. I was misunderstood, acted out of anger or reading too much into the greetings. “I MET @amarakanu once at Watford stadium during the charity match for Kanu heart foundation and she seemed to be a lovely and humble person. “Apologies again for any offence. Had nothing to do with the Kanu family but rather the influence of American culture on our youths.”

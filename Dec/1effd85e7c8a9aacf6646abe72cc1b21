Former Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Chelsea to beat Everton at Goodison Park in tonight’s Premier League fixture. Owen also backed Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City to beat Man United at Old Trafford on Saturday evening. Providing his predictions, Owen told BetVictor: “With Manchester United so inconsistent, it’s very hard to get a handle on what to expect every time they play. For City it’s been a lot steadier, having hit form after a shaky start. It’s likely they’ll have most of the possession here, which interestingly could suit United. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side are far more suited to playing on the counter but with City in a far better place just now, I think this will end with a win for the blue half of Manchester.” Commenting on the Everton vs Chelsea match, Owen said, “One shining light has been the emergence of Dominic Calvert-Lewin. He’s continued his goal-scoring form, so Everton will still carry a big threat in front of goal. “That said, with Chelsea in such good form, I can’t see anything other than an away win.” The kick-off time for Man United vs Man City is 6:30 pm, while that of Everton vs Chelsea is 9 pm.

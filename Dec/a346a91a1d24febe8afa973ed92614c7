The Southwest Security Network (Amotekun) in Oyo State, has stated that its operatives did not kill a student of the University of Ibadan (UI) last Sunday. Retired Col. Olayinka Olayanju, the Commandant, in a press release on Saturday, said the corps only engaged a three-man robbery gang. Olayanju noted that the leader was eliminated, while two others were handed over to the Police at Atiba Station in Oyo town. He recalled that on Sunday, December 20, an Amotekun patrol team from Oyo East and Atiba Local Government Areas ran into an illegal road block around Sabo area in Oyo town at about 4 a.m. “While the team was attempting to clear the barricade to facilitate smooth passage for interstate commercial vehicles plying the road, a group of armed men suspected to be robbers fired at the Amotekun operatives and a gun duel ensued. “In the process, one of the robbers, nicknamed Akin Sarz, was neutralised and two other gang members were arrested at the scene with a locally made pistol and cartridges.” Olayanju said the corpse of Akin Sarz was similarly released to the police. He added that the surviving gang members are with the State CID Iyangaku, Ibadan. The commandant advised the public to get further details on the incident from Akinmorin Community in Afijio Local Government Area or the Police.

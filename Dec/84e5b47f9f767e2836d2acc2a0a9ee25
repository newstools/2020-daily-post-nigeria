Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has refused to be dragged into the Lionel Messi vs Cristiano Ronaldo debate. Koeman, speaking ahead of their home tie against Juventus in the Champions League, said he was looking forward to seeing two “incredible” talents on the pitch. Both sides clash in the final group stage fixture on Tuesday, bringing together the two eternal rivals. Ronaldo had missed out on the first leg after testing positive for COVID-19. Messi scored in that game as Barca won 2-0. “It’s fantastic that these two players have been so long at this top-level in the world. “They are the best players, in my opinion, in the last 10-15 years. Being successful all this time is incredible. It’s a great compliment to those players. “They are different, but they have incredible stats about scoring goals and hat-tricks about winning prizes. “It’s not nice to say who is better because both are incredible, I admire both players because they gave us so many nice evenings with great goals, with great titles. Let’s hope we can enjoy them tomorrow night,” Koeman said.

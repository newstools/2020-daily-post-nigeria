Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said his Manchester United counterpart, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer does not need his support, as pressure builds on him ahead of Saturday’s derby. United go into the game one place and one point above City. However, Solskjaer is under intense scrutiny, after the Red Devils were eliminated from the Champions League this week and dropped down into the Europa League. Their exit saw Solskjaer becoming the bookmakers’ favourite to be the next Premier League manager to lose his job. A negative result against Guardiola’s men will only increase the heat on the 47-year-old. But Guardiola does not think Solskjaer requires his sympathy. He told Sky Sports: “That’s why we get a lot of salary! “Important is to know the value of Solskjaer is there – no doubt about this. I don’t have to give him support because he is strong enough. “He knows how it works, this job; when we win, we are a genius and when we lose, we have to be sacked. It happens in United and all the clubs around the world. This is the reality.”

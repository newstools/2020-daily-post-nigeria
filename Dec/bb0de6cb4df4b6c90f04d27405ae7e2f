Former President Obasanjo has said that no Nigerian should go to sleep hungry considering the enormous resources the nation is blessed with. Obasanjo said this while addressing newsmen in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, on Tuesday. The former President was of the opinion that Nigerian leaders, not God, should be blamed for the situation of things in the country. While praying that the year 2021 be better than 2020, the Balogun Owu asserted that Nigeria was not supposed to be poor. “We do not have to blame God for our situation, we have to blame ourselves. Nigeria does not have to be poor. No Nigerian must go to bed hungry. That we have a situation like that is a choice by our leaders and followers alike, my prayer is that God will make the year 2021 a better year for all of us. But it will not happen without work,” he stated. Speaking about the outgoing year, the Nigerian leader asked the people to be thankful to God in all things, 2020 was a year of challenge. “We have gone from one form of insecurity to a bad economy and on top of it is the COVID-19. Some people, either for insecurity or for bad economy or for COVID-19 have gone to the great beyond. “But what then do we do, the rest of us? As I said, we should thank God. I believe we need to work hard in this country as we pray hard so that the coming year 2021 will be a glorious year for us. On what to do to fix the economy, Obasanjo said, “we are not doing the right thing now, when we do the right thing, the economy will be what it should be.”

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) are bitter over the sterling performance of its governors. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said APC was envious of PDP governors because their performance has endeared Nigerians to the party. Ologbondiyan said APC whose structures have collapsed, has been discomfited by the stability and unanimity within the PDP platform as well as the resilience of its leaders, despite the attempts to plant seeds of discord in their fold. A statement by Ologbondiyan said: “Nigerians can see the frustration in the APC leadership, which has now resorted to a vicious smear campaign and media attacks on our governors and leaders, having failed in all their sneaky plots to lure them to look the way of the defunct APC. “It is therefore not strange to us that the Secretary of APC’s illegal national caretaker committee, Senator James Akpanudoedehe, has been detailed, as new APC spokesperson, to commence a coordinated attack on our governors. “We are aware that this is part of the desperate bid to distract and drag down our performing governors to the level of their APC counterparts, who have become a collective symbol of failure in our contemporary political history. “It is laughable that the APC caretaker secretary is challenging the Rivers State Governor, Chief Nyesom Wike, to name APC leaders attempting to lure our governors, whereas he, Akpanudoedehe, is aware of how the APC leadership, to which he belongs, have been going around our governors and leaders genuflecting for audience, only to receive mere photo opportunities.”

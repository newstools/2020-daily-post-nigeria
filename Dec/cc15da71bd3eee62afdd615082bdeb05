The Chief Judge of Lagos and Chairman, Judicial Service Commission, Hon. Justice Kazeem Alogba, has sworn-in 17 newly appointed Magistrates in the state. The Lagos State government disclosed this in a statement released via its official Twitter account on Sunday. Alogba urged the new Magistrates to be courageous and limit their social circles in order to successfully carry out the task given to them by God and Man. He said the appointments were in recognition of their impressive track records and urged them to see the Oath of Office and Oath of Secrecy as a guide in carrying out their official responsibilities, while not losing cognisance of their reputations and the respect of their families who look up to them. “In the course of discharging your duties, you will be approached by families, relatives and friends who will want to seek one favour or the other from you. But you have to be mindful that you are to be just in what you do, no matter whose ox is gored. “I will advise you not to shun or disrespect them but apply the fear of God and wisdom in your dealings with them. “The Oath of Office and Oath of Secrecy should guide you in your doings. Always be calm, calculative and courageous in your endeavours. “You have been saddled with an onerous task and the opportunity to define your legacy while the whole world looks up to you to be fair, impartial and just in adjudicating cases. Don’t let them down,” he said.

Summer signing, Kai Havertz, has been tipped to become a special player at Chelsea. Arsenal legend, Paul Merson believes the player will become great in London despite the slow start he has made to his Premier League career. The Germany international Havertz was brought in for £72m, but is yet to fully settle and nail down a place in his manager’s new-look side. Merson is adamant the 21-year-old former Leverkusen star will come good. Merson believes Havertz’s early difficulties mirror the problems former Chelsea star Michael Ballack experienced during his early Stamford Bridge career. “Not yet I wouldn’t (panic) yet,” Merson told Sky Sports. “When he was playing where he was when he was at Leverkusen everything went through him he was the star man. “He’s not the star man here so he’s not touching the ball as many times as what he would when he was playing for his club team in Germany. “I’d give him time I think he’s a special player. I think he’s got to get used to it. “But I’d definitely be patient with him I think this lad will turn out to be a special footballer, he’s only young and it’s hard for him. He’s come into a team and they are flying and he just hasn’t got going yet.” Lampard brought in the German mainly because of the player’s versatility which he showed at Bayer Leverkusen. Chelsea have so far used him as an attacking midfielder, central midfield and on the right wing. He was used at right wing at Goodison Park on Saturday evening and he didn’t exactly have much success there in his 68 minutes on the pitch as the Blues fell 1-0 to Everton.

Jigawa State COVID-19 taskforce committee says twenty-nine new cases have been identified in the state out of which twenty-six are corps members. Chairman of the taskforce and Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health Dr. Salisu Mu’azu disclosed this after a stakeholders’ meeting in Dutse. He explained that fourteen corps members tested positive in the batch B stream I NYSC orientation camp, out of which eight are currently admitted while the remaining six have recovered and discharged. “No fewer than eight COVID-19 patients are currently on admission at one of the isolation centres” he noted. He added that another 15 out of 150 batch ‘B’ stream 2, NYSC corps members posted to Jigawa also tested positive for COVID-19. The Permanent Secretary said the discoveries were made after all corps members were subjected to the compulsory test on entry into the camp. He said there is every likelihood that more cases will be recorded as the NYSC members continue to arrive at the camp. The taskforce committee chairman, however, said the state government has ordered the immediate reopening of three state isolation centres after its closure in September due to zero cases recorded.

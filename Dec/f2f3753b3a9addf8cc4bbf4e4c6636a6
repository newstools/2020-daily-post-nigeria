Sani Yerima, former Governor of Zamfara State, has declared his intention to contest for president in 2023. Yerima made his intention known at a press conference in Abuja, where he stated that the time was right after he buried his ambition severally in the past. He also dismissed claims of zoning in the All Progressives Congress, APC. He said: “You may recall that in 2006, I declared my interest to contest for presidency after having served Zamfara State for a period of eight years. “However, I decided to withdraw for the current President at that time and since then I went to Senate for three terms. Now that Mr. President is completing his second term, I decided to try again to see what God will have for me having voluntarily decided not to go to the Senate again.” On the issue of zoning, Yerima said: “You see, I don’t think there is anything like agreement. You can ask Mr President, he led the group, Asiwaju was there, I was part of it, there was no meeting. Agreement can’t be verbal, it has to be written.”

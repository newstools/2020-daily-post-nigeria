The National Universities Commission (NUC) has ordered Vice-Chancellors of universities to stop academic activities amid increasing COVID-19 cases. Chris Maiyaki, Deputy Executive Secretary (Administration) signed the circular. Classrooms, hostel accommodation, conferences and seminars are to be put on hold. Maiyaki directed the universities to remain closed and await further instructions. “Vice-Chancellors are to please note that the directive is part of the measures approved by Mr. President to mitigate the second wave of Coronavirus infections in the country. “The affected officers are expected to perform their duties from home while those on GL 13 and above should strictly adhere to the extant preventive measures”, he said. On December 22, the federal government ordered civil servants on GL 12 and below to stay at home for five weeks.

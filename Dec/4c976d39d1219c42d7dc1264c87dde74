UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday reacted to the abduction of students by suspected bandits at Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State. Guterres’ statement by UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Monday in New York called for “immediate and unconditional” release of no fewer than 300 male students abducted from Government Science secondary school. “The secretary-general strongly condemns the Dec. 11 attack on a secondary school in Katsina State, Nigeria and the reported abduction of hundreds of boys by suspected armed bandits. The secretary-general warned that attacks on schools and other educational facilities constitute a grave violation of human rights. The UN chief urged security agencies to arrest and bring those responsible for the heinous act to justice. He reaffirmed the “solidarity and support” of the organisation to the Federal Government and Nigerians in their fight “against terror, violent extremism and organised crime”.

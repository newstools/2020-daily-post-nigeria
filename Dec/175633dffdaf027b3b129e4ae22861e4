The new Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy, Festus Daudu, says Nigeria has the potential to compete with Russian, United Kingdom, United States and others in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). On Thursday, Daudu noted that Africa’s most populous country was blessed with enormous human resources. The official said this during the handover ceremony between him and the former Permanent Secretary, Musa Istifanus, at the Ministry’s headquarters in Abuja. Daudu said the renaming of the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy was in line with global development. “Nigeria cannot be left behind in ICT. The world is moving forward, we need to move with the globe”, Daudu stressed. The Permanent Secretary appealed for maximum cooperation from the management and staff. “You need a collection of trees to produce a forest. I believe that all of you seated here are a collection of diverse human resources required to make the Ministry achieve its mandate”. Istifanus thanked everyone for their support in the implementation of policies and programmes while he was in office.

Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has explained why he benched Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford for the Red Devils’ Premier League clash with West Ham United on Saturday evening. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Solskjaer dropped Fernandes and Rashford from his starting XI against West Ham. Explaining his decision not to start Fernandes and Rashford, Solskjaer was quoted by Metro UK as saying: “With Marcus and Bruno, they are two important players for us. “They have been kicked between pillar and post lately. “Bruno’s foot has been sore since the Southampton game. The decision was easy to keep him out, hopefully, I don’t have to use him tonight. “Rashford is fit enough to be on the bench. He said he’s ready if needed.” He added, “It’s a strong team, we have selection headaches every time. Of course, they [the other players] get a chance to prove their worth and show what they can do.”

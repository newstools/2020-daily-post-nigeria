Manchester is set to complete its first January signing after agreeing on a deal for Moises Caicedo, according to Diario Extra. Caicedo, 19, has attracted interest from RB Leipzig and AC Milan, but United seem to have won the race for his signature. The Red Devils have negotiated a fee of around £4.5million plus add-ons. Caicedo impressed during his four appearances in World Cup qualifiers for Ecuador and scored his first goal in a 4-2 victory over Uruguay in October. The midfielder currently plays his football with Independiente del Valle, but the club became resigned to losing him earlier this month. “We have received an offer from a European club for Moises Caicedo, we are negotiating the proposal,” said the club’s manager Santiago Morales. “It is most likely that he will not be in our team in 2021 due to the proposal we’ve received, it is very difficult to keep him.”

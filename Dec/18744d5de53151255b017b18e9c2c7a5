Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has named Arsenal’s Bukayo Saka as his ‘man of the match’ following the Gunners’ 3-1 victory over Chelsea in the Premier League on Boxing Day. Arsenal defeated Chelsea at Emirates Stadium on Saturday, following goals from Alexandre Lacazette, Granit Xhaka and Bukayo Saka. Mikel Arteta’s men claimed all three points as Tammy Abraham’s late strike was not enough to give Frank Lampard’s side a point. Asked to pick his man of the match, Neville told Sky Sports: “One hundred per cent him [Saka for man of the match]. “Absolutely loved his performance. He scored a goal at the beginning of the second half. “[He has been] absolutely outstanding, playing off that right-hand side.” Neville added: “Arsenal have played well as a team. All of them have done really well today.” Saka will now hope to continue his impressive display for Arsenal when they tackle Brighton in an away Premier League fixture on Tuesday night.

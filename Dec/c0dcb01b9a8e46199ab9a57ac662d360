Ali Ndume, Senator representing Borno South, has commended the Nigeria Police Force, NPF, for apprehending and extraditing Abdulrasheed Maina, former chairman of the Pension Reform Task Force Team. Ndume said the arrest and extradition of Maina was an indication that the force was not a write-off. Addressing journalists in Abuja, the lawmaker vowed to withdraw his surety status for Maina. “I commend the Nigeria Police Force for executing the bench warrant issued on Maina by the Federal High Court in Abuja. “This has shown that the NPF is not a write-off. They are professionals under the able leadership of the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. “With the successful arrest, extradition and subsequent remand of Maina at the Kuje Correctional Centre, I will proceed to direct my legal team to begin the process of withdrawing my suretiship for Maina with immediate effect because his action has shown that he is not trustworthy,” he said. Maina, who is standing trial for corruption before Justice Okon Abang of a Federal High Court in Abuja, had jumped bail and fled to Niger Republic. The ex-Pension boss was however arrested by INTERPOL and extradited back to Nigeria. Upon his return, the trial judge had ordered his demand in Kuje Correctional Centre.

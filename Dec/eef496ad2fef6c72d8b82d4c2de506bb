Shkodran Mustafi’s agent, Emre Ozturk, seems to have confirmed that talks have taken place with Barcelona over a possible move for the player in the January transfer window. The 28-year-old defender is yet to start a Premier League fixture under Mikel Arteta and looks set for the exit door, with his contract due to expire at the end of the campaign. It is understood Mustafi turned down the Gunners’ offer of a new deal in the summer and there has been mounting speculation that the German could be set for a switch to the Camp Nou. Barca manager, Ronald Koeman, is seeking defensive reinforcements. Rapid Vienna’s Yusuf Demir, 17, has also been heavily linked with Barca and Ozturk fuelled rumours of a move by uploading a picture from Barcelona with the caption ‘ready for meeting’. While it was widely assumed Ozturk had travelled to Catalonia to discuss Demir’s future, he has since revealed the real reason for his visit. “I’m not in Barcelona because of Yusuf Demir, but because of Shkodran Mustafi from Arsenal, who we also represent,” he told SPOX.

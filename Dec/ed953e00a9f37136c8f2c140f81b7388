Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said he is not contemplating the possibility of dropping into the Europa League. Los Blancos take on Borussia Monchengladbach, with the chance of them failing to qualify for the Champions League round of 16. A 2-0 defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk last week, saw Zidane’s men slump to third place in Group B. Madrid’s defeat was their second in the competition this season and they have never lost three times in a single group stage. Gladbach will go into the final round of fixtures sitting top of the group. “It is a different game because we know the situation,” Zidane told the media. “We want to add the three points and finish the round on top [of the group]. We have all that in mind. All the games are important, but it is a good opportunity to show what we are as a team.” Asked if he feared for his job if they failed to make it through, he replied: “The club will do what it has to do, as always. I only think about Wednesday’s game.”

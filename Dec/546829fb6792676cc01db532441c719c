Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has signed into law the 2021 Appropriation Bill of N147.53 billion passed by the State House of Assembly. The budget consists of N90.19 billion as recurrent and N57.34 billion as capital expenditures. Lalong while signing the bill, said the 2021 budget will focus on areas that will stimulate economic growth and recovery, particularly as the year begins under a second wave of COVID-19 which has affected the economy adversely. He said, “With the successful passage of the 2021 budget within record time, we shall now settle down to implement the budget vigorously. “As we face the second wave of COVID-19, we shall continue to appeal to our people to observe all protocols so that we do not have any reason to lock down again and further hurt the economy”. The Governor maintained that Government will in the 2021 fiscal year support businesses that will hopefully grow and in turn pay taxes especially now that the State has signed into law the new tax law for development.

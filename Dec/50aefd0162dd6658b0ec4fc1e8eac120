Maina was apprehended through the joint efforts of the Nigeria Police Force, INTERPOL National Central Bureau, Abuja and their Nigerien counterparts. He is currently in a detention facility in Niger Republic awaiting the completion of the extradition processes. The Nigeria Police Force spokesman, DCP Frank Mba, in a statement on Tuesday, said Maina would soon be brought back to the country to continue with his ongoing trial. “Following the arrest of former chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team, Abdulrashid Abdullahi Maina in Niamey, Niger Republic, the Nigeria Police Force is perfecting extradition processes of the fugitive to Nigeria to enable him face trial in pending criminal proceedings against him. “Maina, who was declared wanted by a court of competent jurisdiction, was arrested on 30th November 2020 through the collaborative efforts of the operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, INTERPOL NCB, Abuja and their Nigerien counterparts,” Mba said.

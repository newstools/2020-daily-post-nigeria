A businesswoman, Iyabo Donald, on Tuesday approached a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan to dissolve her six-year-old marriage to estranged husband, Richard Iyabo told the court that she had lived in great fear for the past six years of marriage because her husband treats her like a common criminal. “My lord, Richard tracks me around the house with his gun and even locks me out at the midnight with our two children. “Worst still, he is such an irresponsible man because he neither caters for the children nor I,” Iyabo said in her statement before Chief Ademola Odunade, the court’s President. Iyabo’s mother corroborated her daughter’s statement, adding that Richard could kill her daughter if the court failed to act now. However, Richard, a mobile police officer, objected to the suit and prayed the court to help keep his marriage because he still needs her. He admitted guilt but promised to make amends. In the ruling, Odunade pronounced the marriage dissolved in the interest of peace. He awarded custody of the two children from the union to the petitioner, and directed the respondent to pay N10,000 as their monthly feeding allowance, including being responsible for their education and welfare, NAN reports.

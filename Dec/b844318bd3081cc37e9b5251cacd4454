Barcelona forward, Antoine Griezmann, has blamed himself and his teammates for their Champions League 3-0 defeat against Barcelona on Tuesday night. Griezmann said Barcelona players lacked attitude, and desire to run and to defend against Juventus. A brace from Ronaldo and a strike from Weston McKennie ensured Juventus defeated Barcelona at Camp Nou. “We didn’t turn up,” Griezmann said as quoted by ESPN after the game. “They turned us over in the first half. We were lacking in every department: attitude, desire to run, to defend … everything was bad. “Who’s to blame if not those of us who are out there playing? We know how to run, how to work hard, and that’s what we must do to move forward. “I don’t want to look for excuses. We have to leave that to one side and work hard. There’s nothing else for it. There’s a game on Sunday [against Levante], and we have to win it. The image [of the team] tonight was ugly.”

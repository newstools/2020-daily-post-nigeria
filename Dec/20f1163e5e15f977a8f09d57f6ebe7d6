Camp Nou king, Lionel Messi snubbed his eternal rival, Cristiano Ronaldo in The Best FIFA Men’s Player voting. He also voted Robert Lewandowski, eventual winner of the award, as his third choice. Lewandowski won the award in Zurich on Thursday after earning the highest vote from fans, journalists, national team coaches and captains for his outstanding 2019-20 season at Bayern Munich. Lewandowski netted 55 goals in 47 appearances across all competitions last term, helping Bayern win the Bundesliga, DFB Cup and Champions League treble. The Polish striker beat off competition from Messi and Ronaldo in the final three-man shortlist. Juventus talisman Ronaldo, voted for Lewandowski, Messi and Kylian Mbappe in his final three, but was surprisingly not among Messi’s final choices. Messi on his part picked Neymar to win the accolade and put Mbappe in at second before giving a nod to Lewandowski. The Argentine’s decision to include two PSG stars is likely to raise a few eyebrows though, given the fact he has been heavily linked with a move to Parc des Princes next year.

Mr Rotimi Abiru, a member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, has told INEC to improve on the voter registration exercise conducted in the nation.. Abiru, representing Shomolu Constituency 2, made this known in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) after he had voted at Gbagada Ward, G PU030 during Saturday’s by-elections. The Assembly man advised the commission to conduct voter registration every year instead of the four years exercise to allow citizens that had attained voting age to vote. He said since the law permitted citizens that had attained 18 years to vote, they would be disenfranchised if the exercise was conducted only every four years. “For INEC to be updating voter registration every three or four years is quite unfortunate because voters attain 18 years every year. “This means that people that have attained voting age should have the right to register without disfranchising them,” he added. Abiru stressed that there were different applications that could be employed through the help of bank verification number (BVN) to update citizens that had attained 18 years.

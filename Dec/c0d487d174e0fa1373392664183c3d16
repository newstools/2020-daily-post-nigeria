The Federal Government has reacted to claims in some quarters that the abduction of students from Government Science Secondary school in Kankara, Katsina State, and their release was stage-managed. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, dismissed the claim on Saturday when he featured on a special edition of the Nigeria Television Authority programme, “Good Morning Nigeria’’ Lai Mohammed described the claim as ‘senseless.’ “It does not make sense for any administration to stage-manage abduction of students or any of its citizens. “What precisely does the government want to achieve? Is it to prove the deficiency of the military or what. “In the case of Dapchi, we had all kinds of bizarre theories. “You have to be in government to know how many sleepless nights the president, ministers and head of security outfits spent until the matter is resolved,’’ the Minister added. Recall thag the schoolboys abducted from their school on Dec. 11 in Kankara were rescued on Friday and paid the President a visit in Katsina State.

Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has insisted that midfielder, Thomas Partey, is putting a lot of pressure in the Gunners’ squad. Arteta said this while providing the latest injury update on Partey ahead of his side’s Premier League derby clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. The Spaniard explained that Partey would train with his Arsenal team-mates tomorrow as he bids to prove his fitness ahead of the Tottenham clash. Partey has not featured for Arsenal since he sustained an injury in their 3-0 defeat to Aston Villa last month. The Ghanaian international also missed Arsenal’s Europa League 4-1 victory over Rapid Vienna on Thursday night. Asked to provide an update on Partey’s fitness after Arsenal defeated Rapid, Arteta told reporters at his post-match press conference that “He is putting a lot of pressure on us. “He’s training tomorrow with us and let’s see how it goes in the next couple of days.”

A former Manchester United defender, Wes Brown, has backed midfielder, Paul Pogba, to leave the club following the latest twist in his situation at Old Trafford. Pogba has been in the headlines this week after his agent, Mino Raiola, claimed that the player is “unhappy” and his time at Man United is “over”. The France World Cup winner has made eight Premier League appearances for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this season, scoring one goal. Speaking on the development, Brown told talkSPORT that it would be best for Pogba to move on. “It is a tough one, isn’t it? What a time to actually bring that out. “That should all be done behind closed doors, but obviously it has been done a few times. “You’ve to ignore it, but at the same time, it’s there. It doesn’t do any favours for Paul [Pogba] because we all know how good Paul can be. “But in general, he is saying he wants to leave. It does not help the team in any way before a big game.” Brown added: “There have always been really big players at Man United, and if it is not worked out they move on. “We all know Paul is a class player, but if it is not working out, then it is not working out. “At the end of the day, it’s what it’s. It is not like it’s the first time it’s happened, it’s happened before. I suppose you move on from it.”

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has claimed Harry Kane is an injury concern ahead of Sunday’s North London derby against Arsenal, after sitting out training on Wednesday. Kane, Sergio Reguilon, Carlos Vinicius and Erik Lamela were all not pictured in training ahead of the teams’ Europa League clash at Linz ASK on Thursday. When asked about their absence, Mourinho confirmed in his pre-match press conference that the four players are injured. “I don’t believe he [Lamela] has a chance for the weekend,” Mourinho said. “Harry, Vinicius and Sergio there is a chance for them to be [fit] for the weekend.” Mourinho then refused to reveal the nature of Kane’s injury, but said there was a “good chance” his captain would return to face Arsenal.

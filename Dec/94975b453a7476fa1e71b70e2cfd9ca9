Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has revealed that he told Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, that “the best team lost”, following his side’s Premier League 2-1 defeat against the Reds. Liverpool defeated Tottenham at Anfield, thanks to two goals from Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino. Heung-Min Son did score a goal for Mourinho’s side. “I told him the best team lost, and he disagreed, but that’s his opinion,” Mourinho told Amazon Prime Video when asked what he told Klopp after the game. Mourinho added, “By the way, if I behave the same way on the touchline like he does, I’ve no chance to stay there, and I’m out for a minute.” “Overall, the game was always under control, and I am very pleased with the performance.” Tottenham are now in the second position on the Premier League table with three points behind leaders Liverpool after 13 matches.

Speaking with Diario AS, Suarez said “They [Barca players] make the worst individual and team mistakes.” According to him, the players lacked sharpness, aggressiveness, quality”…and “just disappeared” on the field. “They must prove themselves irrespective of the coach,” he added “Besides, no one helps Messi on the pitch,” he noted.

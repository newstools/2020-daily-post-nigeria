The leader of Awaiting The Second Coming of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has urged believers of Christ to start putting their houses in order because the coming of Christ, Jesus is at hand. Giwa, while addressing his members in Akure, said there was no time left for sinners than to accept Jesus Christ. He admonished true believers to remain resolute and expect great tribulation any moment. “Matthew 24:13 says he who endures forever shall be saved. I urge the believers of Christ to start putting their houses in order for the coming of Christ, Jesus. “The events that are currently happening in the world should inform our decisions to start preparing for the coming of Christ. “The great tribulation is on the way and it will take place any moment. Let me remind the sinners to repent and give their lives to Jesus, the finisher of our faith,” Giwa stated.

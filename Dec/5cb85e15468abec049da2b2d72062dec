One Mr. Tunde Sowemimo has told an Ogun State Magistrate Court sitting in Isabo Abeokuta that he was led by the devil to steal an Android phone belonging to one Mr. Toriola Olayinka. Sowemimo, who described himself as a disc seller in Odo-Oyo area of Abeokuta, was said to have committed the offence on Friday within the Ogun State capital. The police said he stole the Tecno Spark 2 phone from Olayinka’s pocket, adding that he was later arrested. Appearing before the court on Wednesday in charge number, MAC/608C/2020, Sowemimo pleaded guilty to the charge of theft against him. Asked by the Magistrate, O. M. Somefun, the accused person explained that he was in love with the phone, saying “it was the devil that pushed me to steal the handset, because I love it. Please forgive me, I won’t do that again.” But, Somefun disagreed with the defendant as she warned him against blaming the devil for his own crime. The Magistrate lambasted Sowemimo, saying he should be celebrating the Christmas in prison. However, respite came for Sowemimo when the complainant asked for the withdrawal of the case. “I want to withdraw this case because the defendant’s family members have been begging me and my mother has also pleaded with me to let go. I was not forced to withdraw the case. I want the court to pardon the defendant,” Olayinka told the Magistrate. In her ruling, Somefun struck out the case, with a strong warning to the defendant never to return to his old ways.

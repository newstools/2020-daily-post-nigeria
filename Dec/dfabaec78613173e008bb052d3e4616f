Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, has assured that the government was doing its best to forestall attacks by bandits. His comment was in reaction to the incidents at Maitumbi and Kuchi communities in Bosso and Munya Local Government Areas. No fewer than 20 people were allegedly abducted by dozens of assailants, and scores wounded. In a statement on Monday by his spokesperson, Mary Noel-Berje, Bello urged the people to support authoritiesâ€™ efforts against the criminals. He told them to give security agencies information that would help arrest the perpetrators. Bello added that the recent meeting of the North Central State Governors in Makurdi provided ideas to curtail banditry. The governor condoled with families of the deceased. He directed the State Emergency Management Agency to attend to those taking refuge at the Maitumbi Primary School.

The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Adamawa State has inaugurated a new caretaker management committee. The committee comprises 57 members who are to serve in an interim capacity for the next six months. The new committee consists of 36 at the state level and 21 as chairmen of the party at the 21 local government areas of the state. The new EXCO is headed by Alhaji Ibrahim Bilal as state chairman, Wafarniyi Theman as Secretary and Mohammed Abdullahi as Public Relations Officer (PRO). The three held the same offices in the previous EXCO. The new committee is mandated to conduct registration of new and old members, as well as to ensure reconciliation among aggrieved members.

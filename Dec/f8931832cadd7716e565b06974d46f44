Former Arsenal player, Perry Groves, has said Mikel Arteta will be sacked as the manager of the club, if he doesn’t get good results in the next three games. Arteta has only been at the Emirates for one year, but is facing increasing scrutiny following a poor run of results. In just 14 Premier League games the Spaniard has overseen eight defeats, including four in a row at the Emirates. Technical director Edu has given Arteta a vote of confidence, but Groves believes more losses could change the situation. He told talkSPORT: “If these lacklustre performances continue over the next three games, are Arsenal fans telling me they’d stick with Arteta? “I think he’s got three games – we play Man City [in the EFL Cup quarter-final on Tuesday night], Chelsea on Boxing Day and then Brighton away. “I’ve always said a manager should have three transfer windows to get the players in and get the players out, and one full season – that’s when you judge him. “But if things are that dire, that bad, you can’t go a full season.”

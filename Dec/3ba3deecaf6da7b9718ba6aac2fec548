The Federal Controller of Works for Lagos State, Olukayode Popoola, has announced a 72-hour total closure of the Third Mainland Bridge, in order to cast concrete on the expansion joints. Popoola on Tuesday told NAN that the shutdown will take effect from midnight on Saturday to midnight on Tuesday. According to him, the construction works had reached the stage for casting concrete on additional three expansion joints. Last week, Popoola said “On the Island-bound lane where we are working now, the contractor is ready to cast another three expansion joints this weekend, but because of the festive period we have a lot of vehicles on the road. “We were advised to leave it until next week, maybe during the public holiday where we will do the total closure.” He noted that the work on the surface of the bridge was over 70 per cent done, but the entire project was 22 per cent completed.

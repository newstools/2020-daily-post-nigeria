Operatives of the Rapid Response Squad of the Nigeria Police have foiled robbery attempt in a gridlock in Lagos, NAN reports. The command’s Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, who made this known in a statement on a Sunday, said that two suspects were arrested. Adejobi stated that the incident occurred around Otedola Bridge on Lagos-Ibadan expressway. According to him, the police team led by the squad’s commander, CSP Yinka Egbeyemi, on Friday ran into the suspected armed robbers around 11:00 p.m. at Otedola Bridge inward Ojota. “The robbers abandoned their motorcycle marked NND 268 WZ, a toy gun and some dangerous weapons,” he said.
Adejobi further revealed that the suspects were later traced and arrested at their hideout in Agege. “The raid of hideouts and dangerous areas in the state, particularly in Agege and its environs, is part of the proactive strategies to minimise crime in Lagos State. “Some of the areas raided include Isokoko, Oke-Koto, Abattoir, Dopemu, Elere, Oniwaya and Pen Cinema, all in Agege,” he added.

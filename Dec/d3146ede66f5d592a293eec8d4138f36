The Zamfara State High Court on Tuesday adjourned the case filed by the dethroned Emir of Maru, Alhaji Abubakar Ibrahim, against the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Muhammad Adamu Abubakar, and five others, to December 16. NAN reports that the former Emir dragged Adamu and five others to court for illegal detention and defamation of character. Ibrahim was sacked by the Zamfara State Government in 2019 for allegedly aiding and abetting of banditry and was kept in the Zamfara Government House for eleven months. The other five respondents in the suit include the Secretary to Zamfara State Government, Alhaji Bala Maru, the state’s Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS), the Commissioner of Police, Assistant Director, DSS. The erstwhile Emir is also demanding N6.5 billion as damages for alleged infringement on his fundamental human rights. However, Justice Bello Shinkafi, the Presiding Judge, said the case was adjourned due to a number of pending cases before the court. Speaking to reporters at the court’s premises, Sam Anosuke, the Counsel to the dethroned Emir, said: “The matter was supposed to be ruled on today, but shifted to December 16. “The court is always overloaded, that’s why the case is taking time.” Anosuke, however, expressed the hope that his client would get justice at the end of the day.

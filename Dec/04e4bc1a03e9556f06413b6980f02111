Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has charged management of the Leadership Newspapers to keep the newspapers on the newstand to preserve the memory of its publisher, Sam Nda-Isaiah, who died on Friday. In a condolence message released to newsmen on Sunday by the governor’s Press Secretary, Humwashi Wonosikou, Fintiri said Sam Nda-Isaiah’s sterling qualities stood him out as a rare Nigerian who interpreted the Nigerian situation with great understanding and who demosntarted great passion for its development. “I express my condolences to the immediate family of Sam Nda-Isaiah, the Government and People of Niger State, the Leadership family and indeed the entire Nupe Kingdom over the painful loss,” Fintiri stated. He added that the Leadership publisher’s contributions to the new Nigeria will be greatly missed “at a time when quacks have taken over the cyber space peddling dangerous rumour and hate speeches.” Fintiri commended the use of his paper in building bridges of peace across divides and unity, and expressed the hope that the drive is sustained even after him. “Sam Nda-Isaiah’s hard work to ensure the oneness of Nigeria must not be allowed to die,” the governor said. “I convey our deepest condolences on behalf of my family and the good people of Adamawa State. His memory, commitment and contribution to Nigeria will never be forgotten,” Fintiri concluded.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has advised Gov. Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State to “move on” with his political aspirations and stop levelling baseless allegations on political leaders in the state. Recall that Umahi, who defected from PDP to the All Progressives Congress (APC), accused some PDP chieftains of sponsoring cultism and the outlawed Indigenous People of Biafra to destabilise and cause mayhem in Ebonyi. However, the Acting National Vice Chairman of South-East PDP, Chief Ali Odefa, during a news conference at the party’s zonal office in Enugu, advised Umahi to move on. According to him ”PDP has since moved on after his decamping from our great party to his new party. “We happily urge him to move on and focus on playing his politics in APC. “It is not possible for him to be in APC and run the affairs of PDP in Ebonyi. “We will deploy every legal arsenal available to protect the sovereignty of our party from meddlesome interlopers. “It is also important to draw the attention of the public to the fact that the false alarm raised by Umahi is totally baseless. “There is no political crisis in Ebonyi, there is no imminent election in the state. “In fact, there is no situation that warrants the kind of threat he issued in Ebonyi. “It is a common knowledge that Umahi and his family remain the major beneficiaries of the support of the PDP. “And each of these PDP leaders, whom he has suddenly branded promoters of cultism in Ebonyi, played prominent roles in making him a successful politician. “For the records, until he jumped ship to APC, the governor became everything he is in Ebonyi and Nigeria politics on PDP platform. “Let me also urge supporters and members of PDP in Ebonyi to remain calm and go about their normal businesses without fear,” he said.

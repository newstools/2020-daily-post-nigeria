The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has said President Muhammadu Buhari’s government was responsible for terrorist activities in Nigeria. HURIWA, a frontline Rights group, alleged that Buhari’s attempt to appease terrorism was responsible for the upsurge in the fortune of terrorism in the North. They made the claim in response to the abduction and subsequent release of students of the Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State. A statement by the right group’s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, said the rehabilitation and de-radicalization of Boko Haram terrorists was behind violence and kidnapping in the country. The statement reads partly: “HURIWA has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to blame himself for the spate of attacks of soft targets by series of terrorists all across the country including the upsurge in the abduction for ransom of school children of Katsina state by daredevil terrorists christened by current administration as armed bandits. “The frequent rehabilitation, reintegration and the so-called de-radicalization of arrested terrorists by the government is the reason for the spate of bloody violence and kidnapping. “The releases of detained Boko haram terrorists by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari over the years under the dubious guise that they are rehabilitated as repentant terrorists deserving reintegration even whilst over 2 million families displaced by these terrorists are scattered in the different dilapidated buildings and huts called internally displaced centres are neglected and denied justice for the killings of their breadwinner and loved ones, are the exact reasons for the widespread attacks by terrorists in the North of Nigeria.” The rights group also blamed some governors especially that of Katsina State Bello Massari for the growing social menace of armed abductions of school children, wanton sexual violations of girls and the rampant attacks of communities in Katsina State because the governor has been known to have publicly associated and communed with notorious terrorists also called armed bandits whom were allegedly settled by the Katsina State administration to lay down their weapons and cease fire which the terrorists never complied with.”

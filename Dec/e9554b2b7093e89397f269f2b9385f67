Prominent stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Enugu State, have commended the Mai Mala Buni-led National Caretaker Committee of the party for its choice of Dr. Ben Nwoye to pilot the affairs of the party in the State. The National Executive Committee, NEC, of the APC had earlier in the week dissolved all the State Working Committees of the Party across the 36 States of the Federation. In its stead, caretaker committees are to be set up for each of the States. Reacting to the development, the Enugu APC stakeholders said the choice of Nwoye as the caretaker committee chairman for the party in Enugu State was the best. Their position was contained in a statement signed by Comrade Adolphus Ude, the Chairman of the APC Contact and Mobilization Committee, Enugu State, the secretary, Hon. Everistus Asadu, the women coordinator of the committee, Mrs. Lolo Nwankwo, youth coordinator, Offor Chukwunonwe, as well as Ikechukwu Oloto, Tony Ibekwe and Chief Nnaemeka Agu. They declared that Nwoye had been so much committed to the progress of the party in the State and that the national leadership was right in allowing him to continue the good work. “We are pleased with the choice of Dr. Ben Nwoye to head the APC caretaker committee for Enugu State. There is no doubt that Nwoye has done so much to make our great party, the APC, a force to reckon with in Enugu State. “He has been driving the party with so much commitment and passion, despite distractions here and there by some destabilization agents. We are delighted that he has now been given the nod to continue the good work. “We the true members of the party are deeply impressed by this development and assure the national leadership that with Nwoye, the party is in safe hands. “Our call at this moment is that every genuine member of the APC in Enugu State should rally round Dr. Ben Nwoye to move the party forward. Enough of all these needless and unnecessary distractions,” they stated.

Barcelona king, Lionel Messi has named Atletico goalkeeper, Jan Oblak as one of the best in the game at the moment. Messi admitted he relishes the challenge of trying to beat the Slovenia international
who joined Los Rojiblancos from Benfica in 2014. Oblak has established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in recent years, and remains a key performer for Diego Simeone’s side. He has also kept nine clean sheets in his 13 top-flight matches this season. He has a save percentage of 88.1 per cent, ahead of Sevilla shot-stopper Yassine Bounou on 80 per cent. Oblak made four saves when Simeone’s men played Messi-led Barcelona and were defeated 1-0 in November, with the Argentine unable to score. “He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world at the moment, and it’s always good to fight against the best ones,” Messi told Bud Football. “It’s an extra motivation to be able to, or to try to, score a goal, with what it means and how hard it is, as he proves in every game he plays. “So, it’s nice to see him outside but also face him in the games. It makes them more exciting.” Barcelona face Eibar in their next league game on Tuesday, while Atletico Madrid with Oblak in goal, take on Getafe a day later.

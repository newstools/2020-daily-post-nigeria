Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has mocked the world football governing body, saying Hansi Flick’s only chance to collect The Best FIFA Men’s Coach award in future is if Bayern Munich find new competitions to win. In the year in review, Flick led Bayern to a Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League treble. The German club also lifted the UEFA Super Cup and DFL Super Cup in 2020. However, Liverpool’s Klopp retained the Best Coach prize ahead of Flick, during the FIFA’s annual awards ceremony on Thursday. Klopp led Liverpool to a first English top-flight title in 30 years last term, but admitted he was shocked to win it. Mourinho, whose Spurs side were lost 2-1 to Liverpool on Wednesday, was asked about the decision when previewing Spurs’ clash with Leicester City. He replied: “I think the only chance for Flick to win is that Bayern find two or three more new competitions to win it. “So maybe if he wins seven titles in one season maybe he wins the award, because I believe he only won the Champions League, Bundesliga, Pokal, European Super Cup, German Super Cup – he only won five and the biggest one of all. “So I think poor Flick the only chance is for Bayern to try and find two or three more trophies to see if he can win it.”

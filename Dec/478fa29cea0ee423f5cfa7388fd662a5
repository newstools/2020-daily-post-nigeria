Manchester United striker, Edinson Cavani, has been fined £100,000 and banned for three games over an Instagram post. Cavani was found guilty of breaking FA Rule E3 and must also complete face-to-face education after admitting a charge. The Uruguay striker will now miss United’s games against Aston Villa, Manchester City and Watford. The 33-year-old reposted an Instagram story, which featured a racially offensive term, following a 3-2 win at Southampton on November 29. The post was deleted and Cavani apologised. An FA statement said: “A comment posted on the Manchester United FC striker’s Instagram page was insulting, abusive, improper and brought the game into disrepute contrary to FA Rule E3.1. “The post also constitutes an “aggravated breach”, which is defined in FA Rule E3.2, as it included reference, whether express or implied, to colour and/or race and/or ethnic origin.”

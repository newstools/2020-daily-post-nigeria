Former Arsenal striker, Ian Wright, has predicted the Gunners to beat Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur 3-2 when both sides clash in the Premier League derby on Sunday. Arsenal head to the game after defeating Rapid Wien 4-1 in the Europa League on Thursday,
Tottenham played a 3-3 draw with LASK. Providing his prediction, Wright was quoted by Metro UK as saying, “You have to hope that the creativity from the midfield to the forwards gets better because at the moment from the forwards’ point of view it’s not happening. “I would say they are not creating enough chances for our main man to score so you would have to say with Spurs and their free-scoring vibe at the minute you have to fancy them as favourites, but I am still going to go with Arsenal to beat them 3-2.” The kick-off time for the match is 5:30 pm, Nigerian time.

The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has sympathised with a former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, over the death of his father, Alhaji Musa Saleh Kwankwaso. Saleh, who was the District Head of Madobi, died in the early hours of Friday. Tinubu in a statement on Monday described the late Saleh as “an excellent human being, a deeply religious man and the district head of his people in Madobi who provided them exemplary leadership”. He further said, “The passing of our parents can be painful indeed. No matter how old they may be, we never wanted them to leave. I have been through this and so I know how hurtful it is. “I also know how close you were to Baba and the remarkable influence he had on you. “We must, however, thank Almighty Allah that Baba lived to an advanced age, served his people, Nigeria and humanity meritoriously.”

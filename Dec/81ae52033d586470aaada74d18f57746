Speaking through his Chief Press Secretary, Nnogwu Sani Mohammed at the ongoing security and economic summit of the Northcentral Governors Forum in Makurdi, the Benue State capital, the Governor said he “is focused on delivering the mandate of rebuilding Kogi State.” According to Bello, ”his administration’s ability to curb insecurity in Kogi State and massive youth empowerment has been attracting support leading to the calls” for him to contest for presidency come 2023 but maintained that he does “not want to be distracted with” such calls. The Governor called on the people to give him the needed support to deliver his second term promises to the people of Kogi State.

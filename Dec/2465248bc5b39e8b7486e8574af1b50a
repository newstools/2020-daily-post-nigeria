The Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, has recovered from COVID-19 after testing negative for the virus. The Director of Press and Public Affairs to the governor, Dr Makut Macham, disclosed this on Thursday in a statement in Jos. DAILY POST recalls that Lalong had gone into isolation on December 17 after testing positive for the dreaded virus. The statement read, “One week after the governor tested positive to the virus, he is now free of the disease after his latest test result came out negative. “The governor’s negative status was communicated to him on Wednesday night. Lalong, who has been in isolation since December 17, appreciated God for the speedy recovery and thanked the people of the state, his friends and associates for praying for him. “Having contracted the virus and undergone treatment myself, I wish to reiterate that COVID-19 is not a death sentence as early detection helps to address it and reduce chances of death. “We should not stigmatise against anyone who tests positive or is suspected of having the disease. “Rather, such people should serve as motivation for others to voluntarily test to improve the safety of all,” the statement added.

Nollywood actress, Etinosa, has called out singer Queency Benna, accusing her of falsely claiming that a man identified as Alaska Obi, raped her. Etinosa said that the man only failed to pay Benna the full amount they agreed on before a private romantic rendezvous between them Etinosa noted that Obi did wrong by failing to fulfill his part of the bargain, insisting that “false accusation of rape ” is “unacceptable to revenge a man’s bad gesture.” In a post she shared on Instagram, the controversial actress added that the allegations might have been Benna’s only way of getting back at Obi. She, however, maintained that no matter what, making a “mockery of millions of real victims of rape fighting to be heard, believed and served justice,” wasn’t right. She added in the caption that “rape is not a joke.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-859965 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112452_Chrome-461x1024.jpg" alt="" width="461" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112452_Chrome-461x1024.jpg 461w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112452_Chrome-135x300.jpg 135w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112452_Chrome-691x1536.jpg 691w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screenshot_20201221-112452_Chrome.jpg 720w" sizes="(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px">

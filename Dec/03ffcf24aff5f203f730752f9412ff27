President Muhammadu Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has said his principal is yet to sack service chiefs, because he is satisfied with their performance. Shehu stated this while appearing on Arise TV on Monday night. He flayed the calls for service chiefs to be sacked, describing it as “out of place”. There have been fresh demand for Buhari to fire his service chiefs, following the beheading of at least 43 rice farmers at Zabarmari in the Jere Local Government Area of Borno State last Saturday. But Shehu insists the decision to sack or retain any of the service chiefs is entirely Buhari’s. “I am not aware that the tenure of service chiefs is subjected to any law of regulation that is clearly stated. They serve at the pleasure of the president and (if) the president is satisfied with their performance, he keeps them. The buck stops at his table — with due respect to the feelings of Nigerians. “The clamour for the sack is out of place considering that the president is not subject to opinion of the opposition political party which has clamoured for this all the time. It is entirely his own determination; he decides who he keeps as his service chiefs and for how long,” Shehu said.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has played down Jurgen Klopp’s claim that they are the favourites to win the Premier League this season. Klopp heaped praise on the Blues last week, saying they “look like favourites” as they have the “biggest squad and great players”. Lampard’s men sit in third place behind Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool on the table. He has now said that the Reds, Spurs, Manchester City and Manchester United are in the frame to win the title. “Liverpool and Manchester City seem to be pretty much everyone’s favourites and rightly so with the form they have had over the past three or four years and how they have built up their squads. “Even with injuries, you look at the squad Liverpool put out last night with players missing and it’s a very good side. Tottenham and Manchester United are in the frame too,” Lampard told Sky Sports.

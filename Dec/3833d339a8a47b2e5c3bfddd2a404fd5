Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has urged residents to respect the 12am to 4am curfew imposed by the Federal Government, as churches hold Crossover Services next week. Most churches will begin their services on Thursday, December 31 and end in the early hours of Friday, January 1. He said, “There are not meant to be any gathering. The curfew set by the NCDC (Nigeria Centre for Disease Control) and the PTF (Presidential Task Force on COVID-19) is still active. There is a national curfew from 12 midnight to 4am and that has to be respected. No night vigils in any form. “The instructions are there and all of the restrictions are in place as set by the PTF and the Lagos State Safety Commission. “So, there are no vigils anywhere. This is just one Christmas, we will have many Christmas. So, you can have your prayers at home.” Sanwo-Olu urged religious leaders to ensure their followers observe the protocols put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19, as Nigeria battles the second wave of the pandemic. The governor stated this on Thursday, while responding to questions from journalists at the State House in Marina, Lagos. Sanwo-Olu has now recovered from Coronavirus himself and says he experienced “moderate symptoms”.

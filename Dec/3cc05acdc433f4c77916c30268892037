Watford captain, Troy Deeney, has said Manchester United’s Edinson Cavani should get more than a three-game ban for his Instagram post. The Football Association has launched an investigation into Cavani’s post on social media following United’s 3-2 victory over Southampton on Sunday. The Uruguay striker responded to a post from a friend with ‘Gracias negrito’, which translates as, ‘Thanks, little black’. Cavani deleted the post after he was made aware that the word ‘negrito’ is interpreted differently in the UK, as opposed to his homeland where it is used as a term of endearment between friends. He is now facing a three-game ban if the FA decide to act. But when asked if he thinks a three-game suspension is enough for Cavani, Deeney told talkSPORT: “No, I don’t think it is. It’s a considered post. He’s written it out, thought about it, and he’s got people around him who would say, ‘I don’t think you should really do that.’ “I do think at times three games isn’t enough, because it’s got to be three games with a form of education in my opinion.”

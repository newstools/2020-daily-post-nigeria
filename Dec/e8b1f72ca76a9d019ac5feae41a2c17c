Some persons suspected to be the killers of a First-Class traditional ruler in Ondo State, the Olufon of Ifon, Oba Isreal Adeusi, the Olufon of Ifon, have been arrested. The suspects whose identities were still being concealed due to ongoing investigations were arrested by a combined team of security operatives in the state. Recall that Oba Adeusi was killed by gunmen at Elegbaka axis, along Benin/Owo highway while on his way from Akure, the State capital to his domain in Ifon, Ose Local Government area of the state. Disclosing the arrests of the suspects, the Commander of the Ondo Security Network Agency, otherwise known as Amotekun Corps, Adetunji Adeleye, stated that shortly after the incident, security operatives stormed Elegbaka forest where the suspects were apprehended. According to the Amotekun Commander, four kidnapped victims were rescued during the pursuit of the killers of late Oba Adeusi in the forest. While stating that the arrested suspects were undergoing interrogations, Adeleye dismissed the allegations that his men were nowhere to be found during the attack by the gunmen. The Amotekun boss further disclosed that in a bid to rid the state of banditry as well as kidnappings, the corps launched ‘Operation Clean Up’ which he said had led to the arrest of over 20 suspects from various black spots within the state. Adeleye explained that the move was designed to take the war to the criminals in their various hideouts in the city or the forest.

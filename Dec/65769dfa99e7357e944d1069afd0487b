Premier League teams will soon be allowed to name nine substitutes on the bench. However, the managers will only be able to make three changes per game and not five. Recently, there have been arguments for and against the reintroduction of substitutes each team can make amid a hectic schedule. Most top European leagues are still allowing five changes, with the Premier League the only major one to revert to the regular three of previous seasons. But 20 clubs met on Thursday and in a fresh decision over the rules, deadlocked the verdict at 10 votes for and 10 votes against five substitutes. This falls way below the 14-6 majority split needed for a rule to be changed. The separate vote to extend the number of substitutes able to be named on the bench from seven to nine did go through, however.

The Nigerian Army has denied reports claiming that its officers killed a 28-year-old pregnant woman, identified as Mary Pelemo in Magongo, Ogori/Magongo Local Government area of Kogi state. The elder brother of the deceased, Mr. Idowu Pelemo, who briefed newsmen on Thursday, alleged that some men in Army uniform on Wednesday at about 9 pm in Magongo, chased a driver from Ibilo in Edo State to Magongo in Kogi State. But, the Public Relation Officer of the Nigerian Army in Kogi state, Major Jafaru Muhammed in a telephone conversation with newsmen said “the Army was not involved in any operations please,”. Explaining further on how her sister was allegedly killed by officers of the Nigerian Army , the brother to the deceased, Palemo said the military men came in three convoys while they were chasing a driver who later escaped to an unknown destination. “They came with a Hilux van with registration number Lokoja 446 KG with another one painted in army colour with registration number 014 and chased a driver from Ibilo in Edo state to Magongo. ” Immediately the driver of the vehicle got to Magongo, he alighted from his vehicle and escaped. ” The men in army uniform started shooting sporadically as people started scampering for their lives, but my sister who was standing in front of her house was hit by stray bullets”. ” The men in army uniform rushed her to the hospital and escaped, but later my pregnant sister died that same night. “Those men in army uniform normally station their vans along Ageva. From what one of the soldiers told me, they wanted to arrest the driver because the driver and some of his colleagues disrespected some of their officers in Okene,” he said.

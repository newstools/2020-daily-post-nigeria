President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, felicitated with new World Boxing Federation (WBF) International Super Featherweight Champion, Ridwan Oyekola, “The Scorpion’’. Buhari, in a congratulatory message issued by his spokesman, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja, joined all Nigerians to celebrate the historical feat after 57 years. The president affirmed that Oyekola’s victory over an Argentine boxer, Lucas Montessino, brought more glory to Nigeria, in a sport “where another Nigerian, Anthony Joshua, consistently blazes the trail.” Buhari, therefore, enjoined youths to diligently follow their passion to the point of global recognition and celebration. He believed the new Super Featherweight Champion realised his dream after many years of focus and discipline, urging more commitment to sustain his place in history, after the Late Dick Tiger. Buhari equally commended the Local Organising Committee for the WBF Title Match, which held in Nigeria.

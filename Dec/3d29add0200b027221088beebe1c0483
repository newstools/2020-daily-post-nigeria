President Muhammadu Buhari has expressed sadness over the death of Prof. Habu Galadima, the Director-General, National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies (NIPSS). Buhari described the late DG as an intellectual colossus who stood tall in the field of scholarship and knowledge. “Galadima was an eloquent and remarkable intellectual whose contributions to scholarship were vast and remarkable, and Nigeria will continue to remember him for these contributions,” the President said while commiserating with his family, friends, the government and people of Nasarawa State. The statement made available to DAILY POST by Garba Shehu, his spokesman, said that President Buhari added that “with the death Galadima, NIPPS and Nigeria at large has lost one of the best DGs ever appointed to head the institute.” He prayed to Allah to forgive the soul of the departed and reward his good deeds with Al Jannah.

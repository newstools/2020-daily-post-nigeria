The Presidency on Wednesday alerted the general public on an alleged smear campaign in the works against President Muhammadu Buhari and his office by those it described as disgruntled political elements in the country. According to Femi Adesina, in a statement on Wednesday, these politicians have been shopping for pliant online media that will serve as accomplices in their nefarious act. Adesina claimed that these politicians’ game plan is to launch campaign of calumny in the coming days against the President. According to him they are plotting to portray President Muhammadu Buhari would “as not being in charge of the country, a narrative already started from a procured offshore medium by the instigators.” He further claimed that money and other attractive inducements are being offered to the online media to cook up unsubstantiated stories against the President all to sow seeds of discord and discontent in the country. He called on Nigerians to disregard such stories when they come across them, urging them to be wary and discerning in what they consume as news. “President Buhari remains focused and single-minded in his determination to serve the country to the best of his ability, bringing change to different facets of our national life,” Adesina said. He said that the President’s performance in the area of infrastructure such as construction roads, rail, bridges, airports round the country and even agriculture, testify that the Buhari is in control. “The fight against corruption, insecurity, and retooling of the economy also proceed apace, and the Buhari Administration will not be distracted, and will continue to serve with heart and might, irrespective of all shenanigans,” Adesina maintained.

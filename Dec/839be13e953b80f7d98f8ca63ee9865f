Ekiti State Governor, Dr Kayode Fayemi has commiserated with the family of the late business mogul and former Presidential aspirant, Chief Harry Akande, who passed on Saturday, aged 77. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Yinka Oyebode, the Governor described Akande’s death as an unfortunate and irreparable loss, not only to members of his family and the good people of Oyo State but to the nation at large. The Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum said the late Akande worked his way to the top, built a solid business empire and became influential across the globe through the dint of hard work, brilliance and diligence. Fayemi said the Ibadan-born Billionaire ventured into the Nigerian politics with the intent of using politics as a tool for social and economic change, but could not achieve his dreams of ruling the country as a presidential hopeful on the platform of the then All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP). The Governor, however, said Chief Harry Akande played politics without bitterness because his decision to participate in politics was to deepen democracy and create a system that caters for the masses and not for self-aggrandisement or wealth acquisition. “The news of Chief Akande’s death came as a shock. He was indeed a great man and a refined politician who envisioned a system that would cater for the Nigerian masses. There’s no doubt that he had a great reputation across the globe as a successful businessman and a peace-loving politician. “It is my prayer that the Lord will grant him eternal rest and give his family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. On behalf of the Government and people of Ekiti State, I commiserate with the Government and people of Oyo State”, the Governor said.

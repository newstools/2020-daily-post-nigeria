Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has given reasons his team failed to beat Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday. Mourinho also revealed what he told Tottenham players at half-time during the encounter against Crystal Palace. Goals from Harry Kane and Jeffrey Schlupp ensured both Tottenham and Palace got a point each at Selhurst Park. Speaking after the game, Mourinho told BBC: “I am experienced with football and the Premier League, and I told the players what could happen, and it happened. “Against Palace, the way they play you need the ball, you need to create because if not they are the sort of team that put the long ball into the box and what can happen, happens. “You can look at the game in two perspectives, one is that we lost two points or another is that we have one more point than we did yesterday. “I am never OK with a point, every game we go to win and if sometimes we don’t win it because of credit to the opponent and sometimes it is because we should do better. Today I think it was a bit of both.”

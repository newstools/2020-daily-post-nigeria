Corruption, unemployment and poor education among Northern youths has been identified as the major impediment to solving the insecurity problems bedevilling the region. This position was submitted by the Nigeria Police and the Jama’atut Tajdidil Islamic group during a two-day seminar on the Contributions of Religious Leaders Towards Tackling Social and Security Challenges in Northern Nigeria. The meeting was organized to draft religious leaders into cooperating with security agencies to tackle the security challenges facing the region. The State Commissioner of Police Mr Habu Sani said, “today challenges facing the tackling of general insecurity in the nation and the North particularly is corruption which is the foundation of the whole problem”. The Commissioner of Police represented by SP Haruna Abdulkadir at the seminar listed other impediments in tackling insecurity in Nigeria as unemployment among youths, lack of essential commodities and lack of sound education among the large population of the country. He said the remedy to all the challenges is governments to provide employment opportunities for youths or training them on artisanship. “Religious leaders must be role models for their followers, and be seen to protect the fundamental rights of other sects, religious beliefs and teachings. The National Chairman of the Tajididl Islamy Sheik Abubakar Mujahid Muhammad said the security of lives and properties lies with the government and they should be seen to be tackling it because it is only the government that has the mandate to do so. Mujahid emphasized the need for the strengthening of community policing, empowerment of the youth and resolution of communal crises involving farmers and herders and the religious conflicts in the middle belt.

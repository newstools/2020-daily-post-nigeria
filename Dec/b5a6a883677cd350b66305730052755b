The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, on Wednesday, gave government condition for its members to resume their duties. ASUU President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi said lecturers would return to classes when government provide conducive teaching environment in line with COVID-19 protocols. Ogunyemi disclosed this while fielding questions from journalists in Abuja, after calling off the nine months strike. Representatives of both ASUU and federal government had met to strengthen out agreements reached. However, Ogunyemi said: “We usually said we did not close the universities, government remains the owner of the universities, be it state or federal. “As far as we are concerned, we are ready to resume classes. But government should make the environment conducive for us to work within the context of the emerging trend of COVID-19. “So, we can’t tell government not to open but we have the right to insist that the COVID-19 protocols should be observed and the requirements for observing the protocols should be met.”

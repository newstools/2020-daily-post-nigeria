Manchester United midfielder, Fred, has broken his silence since he was sent off in the 3-1 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday night. The Red Devils fell to their second loss in the competition against the Ligue 1 champions. Neymar opened scoring in the first half, before Marcus Rashford’s shot was deflected in. Marquinhos made it 2-1, before Fred was issued a second booking. Neymar sealed the win deep into stoppage time. Fred has now posted on Instagram, admitting it “wasn’t the best night” for him or Manchester United. “It wasn’t the best night, but we kept working for the best. Always strong mind. We are United! #MUFC” he wrote. United remain top of the group ahead of PSG and RB Leipzig on goal difference, but must now avoid defeat to the Bundesliga side in their last group fixture.

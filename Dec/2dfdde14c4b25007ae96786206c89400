Ahead of Saturday’s local government election in Kogi State, the state Commissioner of Police, Ede Ayuba Ekpeji, has warned troublemakers especially those that will masquerade as political thugs to stay away from the polling booths and collation centers. Ekpeji, who gave the warning in a statement issued by the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, DSP William Ovye Aya on Friday, tasked parents to equally warn their wards to desist from any act capable of undermining the credibility of the electoral process. The statement quoted the commissioner as saying that “the full wrath of the law will be applied on anybody caught breaching the law regulating the conduct of the election.” He assured electorates that the command has deployed adequate security across the nooks and cranny of the state in collaboration with other security agencies to ensure adequate security of lives and property during and after the election. Ekpeji further stated that the command’s priority is to ensure violence free election, adding that, ” in order to achieve this, members of the public are urged to fully cooperate with the security agencies to guard against criminal elements hijacking/disrupting the process of election.”

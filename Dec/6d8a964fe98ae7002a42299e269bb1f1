Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta will be saddled with a lot of pressure due to the quest to get back to winning ways as they entertain Southampton at the Emirates Arena. The young Spaniard will have to contend for the available points against the Saints with a starting eleven, without some star players. In defence, Arsenal manager will most likely play without David Luiz and Sead Kolasinac, along with right back Hector Bellerin who will be absent for one game after reaching a total of 5 yellow cards in the English topflight. Mikel Arteta (Arsenal manager) will face the same case in midfield, where Ghana’s Thomas Partey is ruled out after being hauled off against London side Tottenham Hotspurs. The home side will also make do without Granit Xhaka for three matches after he was sent off on Sunday against Burnley. The lifeline for the Gunners is related to Ivorian winger Pepe. The former Lille forward makes a return from his domestic ban following his impressive showing in Europe already this term. And he will be keen to make up for the lost time on the pitch with a credible outing against the visitors. Arsenal’s predicted line-up against Southampton. Bernd Leno; Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Rob Holding, Gabriel Magalhaes, Kieran Tierney; Mohamed Elneny, Ceballos Dani; Nicolas Pepe, Willian Borges da Silva, Bukayo Saka; Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

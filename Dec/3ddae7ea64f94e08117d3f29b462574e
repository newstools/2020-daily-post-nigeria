Mr Kayode Fayemi, the Governor of Ekiti State, has insisted that the Nigerian military is no longer in a position to single-handedly tackle the security challenges in the country effectively. Fayemi made the claims on Wednesday when members of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) paid a visit to the Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, over the recent massacre of rice farmers by Boko Haram insurgents in the state. In the statement titled, ‘Governors Forum: Security challenges are beyond the military,’ Fayemi said Nigerian military is overwhelmed and needs support to tackle security challenges. “But what happened in the last three days is by far beyond any imagination, it was a massacre, and it was one that none of us could come to terms easily,” Fayemi said. “The reality we can all say, and I personally as a security scholar, the reality, I can see is that our military is overwhelmed. Our military is no longer in a position to single-handedly tackle this menace effectively. “It’s not a criticism of our military if one were to suggest a coalition beyond that will even include our neighbouring countries, who are probably more experienced in fighting an asymmetrical war. It’ll not be a loss of our pride as a country.” “This isn’t a visit to gratify ourselves, no, it’s an expression of also our own frustration. “We cannot bring back the people we’ve lost in the last couple of days, but if we don’t take the necessary steps the entire nation will be consumed by this insurgency,” He added. Other governors who were part of the condolence visit to Zulum include Aminu Tambuwal Waziri, the Governor of Sokoto and the Vice Chairman of the Forum, Abubakar Bello, the Governor of Niger State, and Atiku Bagudu, the Governor of Kebbi State.

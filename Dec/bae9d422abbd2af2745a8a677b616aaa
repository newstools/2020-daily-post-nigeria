The Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has said that police will not tolerate another round of End SARS protest in the country. The IG, who was in Anambra to inspect the level of damage done on police facilities in the state, charged men of the state police command to ensure that any further protest was nipped in the bud. He charged the police to resist any attempt to attack government properties, as well as police formations in the country. “The officers and men (of the force) have been ordered to ensure that law and order are maintained in their various formations,” he said. At the Anambra State Police Command headquarters where the IG addressed top officers of the command, he charged them to brace up and protect the country. The Anambra State Commissioner of Police, John Abang, who led the IG round some affected facilities said, “It was heart-rending when misguided miscreants and hoodlums suddenly launched vicious and murderous attacks on our personnel and facilities from the night of 21st October 2020 in Nnewi through to the evening of 24th October 2020 in Uli, mostly in Anambra South. “Regrettably, at the end of these callous attacks, the hoodlums had murdered four of our personnel and injured about fifteen others.”

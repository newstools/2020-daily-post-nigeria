Aubameyang believes the clash against Tottenham will be an opportunity to lift the spirits of Arsenal squad and fans. “I cannot wait for the derby on Sunday,” Aubameyang wrote in Arsenal’s matchday programme for their Europa League tie against Rapid Vienna on Thursday. “I think this is the game that we have to make into a turning point for us this season. There’s nothing better than this game to give you that opportunity to turn things around. “We have to understand that if we can win this game, then everyone will change their mindset. “A big result in the derby can really lift the players, the fans – everyone. “We know it will be a tough game, they are playing well at the moment, to tell the truth, but we have to take care of our game, how we want to play the game, and make it all about us. “We are waiting for this game – we need to give everything to get the win and change our situation.” The kick-off time for the match is 5:30 pm, Nigerian time.

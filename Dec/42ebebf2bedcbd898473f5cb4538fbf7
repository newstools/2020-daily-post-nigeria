If there’s one thing that Amstel Malta is known for, it’s its unique support for young creatives, while providing healthy and nutritious beverages for an active lifestyle. Once again, the brand has launched a challenge that gets your creative juices flowing. Now you can join in the quest to find the next design genius through this challenge tagged #Amstelbyme by creating a mind-blowing design for the Amstel Malta Ultra brand. From the 4th to the 12th of December, Amstel Malta Ultra is challenging Nigerian creatives to develop a unique design for the first of its kind limited edition range kit. Participants will be asked to draw inspiration from the recently launched Amstel Malta Ultra sleek can. All you have to do is design a t-shirt and matching shorts which will be produced by the Amstel Malta Ultra brand. The idea is for followers to create their unique designs, post a picture of their designs alongside a can of the new Amstel Malta Ultra on their Instagram pages using the hashtag #AmstelByMe and tag @AmstelMalta. You also need to follow @AmstelMalta to participate. The winner walks away with a cash prize of 100,000 naira and also earns the bragging rights of having their design produced as merchandise by Amstel Malta Ultra in partnership with workout clothing brand – Cegar by the amazing Cee-C.

Police in Anambra State have arrested three persons for allegedly collecting illegal revenue in the state, without the knowledge of the state government. The activities of illegal revenue collectors in the state have been a source of worry to the state government as they (illegal revenue collectors) constantly harass people in various markets in the state. In reaction to their activities, the state government last Monday ordered that all revenue collection be discontinued as a way to check their activities. But three persons, Paul Nnamdi Okonkwo ‘m’ aged 40years of Amafor village, Nkpor, Chukwura Ebube ‘m’ aged 23years of Amafor village,Nkpor and Cynthia Agbaero ‘f’ of Afisiri village in Ugheli North LGA of Delta State who defied the order were on Wednesday arrested by men of the state police command. SP Haruna Mohammed, spokesperson of Anambra State Police Command, who disclosed the news of the arrest said they were picked at MCC junction Obosi and Upper Iweka area. He said, “Suspects claimed they were revenue collectors hired by one Hon. Innocent Offordile alleged to be the SSA to the Governor on Security and Chairman Enforcement and Compliance Committee. “He has also been invited by the Police for questioning in order to ascertain his level of involvement or otherwise after which suspects would be brought to book.” Mohammed said because of the ban of all revenue on the roads by Anambra State Government, police and other law enforcement agencies in the state will continue to ensure the strict enforcement of government decision banning revenue collection on all the roads in the state.

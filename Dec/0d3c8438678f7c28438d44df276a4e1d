Former Tottenham Hotspur manager, Tim Sherwood, has identified defender, Andreas Christensen, as the player who cost Chelsea three points against Aston Villa in the Premier League on Monday. Sherwood blamed Christensen for Aston Villa’s equalizer against Chelsea, stating that the centre-back laid down on the floor like a baby instead of getting back in position to defend against the host. Goals from Olivier Giroud and Anwar El Ghazi ensured both Chelsea and Aston Villa played a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge. “When you look at Villa, when I see their team sheet come out I can pretty much guess apart from one or two players, it’s a settled team,” Sherwood told Premier League Productions. “It’s a complete contrast to Chelsea, you don’t know who’s going to play. “He tried to mix it up at the back no Silva, no Zouma today and it cost him. “Because Christiansen, that is not good enough. “I would be saying to Christiansen after the game, why were you lying on the floor? Why did you not get up and prevent that goal from being scored? You weren’t hurt, what are you laying down there for trying to feign injury to come off, you have cost us the game today. “You have cost us three points’. ‘Yes, Villa pushed on, and they deservedly got their point. ‘But that is crucial, that’s not good enough, you are a big, strong centre-back, don’t lay down on the floor like a baby, get up and get on with it for your team. Not good enough,” he added.

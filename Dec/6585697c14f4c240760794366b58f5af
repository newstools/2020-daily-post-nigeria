The 29 traditional rulers in Ikeduru Local Government Area of Imo State, Thursday, embarked on a protest, demanding that the kidnapped Auxiliary Bishop of Owerri Catholic Archdiocese, Chikwe Moses be released from the hands of his captors without unhurt. His Royal Highness, Eze Ambassador Marcel Okwadikesinachi, who is the Chairman of Ikeduru Council of Traditional Rulers, while speaking to journalists during a libation exercise undertaken by the monarchs today, expressed regret that what is obtainable in politics is gradually creeping into the Christendom. He described the situation as unfortunate and unacceptable. He said, “We have come out in our numbers to register our grievances on the sudden disappearance of our son who has done nothing to deserve this. “Bishop Chikwe Moses is from Ikeduru and will soon be officially confirmed the substantive Bishop of Owerri Archdiocese in the state. “We demand his immediate release because he does not in any way deserve such ill treatment. “He is neither a politician nor a businessman. What then are they chasing after? Whoever is behind this dastardly act should do well to release him. “Sincerely speaking, I was shocked to the bone marrow when I heard the news of Bishop Chikwe’s kidnap. I asked myself, what would warrant the kidnap of a man who is harmless, a man who has dedicated himself to the services of God and humanity. “We, therefore, urge the security agencies to step up actions towards fishing out those behind this dastardly act,” he concluded. DAILY POST state correspondent reported that the monarchs assembled at a junction (Amanwaozuzu) in Ikeduru and poured libations, cursing the hands behind the Bishop’s kidnap. Meanwhile, tension is heightened as there has not been any information or communication from the abductors of the Catholic prelate who was whisked away on Sunday morning.

Former Arsenal captain, Patrick Vieira, has been fired as coach of Nice, the club announced on Friday. Vieira has been dismissed following a run of five consecutive defeats. The final straw for the 44-year-old was Thursday’s 3-2 defeat at home to Bayer Leverkusen, which confirmed their exit from the Europa League. His assistant, Adrien Ursea, will take charge of the team from this weekend. “In a meeting after last night’s match, the Nice board informed Patrick Vieira of its decision to put an end to their collaboration,” the club said in a statement. “Patrick Vieira put all his heart and professionalism into his service for OGC Nice over the last two and a half years.” Vieira was given the job in 2018, but has come under pressure since last week’s defeat at home to struggling Dijon, a result that left Nice in the bottom half of Ligue 1.

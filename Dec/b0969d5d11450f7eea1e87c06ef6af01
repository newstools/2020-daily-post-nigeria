The Kwara State Government has expressed dismay and disappointment over the discovery of serious corrupt acts in some of its state-owned tertiary institutions. The state Commissioner, Ministry of Tertiary Education, Science and Technology, Hajia Sa’adatu Modibbo Kawu, made this revelation at a monthly briefing with heads of state tertiary institutions. She said the discovery was based “on revelations coming out from reports of the visitation panels set up to investigate the rots in some institutions over a period of time.” DAILY POST reports that the reports detected numerous atrocities ranging from abuse of office, impunity and misappropriation of scarce resources by people saddled with the responsibility of overseeing the day to day affairs of the institutions. Hajia Modibbo Kawu, however, “vowed to use the instrumentality of her office to right the wrongs and ensure every Kobo illegally taken is returned to the state coffers.” She emphasised the need for the various heads of institutions to consider equity and fairness in the appointment of principal officers, going forward. The commissioner further noted that the distribution of key appointments must unilaterally touch down on all the three Senatorial districts of the state as a matter of necessity. “As progressives, we must not allow divisive tendencies to come between us, as all hands must be on deck always. You must not see yourself as an end, but means to achieve an end. “There is no gainsaying the fact that little or nothing can be achieved without cooperation. “In lieu of the zero tolerance for corruption and indiscipline of this administration, you must never be found wanting, and always consult widely before sensitive decisions are taken to avoid costly mistakes,” the commissioner cautioned.

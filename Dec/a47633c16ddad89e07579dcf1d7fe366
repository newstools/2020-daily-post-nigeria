Kwara State will from Thursday, December 24, 2020, impose a partial statewide lockdown between 12 am and 4.30 am, until further notice. This is part of the safety guidelines announced by the government to mitigate the second wave of the spread of the Coronavirus infectious disease in the state. Civil servants are to work from their homes, with only essential workers, especially in the health sector exempted, while virtual meetings are encouraged. The government said, proper use of face masks in public space is mandatory, hence the protocol of ‘ No face mask, no entry’ must apply at all public places. According to the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, “Concerts, carnivals, clubbing are not to be allowed until further notice. “Worship centres are not to allow congregations exceeding 50 percent of the maximum capacity of the venue. This is to allow for physical distancing.” He said other gatherings, formal and informal exceeding 50 people are disallowed. Transporters, he added, are to enforce all COVID-19 safety protocols, including proper use of face masks by drivers and passengers, warning that sanctions will apply to defaulters. He said security agencies will deploy all lawful means to enforce the safety guidelines which are subject to review as situations dictate. “Provisions of the Kwara State’s Infectious Diseases Regulations 2020, shall apply to all offenders,” he warned.

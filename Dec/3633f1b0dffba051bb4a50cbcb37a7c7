The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has approved waivers for new members. This would allow them contest party primaries ahead of the 2023 elections without waiting for two years as required hitherto. On Tuesday, President Muhammadu Buhari presided over the APC NEC meeting held at the State House, Abuja. The gathering told the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to stop “politicizing” insecurity in Nigeria. The APC body urged the opposition and all stakeholders to join hands with the federal government to end the challenge. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo; Senate President, Ahmad Lawan; House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila; Chairman, Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and Yobe Governor, Mai Mala Buni; governors and some party officials attended the parley. However, all party structures at states, polling units, wards, local governments, and zones have been dissolved. Also, the tenure of the Buni-led Caretaker Committee has been extended by six months.

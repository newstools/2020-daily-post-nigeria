The Sole Administrator of Shinkafi Local Government Council, Sani Galadima Shinkafi, has refuted the claim that there was a terror attack in Shinkafi Local Government Area of Zamfara State. He said the peace accord and reconciliation initiative by the present administration of Governor Bello Matawalle has helped to reduce the banditry activities and other security challenges in the Local Government. He made the statement in Kaura Namoda at a town hall meeting organized for Local Governments in Zamfara-North senatorial zone by the State Ministry of Budget and Economic Planning, which was aimed to derive real projects to be executed as planned in the 2021 budget. “Despite successes achieved by the State government and the Security agencies in tackling security challenges in Shinkafi Local Government, there was still need to prioritize the construction of Zangero-Badarawa-Kware-Kurya about 60 kilometer road that linked Zamfara with some parts of Katsina and Sokoto states. “By the said project which bears the weight of over 600,000 populace in the 2021 budget, the security operatives would then find it easier to reach any targeted community that may lodge distress calls for rescue, and the construction of the road would also facilitate easy transportation of farm produce to the targeted markets”, he said. However, number of observations were presented by representatives of the four benefitting Local Government councils of the zone, which include Kaura Namoda, Birnin Magaji, Zurmi and Shinkafi Local Government Areas of the state. The town hall meeting, according to the Director and Economic Planning, Hamza Salihu who, represented the State Commissioner, Ibrahim Jibo Magayaki, was to inform the zone on the planned projects to be executed for their wellbeing. “The main reasons for organizing the town hall meeting was to read out the list of projects earmarked by the State government for the zone, and on the other hand, to listen to them whether they may suggest another important project that was not captured in the 2021 budget. “Being first of its kind in the State, the town hall meeting on the budget was aimed at providing enabling environment for the teeming beneficiaries to take part in the budget decision where they could either support the planned projects or replace them with more important ones”, Magayaki said.

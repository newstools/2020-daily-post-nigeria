The head of the Citadel Global Community Church, Pastor Tunde Bakare, has dismissed allegations of being funded by the All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Bola Tinubu, ahead of the 2023 general elections. The cleric had recently chided those against Tinubu‘s rumoured presidential ambition. Bakare likened the former Lagos Governor to the Biblical Jephthah, noting that he had fought and won many battles for the Yoruba people. In his sermon on Sunday, Bakare who has repeatedly declared he will be Nigeria’s President, replied critics denouncing him for speaking in Tinubu’s favour. The pastor noted that he expected that his message would be well digested before judgment is passed. Bakare said the bathwater and the baby were both thrown out “by self-appointed undertakers who think the way forward in our dilemma as a nation is to uproot the tares and separate them from the wheat long before the harvest time ordained by God”. “This set of individuals went to the extreme of calling me delusional, while others concluded that money must have changed hands for me to say the things that were said contrary to my previous stand concerning the same person. “You think somebody will pay me for what I am doing? No one is rich enough to do it. No one in this country or elsewhere is rich enough. And I am not for sale because I have been bought. “I was bought by the Blood of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary and no other price can match that. And if you know of anyone who has given me money at any time to do what I am doing, expose it,” he dared.

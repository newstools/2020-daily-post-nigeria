Manchester United have made a u-turn over their interest in making a move for Red Bull Leipzig defender, Dayot Upamecano, in the next transfer window. Upamecano has long been linked with a move to Man United, with the Red Devils manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer viewing the Frenchman as perfect for the English Premier League (EPL). The 22-year-old has a release clause of £42m in his contract with the Bundesliga side. However, according to the Athletic, Man United’s interest in Upamecano has now cooled. The report added that Bayern Munich are now leading the way for the player’s signature. Speaking on his future at Leipzig, Upamecano said recently that he was not in a hurry to leave the German club. “I extended my contract with Leipzig because I feel good with my teammates,” Upamecano said. “My coach is giving me confidence. He is learning as well, but he gives me confidence, and it improves my level. “I’ve been in Leipzig for more than three years. I feel good. I’ve been in demand, I talked to some clubs, it’s true, but I’m not in a hurry. “We’ll see what happens in the future.”

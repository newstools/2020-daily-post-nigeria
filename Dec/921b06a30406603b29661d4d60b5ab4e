The National Basketball Association, NBA has announced that 48 players tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19)on Wednesday. This is a dramatic increase over the zero positive tests earlier confirmed during last season’s quarantine bubble in Florida. The league said the positive tests are the result of 546 tests carried out between November 24-30 as the NBA gets set to begin preseason games in nine days. The NBA disclosed that it would be testing all of its players daily throughout the season. The new results show the league has a positivity rate of 8.8 per cent, which is high. This means players who tested positive will miss workouts for at least 10 days or more if showing symptoms, according to NBA’s new COVID-19 protocols. The NBA’s first pre-season games will begin December 11 with the regular season scheduled to begin less than two weeks later.

The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) has expressed sadness over the recent gruesome killing of more than 40 Nigerians at Koshebe village in Borno State. The victims were rice farmers of Zabarmari community in Jere Local Government Area. They were slaughtered by Boko Haram last Saturday and buried on Sunday. On Thursday, Felix Omobude, PFN National President, in a statement on Thursday, said the heinous crime was a stark reminder of the deplorable level of security in Nigeria. He regretted that despite the economic situation, farmers in pursuit of their livelihood were hacked to death. “President Muhammadu Buhari must step up to guarantee the security and safety of all the citizens of Nigeria, irrespective of their location, ethnicity or faith. “For a government that came into office on the back of a promise to prioritise security, the recent turn of events in the country, with banditry, kidnapping and violence running riot is sad and unfortunate. “We call on President Buhari to take on-board suggestions put forward by stakeholders in proffering solutions to the chronic challenge.” Omobude commiserated with the families of the deceased, the government and people of Borno. PFN prayed for comfort and continued strength for citizens in the North-East. The statement appealed to all Christians to be more prayerful as the Christmas season approaches.

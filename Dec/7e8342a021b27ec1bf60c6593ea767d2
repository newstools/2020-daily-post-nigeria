American wrestler and actor, Jonathan Huber, who was best known for his time in WWE, under the ring name, Luke Harper, is dead. The father-of-two, who is also known as Brodie Lee, died on Boxing Day at the age of 41 after a hard-fought battle with a non-COVID-19 related lung issue. His wife, Amanda Huber, announced her husband’s death in a lengthy post via her Instagram account. Amanda wrote: “My best friend died today. “I never wanted to write out those words. My heart is broken. The world saw him as the amazing @brodielee (fka Luke Harper) but he was my best friend, my husband, and the greatest father you would ever meet. “No words can express the love I feel or how broken I’m right now. “He passed surrounded by love ones after a hard-fought battle with a non-COVID-19 related lung issue. The @mayoclinic is literally the best team of doctors and nurses in the world who surrounded me with constant love. I have been surrounded by so much love and incredible people I can’t tag them all but they know who they’re and I don’t think they’ll ever know how thankful I’m for them.”

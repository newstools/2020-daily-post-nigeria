The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, Majority Leader and others prevented the invitation of President Muhammadu Buhari to brief the House on the insecurity facing the country. During the consideration of a motion moved by Ahmed Satomi on the gruesome murder of 43 rice farmers in Borno State, a co-sponsor of the motion, Ahmed Jaha raised a point of order that some of the resolutions agreed to in the motion had been deleted. Jaha who is also from Borno State said that his motion called for the invitation of the President to brief the House on security situation in the country. To forestall moving the motion, Gbajabiamila appealed to Jaha that the resolution to summon the president was removed at the behest of the Chair, adding that security matters are not to be discussed in public. “He eliminated some of my prayers, the resolution is that we should invite the President to brief the House on Security.” The Speaker, Gbajabiamila, therefore, argued that such resolution will be counter productive.” The Majority Leader also argued that the “Security issue does not warrant the invitation of the President to brief the House. Shehu Koko also said that the leadership of the House should rather meet the President in the Villa. The comment generated uproar among members of the House. The Speaker, therefore, called for an executive session. The House is still behind closed doors.

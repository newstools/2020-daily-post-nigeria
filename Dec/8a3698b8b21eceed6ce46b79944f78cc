Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has explained the rationale behind the re-introduction of the open day in public schools in the state. DAILY POST gathered that the State government recently re-introduced open day in all public schools in the state and declared its resolve to re-introduce boys scouts in public schools in the state. Makinde has, however, explained why he re-introduced the open day in all public schools in the state. Makinde who spoke through the Chairman, Oyo State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Dr. Nurain Adeniran noted that the open day was re-introduced to ensure that teachers and parents monitored their wards. Adeniran who insisted that many parents do not know what their wards do in school added that the focus of the open day is to ensure proper monitoring of students from home to their schools. Adeniran while speaking at a press conference on Tuesday in Ibadan said the state government is monitoring schools to ensure compliance. He said, “We introduced open day in Oyo schools recently. We introduced it to enable the teachers and the parents to have interaction. “Many parents do not know what their children are doing in schools and many teachers do not know what the students are doing at home. “Many teachers do not know the background of the students, they do not know what the children are facing at home. “We introduced open day on the basis of that, in order to ensure interaction between the parents and the teachers. “And the ministry of education has approved it and we are monitoring all the schools in the state to endure compliance.”

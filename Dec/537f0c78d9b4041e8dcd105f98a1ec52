Mino Raiola, the agent to Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, has sensationally declared his career over. His bombshell comes less than 24hours to United’s must-not-lose Champions League clash at RB Leipzig. Raiola told Tuttosport: “I can say that it’s over for Paul Pogba at Manchester United.” Pogba’s future has been the subject of much speculation for months, but he remained at Old Trafford beyond the summer. The Frenchman has been linked with a return to his former club Juventus and Real Madrid. It remains to be seen if United will allow their most expensive signing leave.

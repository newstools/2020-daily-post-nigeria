Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, has said the Nigerian currency will regain its strength among the league of currencies. Adeboye said this on Saturday during the RCCG annual Holy Ghost Congress held at its International Headquarters along the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Pastor Adeboye asked God to intervene in Nigeria’s financial sector and change the hearts of policymakers who deliberately devalue the nation’s currency. Adeboye recalled that there was a time, some decades ago, he needed N5,000, during the church’s inaugural convention when the naira was powerful and N5,000 was a lot of money. Adeboye said, “During our first convention here at the Redemption Camp, I ran out of money. My wife came to me in the morning, ‘Sir, we need N5,000.’ “Naira was powerful then. It will become powerful again. Those who are deliberately devaluing our naira, before tomorrow morning, God will intervene. “I asked my wife, ‘Do you need it today or later?’ She said ‘today’. I didn’t have a kobo. I told her to go. I cried to God. It wasn’t long after that; one man drove in. “He asked what’s going on and then he put his hands in his pocket and brought out an envelope with some money. “I then called on my wife and asked her, ‘How much do you say you need?'”

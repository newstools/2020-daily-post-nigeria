Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that some Blues players will miss his side’s Premier League clash against Leeds United on Saturday night because he doesn’t have injuries in his squad. Lampard stated this at his pre-match press conference on Friday. According to him, every Chelsea player is fit for the Leeds clash at Stamford Bridge. Lampard’s men head to the game after defeating Sevilla 4-0 in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday night in Spain. “Everyone is fit,” Lampard said. “With Giroud, it’s not a case of giving any player assurances over game time because with a competitive squad like ours, that’s very difficult to do. “All you want is for players, when they are out of the team, to train well, get themselves in the team and perform like Oli did the other day because then that gives me nice problems. I am happy with him – his form is good, and he’s training well. “In that forward area, I have competition for places. Tammy Abraham has been playing very well for us this season, scoring goals and making assists. I never see anything negative from Oli, and I have huge respect for him. If he plays like he did against Sevilla, clearly he will get more opportunities to play because that was just a top-class performance.” Lampard added: “We are competitive in midfield. We don’t have injuries at the moment, and the numbers do mean some players will miss out on squads [to face Leeds United], but the quality of Billy [Gilmour] will hopefully mean he gets some minutes, particularly when we look at the Champions League game coming up in midweek. “More than that, I think Billy’s quality will shine through, but obviously there is competition in that area so we’ll have to see.” The kick-off time for the match is 9 pm, Nigerian time.

A Lagos based human rights lawyer, Malcolm Omirobo has been arrested for embarking on a one-man protest and demanding to see President, Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. DAILY POST reports that while attempting to progress into the villa, omirobo was approached by CSP Isah Hadejia who tried to stop him from continuing with the protest. Hadejia had promised to transmit his demands to the appropriate quarters. Speaking to newsmen, Omirobo insisted on proceeding with his match, adding that he has a constitutional right as a law-abiding citizen to protest at the villa as long as he remains peaceful without requiring to pre-inform any authorities of such visit. The Human Rights lawyer stressed that his protest was aimed at meeting the President with regards to what he described as genocide against Nigerians especially in the North East. He lamented the killing of about 43 Nigerian farmers who were working to promote Federal Governmentâ€™s rice sufficiency policy but were left unprotected and allowed to be gruesomely killed by members of Boko Haram. However, he was yet to conclude his press briefing when men of the Department of State Service arrived at the scene, bundled him into a vehicle and drove into the villa.

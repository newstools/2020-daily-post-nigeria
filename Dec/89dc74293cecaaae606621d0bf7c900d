President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, urged the released students of Government Science Secondary School, GSSS, in Kankara, Katsina State to stay focused on their studies. Buhari urged the students not to allow their experience with bandits distract them from their studies, NAN reports. He made the appeal while addressing the students at the Banquet Hall of the state’s Government House. The president also assured that his government would ensure security around schools across Nigeria. He said: “You students are very lucky, concentrate on your studies, don’t allow your terrible experiences in the hands of those heartless bandits distract you from your studies. “Put behind all the sufferings and concentrate on your studies. “The Federal Government will continue to strengthen security around all schools across the country.” Buhari stressed that the abduction of the students was a deliberate attempt to test the will of his administration. Recall that bandits had about a week ago abducted students of GSSS in Kankara area of the state. Last night, the students were released, following the intervention of security agents and a social-cultural organisation.

The lawmaker representing Otukpo/Ohimini Federal Constituency of Benue State in the House of Representatives, Blessing Onuh, on Friday, officially decamped from the All Progressives Grand Alliance to the All Progressives Congress. Onuh, who is the daughter of former Senate President, David Mark, was formerly in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) but decamped from the party to APGA after she lost the party’s primary for the House Seat to her uncle, Johnson Egli Ahubi. Although, she later defeated her uncle at the general election. Onuh’s decamping ceremony at Otukpo, Benue State on Friday was attended by the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, former Benue State governor and Minister for Special Duties, Sen. George Akume, Rep. Zainab Gimba and others. However, Sen. David Mark still remains a chieftain in the PDP.

One of President Muhammadu Buhari’s media aides, Tolu Ogunlesi, has hinted that there might be a fresh lockdown in the first quarter of 2021. Ogunlesi gave the hint in a tweet on Monday afternoon saying the measures will be “desperate attempts at curve-flattening”. “From a COVID-19 POV, looks like H1 2021 will be a lot like 2020 – restrictions, lockdowns, desperate attempts at curve-flattening. “That’s probably the second most daring roguish feat 2020 has pulled off – this act of deluding us all into regarding it as an aberration,” he wrote. Buhari ordered up to three months of lockdown across the country, as Nigeria battled the COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020. However, it appears the second wave of Coronavirus is sweeping the nation, with the number of infections rising. On Sunday night, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) confirmed 418 new COVID-19 infections, taking the country’s total cases to 73,175 cases.

West Brom have appointed Sam Allardyce as their manager. Allardyce, who has previously coached Everton and West Ham, has signed an 18-month contract. The deal includes a break clause at the end of the season if the Albion are relegated. Allardyce replaces Slaven Bilic who was sacked on Wednesday, following a 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Tuesday night. “In Sam, we have a man who has a proven Premier League pedigree with a track record of improving every club he has managed. “We believe and, more importantly, Sam believes we have a group of players that have the quality needed to give the club its best chance of Premier League survival,” West Brom sporting director, Luke Dowling, said. The Baggies have only won once this season and sit second bottom of the table, but are only two points behind 17th-place Burnley.

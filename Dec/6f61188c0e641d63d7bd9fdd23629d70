Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has spoken out on his situation at the club, as he enters the final six months of his contract. Messi submitted an official transfer request last summer, following Barca’s 8-2 humbling against Bayern Munich in last season’s Champions League quarter-finals. Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain were all mooted as possible next destinations for the 33-year-old, but he quickly saw his exit path blocked by Blaugrana and LaLiga officials. Messi eventually made a u-turn and remained with the Spanish giants in a bid to avoid a legal tussle. He, however, took aim at the Barca board, accusing former club president Josep Maria Bartomeu of failing to keep his promises. Messi is yet to extend his deal and will be free to commit to a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs in January. “The truth is that today I’m fine. It’s true that I had a very bad time in the summer,” Messi told La Sexta. “It came from before. What happened before the summer, because of how the season ended, the burofax and all that. Then I dragged it on a bit at the beginning of the season. “But today I’m fine and I feel like fighting seriously for everything that lies ahead, [I’m] excited. “I know that the club is going through a difficult time, at club level and everything that surrounds Barcelona, but I’m looking forward to it.”

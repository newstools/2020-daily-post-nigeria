Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has congratulated the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Mr. Tokunbo Abiru, on his emergence as the Senator-elect for Lagos East Senatorial District. The Governor in a statement released on Sunday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Gboyega Akosile, also congratulated the APC candidate for Kosofe State Constituency II, Mr. Obafemi Saheed, who emerged victorious in last Saturday’s by-election. The Governor described APC’s victory with a wide margin in the by-elections as a sound testament to the confidence the people of Lagos State have in the All Progressives Congress. He commended the electorate for coming out to perform their civic responsibilities and for voting in large numbers for the two candidates put forward by the APC. “I want to congratulate Mr. Tokunbo Abiru and Obafemi Saheed on their victory in last Saturday’s by-elections in Lagos East Senatorial district and Kosofe State Constituency II polls. Your emergence as federal and state lawmakers is a validation of peoples’ confidence in our dear party, the APC. “Right from the commencement of the process, we never doubted that Tokunbo Abiru and Obafemi Saheed would win the elections based on their credibility and the massive campaigns in all the nooks and crannies of Kosofe II Constituency and Lagos East Senatorial District. “The victory of the two candidates of our party in the by-elections clearly showed that APC remains a party to beat in Lagos, based on her achievements in the State since the beginning of the current political dispensation in 1999,” the statement said. The Governor urged the two newly elected lawmakers to continue with the tradition of excellent representation that Lagos legislators are known for.

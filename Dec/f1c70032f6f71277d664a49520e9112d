The INEC Presiding Officer, Oluwo-Amojo Str/Bayeku 003A polling unit, Igbogbo/ Bayeku, Mr Oluwakorede Ogunwede, on Saturday said that turnout of voters in the area was not encouraging. He also said that the card readers were also not identifying the fingerprints of the electorate. Ogunwede stated this in an interview with NAN on Saturday. “Since our arrival, we do not have many people around,” Ogunwede said. “We also have just one security personnel around, and the touts here are many. “The card readers also are giving us issues which are slowing down the process of voting.” Also reacting, Miss Barakat Suliamon, another Presiding Officer at unit 010A, said that voting could not start early because the list of names of voters was not available. “We left the original names of people in the office which has delayed the voting exercise a bit. “The turnout is not so encouraging, but we have people on the ground. “We are to force people here to strictly follow the COVID-19 guidelines,” she said.

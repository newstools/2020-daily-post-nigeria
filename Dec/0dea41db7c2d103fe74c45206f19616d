Arsenal would be looking to make it six wins in a row when they take on Dundalk in Thursday’s Europa League match. The London side has made a great start to their European aspiration and has already secured the first place in the group while Dundalk is winless and can only finish in bottom place in Group B. Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta is expected to make wholesale changes on the back of Sunday’s defeat to Tottenham Hotspur with the Gunners needing to quickly get over the defeat soonest. Here, DAILY POST analyses Arsenal’s possible line up against Irish side, Dundalk. Absent; Mesut Ozil (ineligible),Sokratis (ineligible),Willian Saliba (ineligible),Gabriel Martinelli (knee). Possible; Thomas Partey (muscle), Calum Chambers (knee), David Luiz (head). Ivorian winger Nicolas Pepe is out serving a three-match ban on the domestic front and looks set to start this match to keep his match fitness. It’s a similar case for Pablo Mari, who is gradually being eased back to fitness and should feature alongside Calum Chambers or Rob Holding, depending on the former’s match fitness ahead of the game. Young midfield star Miguel Azeez has made the bench on two occasions but has yet to feature. This could be the best chance of him getting game time. Joe Willock and Emile Smith Rowe are supposed to get time on the field of play while Folarin Balogun may be handed his first match in a much different Arsenal set-up. Arsenal’s line-up may include, Runar Alex Runarsson; Cedric Soares, Rob Holding, Pablo Mari, Sead Kolasinac; Miguel Azeez, Mohamed Elneny; Nicolas Pepe, Joe Willock, Emile Smith Rowe; Folarin Balogun.

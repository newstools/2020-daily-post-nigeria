The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos has described Saturday’s bye-elections in the state as a charade. Tokunbo Abiru of the All Progressives Congress (APC) defeated PDP flagbearer, Babatunde Gbadamosi, in Lagos East Senatorial poll. Similarly, Femi Saheed of the APC floored PDP candidate, Sikiru Alebiosu, to win Kosofe constituency 2 (House of Assembly) election. PDP Chairman in Lagos, Adedeji Doherty, alleged that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) allocated votes to the ruling party. He expressed confidence that the people will be rescued from APC and its leadership “that have held down Lagos State for over twenty years”. The politician said in an attempt to do image laundering after the End SARS embarrassment, “the APC in collaboration with INEC went about allocating ridiculous votes against the PDP”. He noted that this was to give the impression that the APC and “their leader” are still in firm control of Lagos. Doherty said voter apathy negates the figures “allotted” to the APC, insisting that less than 10 percent of voters took part in the elections. “We are all aware of the massive vote buying by the APC, using state funds. To the APC in Lagos, this devilish and draconian trend of cash for votes is worthy of celebration as evidence of control of the electorate, but we assure that this will end very soon.” The chairman told Lagosians that all hope is not lost, and promised that PDP would be repositioned positively for the 2023 elections. Doherty appealed to PDP members and supporters to remain faithful.

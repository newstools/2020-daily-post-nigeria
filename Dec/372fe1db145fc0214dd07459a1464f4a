Jose Mourinho would be in the home dugout, when Tottenham hosts Arsenal in Sunday’s North London Derby, but he could have easily been on the other side, the UK Times reports. Just over 12 months ago, pressure was mounting on Unai Emery at Arsenal. With Jose Mourinho still without a club, Arsenal’s head of football at the time Raul Sanllehi reportedly held talks over their job. Sanllehi was keen to sound out Mourinho and see if he would be a good fit to replace Emery at the Emirates. The discussion is said to have left Sanllehi impressed and he considered Mourinho as a potential successor to Emery. But it is claimed that Mourinho did not share his enthusiasm, and had reservations over working under the Arsenal hierarchy, claiming that the structure of the club “did not appeal” to him. He instead jumped at the Spurs’ job, after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked, because he saw their setup as more appealing, as well as instant Champions League football. They now sit top of the Premier League table after 10 matches.

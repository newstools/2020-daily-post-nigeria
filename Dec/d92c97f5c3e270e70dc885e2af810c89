Chelsea would welcome West Ham United at Stamford Bridge in the final EPL fixture of the week before Boxing Day. The Chelsea side is without a win in their three outings in all competitions, which also involves the consecutive defeat against Everton and Wolves. They cannot afford to drop more points as their London rivals West Ham United visits for this tie. The Blues boss, Frank (Lampard) has told his summer acquisitions to improve their performance following their defeat to Wolverhampton Wanderers in midweek and so he is expected to make changes against David Moyes’s men. Here, DAILY POST takes a look at how the Blues could line-up for this all-important encounter. Possible; Hakim Ziyech (hamstring), Callum Hudson-Odoi (hamstring) Callum Hudson-Odoi and Morocco’s Hakim Ziyech are back in training with his Chelsea teammate on Friday but it’s uncertain whether Lampard would use any of the two players in his team list against West Ham United. Olivier Giroud is expected to start for Chelsea having beaten off the competition with English striker Tammy Abraham. While Pulisic Christian is the best bet to feature on the right wings. Timo Werner’s barren spell in front of goal has led to criticism for the former RB Leipzig star to be dropped from the side. However, Lampard doesn’t have a plethora of options to make do with. Compatriot Kai Havertz is another player who’s switched off in terms of performance and this could potentially mean a return to the Blues side for Croatia’s Mateo Kovacic. He would be expected to play alongside the talented duo of Mason Mount and French’s N’Golo Kante in the midfield areas. Chelsea’s predicted line-up against West Ham United in a 4-3-3 Formation Mechanics. Edouard Mendy; Reece James, Kurt Zouma, Thiago Silva, Ben Chilwell; N’Golo Kante, Mateo Kovacic, Mason Mount; Christian Pulisic, Olivier Giroud, Timo Werner

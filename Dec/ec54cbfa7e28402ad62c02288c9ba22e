Senegalese striker, Demba Ba has opened up on what transpired in the dressing room during Tuesday’s aborted Champions League clash between his team, Basaksehir and PSG. The Champions League clash was abandoned with only 13 minutes played after the fourth official was said to have used a racist language to pinpoint the Turkish club’s assistant coach, Pierre Webo for a red card. Ba, who was on the touchline awaiting substitution before the incident, had confronted the officials over the issue. Ultimately, Basaksehir officials and players decided to abandon the fixture with the same referees and the game was restarted a day later, with PSG defeating the Turkish side 5-1. Ba, who formerly laced his boots for Chelsea and Newcastle, has lifted the lid on what officials and players of the Turkish side discussed in the dressing room after the incident. “It started by speaking to the right and the left, and then some raised their voices to say: ‘Either we all go out or none of us go out,’” Ba told BeIn Sport. “I was surprised by the reaction of certain players, notably Enzo Crivelli. “I told him: ‘Enzo, if they all go out, you go out. You’re 25 years old, you go out. “If you knew the violence with which he yelled at me to say: ‘No, I’m not going out.’ These are things that must be eradicated from the football field and if we don’t do anything today, it will continue. “He decided not to play on and he was followed by the team. They all stayed and we played the following day.”

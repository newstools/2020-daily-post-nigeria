Shehu Sani, a former Kaduna lawmaker, has outlined ways the Nigerian government can secure schools in the North. Sani, referring to the recent abduction of schoolboys in Kankara, Katsina State, told the government to create a special security unit for schools. The former lawmaker also advised the government to install CCTV, alarm systems in schools to keep children safe in school. Sani made this known in a thread on his Twitter page. His tweets read: “How to protect Schools in Northern Nigeria; Abolish boarding schools in rural areas, drill students and teachers on emergency security measures. “Create a special security unit for schools, build perimeter walls around schools, install CCTV and alarm systems in schools, intensify prayers.” Recall that some schoolboys were abducted from Government Science Secondary, Kankara on December 11th, 2020. The boys were however rescued on Thursday and returned to their parents.

Watford captain, Troy Deeney, has insisted that Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, could face be sacked if they lose to Burnley in the Premier League on December 13. Deeney said this while reacting to Arsenal’s 2-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. According to him, Arteta would be under pressure to keep his job. “I actually said on [last week’s] show I fancied Arsenal to get a result,” Deeney told talkSport. “Because they are that kind of team where they can just pull one out the bag. “But I’ll happily say I was massively wrong. Arsenal are in trouble. I’m happy for them that they are at home, but if they were playing Burnley away this week, I’d be very nervous for them. ‘I think he [Arteta] has to come under criticism, ultimately because of where they are. “For me, and I’ll go out on a limb here, if they lose [to Burnley] he is massively under pressure. “I’d be surprised, if they lose and the ones around them win, and they are looking more backwards than upwards, he would be under pressure to keep his job.”

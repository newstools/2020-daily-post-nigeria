Manchester United have begun talks with Independiente del Valle in a bid to sign their central midfielder, Moises Caicedo, according to Daily Record. The Red Devils expressed an interest in bringing the 19-year-old to England as the January transfer window approaches. The Premier League giants have now entered negotiations to sign Caicedo, with Independiente del Valle demanding an initial £5.5 million fee plus add-ons and a 20 per cent sell-on clause. Caicedo, who made his first-team debut for Independiente del Valle 14 months ago, has also drawn the interest of West Ham United. The 19-year-old has four international caps with the Ecuador national team. He scored his first international goal in Ecuador’s 4-2 win over Uruguay in October. Speaking earlier this month, Independiente del Valle General Manager, Santiago Morales, disclosed that the club is already considering an offer for Caicedo ahead of the January window. “We have received an offer from a European club for Moises Caicedo, we are negotiating the proposal,” Morales said. “It is most likely that he will not be in our team in 2021 due to the proposal we have received, it is very difficult to keep him.”

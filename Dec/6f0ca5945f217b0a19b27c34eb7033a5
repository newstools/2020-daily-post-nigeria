At least, five policemen were kidnapped by villagers in Aba Tuntun, a suburb of Ijebu-Igbo in Ogun State. DAILY POST reliably gathered that the Baale of Aba Tuntun had earlier petitioned the police, informing them that some people within his community were in possession of firearms, which they reportedly use for illegal activities in the area. It was gathered that the police, after receiving the petition, swung into action by conducting a raid with 15 officers and 35 local vigilantes on Thursday. The raid, sources said, was successful as six single barreled guns, 16 dane guns and 15 cartridges were recovered from the hoodlums, who were arrested by the police. However, pandemonium struck when the villagers allegedly waylaid the police officers as they were about to leave the Ogun community. “The villagers fired gunshots at the police and attacked them with other dangerous weapons. The DPO that led the team and some others sustained gunshot injuries. “Five officers and three vigilantes were kidnapped by the villagers. They made away with police, two AK-47 riffles, one pump action, one teargas, money and others,” a source told DAILY POST anonymously in Ogun. Meanwhile, our correspondent gathered that four of the five abducted officers and three civilians have been rescued. But, one Constable, Emmanuel Gene is still being held captive by the people, it was learnt. Also, the hoodlums who were earlier arrested by the police were set free, while two vehicles belonging to the police were damaged by the villagers. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, has confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. Oyeyemi said the police had reinforced to the area in order to rescue the missing police constable. He said three suspects have been arrested and they are helping the police in their investigation.

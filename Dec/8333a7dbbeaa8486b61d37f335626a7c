Bola Tinubu, National leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has warned those working against Nigeria’s unity. Tinubu said those working against Nigeria’s unity will not achieve their selfish aim. The APC National Leader spoke at the wedding Fatiha of the daughter of an Islamic scholar, Sheikh Muhammad Bin-Uthman in Kano, yesterday. He maintained that they will not allow those he described as “dividers” to achieve their selfish interest. Tinubu also called for peace and unity among Nigerians so dividers can further fail in the bid to achieve their aim. “Dividers will not stop in doing things they think can divide us, but the truth of the matter is, we will not allow them to achieve their selfish interest,” Tinubu said. The former Lagos State governor stated that Nigeria’s unity is one of the major areas that should be given more priority.

The Federal Government has urged Nigerians not to lose hope in the capability of the military in tackling terrorists following Saturday’s killing of some farmers by suspected Boko Haram terrorists in Borno. The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, made the plea on Tuesday in Lagos, NAN reports. Mohammed asked Nigerians to continue to support the men and women in uniform who are fighting the terrorists with determination. He also described the killings as “an act of cowardice and savagery by a group of deranged terrorists.” “Going after soft targets is an act of weakness and desperation by the terrorists who have suffered huge setbacks in the hands of the military in recent times. “The aim of a losing terror group is to go after soft targets in order to stay relevant and it’s not only Boko Haram that does that. “In 2019, Al-Shabab attacked DusitD2 Complex in Nairobi, Kenya, killing more than 20. “Also, the Peshawar school massacre of 16 December 2014 in Pakistan, by six gunmen affiliated with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, left about 150 people dead and most of the students,’’ he said.

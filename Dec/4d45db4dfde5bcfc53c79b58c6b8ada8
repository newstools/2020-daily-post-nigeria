Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture, has challenged broadcast media in the to take the lead in telling the Nigerian story. He said this will help guard against distortion of facts by a section of the foreign media. Lai Mohammed spoke in Oko, Oyo State, while commissioning the 89.3 FM Station on Saturday. “I challenge broadcast media in Nigeria to take the lead in telling the Nigerian story…” he said. “A situation in which foreign broadcast stations arrogate to themselves the power to tell our own story gives room for distortion of facts. The Minister noted that had the local broadcast media lived up to their billing, CNN would have relied on them for news about End SARS in particular and other happenings in Nigeria. “A situation in which the local media will rely and quote a foreign broadcast media, for an event that happened in Nigeria, is an anomaly. It has to stop,” he said

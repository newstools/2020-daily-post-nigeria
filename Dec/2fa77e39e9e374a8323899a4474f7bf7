Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries, on Tuesday, came hard on President Muhammadu Buhari over the level of insecurity and economic challenges in the country. Suleman described the Buhari-led administration as the worst government ever in Nigeria. He recalled that Buhari rode to power on the promises of fighting corruption, insecurity, and improving Nigeria’s economy. In a tweet, Apostle Suleman lamented that the current government had failed to fulfill its promises to Nigerians. According to Suleman: “4-point agenda of this govt was anti-corruption, security, economy and employment. “Right now, insecurity at it’s peak, economy in shambles, corruption is monumental, unemployment maximal. “Worst government ever, may God never let us see this kind again.”

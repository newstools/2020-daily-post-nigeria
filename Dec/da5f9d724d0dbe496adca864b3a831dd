Femi Falana, a popular activist, has cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari against embarrassing himself by turning down the invitation to address the National Assembly over issues of insecurity plaguing the country. Falana issued the caution while faulting the remarks by Abubakar Malami, Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, that the National Assembly has no right to summon Buhari. Malami had explained that security issue was on the exclusive list of the Executive, hence the National Assembly has right to summon the President on such. Buhari was scheduled to appear before the lawmakers on Thursday. Reacting to Malami’s claim, Falana insisted that the National Assembly has the power to summon the President. Falani, in a statement, said: “On his own part, the honourable Attorney-General of the federation has questioned the constitutional power of the National Assembly to invite the President on the grounds that as the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, he cannot be compelled to disclose operational details of the defence of the country. “With respect, the President is under a moral and legal obligation to honour the invitation. “Having accepted the invitation, the president should not allow himself to be embarrassed by turning round to turn down the invitation.”

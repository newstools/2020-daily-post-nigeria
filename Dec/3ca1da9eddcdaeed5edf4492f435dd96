The Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, says contrary to widespread belief, his principal is not a stingy man. Adesina claimed that Buhari, one time, gave him an envelope containing foreign currency and also sponsored his family on a trip to the South-East when he was given a chieftaincy title. The President’s spokesman revealed this in a tribute to Buhari on the occasion of his 78th birthday on Thursday. He wrote, “And in January 2017, I was to receive the traditional title of Nwanne di Namba of Mmaku Kingdom, in Enugu State. Courtesy demanded I tell the President. This man, who prides himself as ‘very stingy’ gave me a handsome amount of money to ferry my friends and family to the ceremony. How much? I won’t tell you, lest you ask for a belated share. “And in May 2018, I was billed for China for a 12-day course for senior government officials from Africa. He said when the journey was two days away, I should come to see him. I did. You know what he said? ‘Adesina, I know that you don’t have money. But you are too shy to ask.’ We both laughed, and he gave me an envelope which contained foreign currency. How much? You think I’ll tell you? For where?”

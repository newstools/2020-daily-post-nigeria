Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has revealed how his team can win this season’s La Liga title ahead of Real Madrid, Atletico Madrid and others. According to Koeman, Barcelona must improve their effectiveness in front of goal and have more confidence to win the Spanish top-flight league title this term. Koeman’s men are currently in the eighth position on the La Liga table after eleven matches with 9 points behind leaders Real Sociedad. Last season, Real Madrid won the La Liga title ahead of Barcelona and others. Speaking after Barcelona’s 1-0 La Liga victory against Levante on Sunday, Koeman at his post-match press conference said, “Of course we can win [the La Liga title]. “If we improve and we have more confidence, and we improve our effectiveness [in front of goal], there’s a chance. “There are still lots of games left remaining. We know our situation in the league. “We knew after we lost against Cadiz we had to win and let’s hope that is good for the confidence.”

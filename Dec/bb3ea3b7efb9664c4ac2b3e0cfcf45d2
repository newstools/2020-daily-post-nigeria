The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has disclosed that its members are in consultation over the proposal the federal government made to them. ASUU National President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi said members are making consultations regarding their next line of action. Ogunyemi explained that the consultation would go beyond this week. Following a series of meetings between ASUU leadership and the federal government, the Labour Minister, Chris Ngige had promised that government would pay all withheld salaries of lecturers. The Federal government also pledged to release N75 billion for the revitalisation of universities and the payment of Earned Academic Allowances. However, Ogunyemi told Vanguard: “We have what the government is offering and have transmitted the same to our members nationwide, and we are consulting on what the next line of action will be. “As for how long the consultation would take, I cannot say, but it may go beyond this week. Whatever we decide on is going to be in the national interest, the interest of our children, the interest of our members and the good of all.”

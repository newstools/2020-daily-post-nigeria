Former President of the Senate, David Mark, has described the death of former Minister of Defence, Gen. Domkat Bali, as a loss to the country. Gen. Bali died on December 4 at the age of 80 years. Mark, in a statement issued to newsmen on Monday by his Media Aide, Paul Mumeh, also described Bali as a patriotic soldier who stood to be counted when it mattered. He said that Bali demonstrated statesmanship and loyalty to his fatherland during his lifetime. “This is one death too many. Gen. Bali was one of the best and fertile minds ever produced by the Nigerian Army. He remained until his death one of the finest and respected soldiers. “He left a legacy of high professionalism, discipline and integrity. He earned his respect and was loyal to authority and country. He was a man of honour,” he said. The former president of the senate lamented that Gen. Bali died at a time when his wealth of experience and knowledge was needed to navigate through the challenging political and security situations in Nigeria. He said Bali would be missed because of his unique personality, professionalism, discipline and contribution to national development.

Aston Villa’s assistant manager, John Terry, has criticised Chelsea defender, Andreas Christensen following his side’s 1-1 draw with the Blues in the Premier League on Monday night. Goals from Olivier Giroud and Anwar El Ghazi gave both Chelsea and Aston Villa a point each at Stamford Bridge. After the game, a fan told Terry on Instagram that he should be “raging” with Aston Villa’s equaliser following their refusal to put the ball out of play while Christensen appeared to be injured on the floor. But Terry, who spent thirteen years as Chelsea’s captain during his time at the West London club, said Christensen should have got back in position to defend Aston Villa’s attack. He [Christensen] should have got up,” Terry said. He added, “Great to be back at the Bridge tonight. Another great performance in the space of 48 hours from the boys @avfcofficial. Rest and recover now for the next game.” Meanwhile, Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has since insisted that Chelsea should not have been awarded a foul for Jack Grealish’s collision with Christensen. Lampard said, “In terms of the Grealish incident, I haven’t seen it again, but I didn’t feel there was much in it at the time, I am not sure whether it was a foul or not. “I was just concerned as soon as Andreas stayed down that the ball was going to go into our box and we would be a man down, which turned out to be the case.”

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has hit out at his ‘lazy’ Chelsea players, after they lost 3-1 to Arsenal on Boxing Day. The Gunners were 15th before the game, while the Blues could have gone second with a win. But Lampard’s men were 3-0 down after 56 minutes, thanks to goals from Alexandre Lacazette, Granit Xhaka and Bukayo Saka. Lampard, speaking to the media after the game, accused his players of not wanting to run or put the required amount of effort in from the start. “I’m angry because I want to win games. Today was an opportunity to go to a place where they’re having a tough time but you know how that goes. “You either make it more difficult for them or you give them a little opening. We did that from minute one and then we continued to do it for 45 minutes and then you get what you deserve. “Lazy giving away a penalty, and a free-kick, I’m very disappointed with way we approached first half,” Lampard said.

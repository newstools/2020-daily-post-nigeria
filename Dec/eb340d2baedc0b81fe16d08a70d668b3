Liverpool winger, Mohammed Salah, has equalled Cristiano Ronaldo’s total number of goals during his Manchester United days. Salah opened scoring on Sunday, as the Reds beat Wolves 4-0 at Anfield. It was his 84th strike in the Premier League and the Egyptian needs just 131 matches, 65 less than Ronaldo did, to hit the mark. The win took the Reds to 24 points from 11 fixtures, the same number as Spurs who defeated Arsenal 2-0 earlier in the day. Georginio Wijnaldum made it 2-0 after the break, before Joel Matip added a third. A Nelson Semedo own goal in the 78th minute completed the rout. The occasion also marked a return to Anfield for Liverpool’s supporters.

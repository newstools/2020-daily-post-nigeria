Napoli manager, Gennaro Gattuso, has revealed Victor Osimhen was ‘mad’ after he missed their Europa League trip to AZ Alkmaar. The 21-year-old suffered a dislocated shoulder during Nigeria’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifying fixture against Sierra Leone on November 13. Osimhen has now missed his Italian club’s last three matches across all competitions. The Parthenopeans flew out of Naples on Wednesday for the Alkmaar game and Gattuso has spoken about how Osimhen felt after he was dropped from his 20-man travelling squad. “It bothers me to see him mad and not smiling,” Gattuso said, as per Gianluca Di Marzio. “He is upset and that is normal. We must ease him back in, we hope he will heal as quickly as possible.” Osimhen has scored two goals in six Serie A matches since he arrived from Lille in the summer.

The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) has applied to withdraw its lawsuit filed to stop judicial panels probing allegations of brutality by its officials particularly operatives of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS. The suit marked: FHC/ABJ/CS/1492/2020 was filed on November 9, 2020, by the NPF, through its lawyer, O. M. Atoyebi (SAN), asking the Federal High Court in Abuja to stop the judicial proceedings. However, the NPF filed a notice of discontinuance on Friday by a lawyer to the NPF, Festus Ibude. The notice read, “Take notice that the plaintiff herein intends to and doth hereby wholly withdraws its suit against all the defendants.” The police came under heavy criticism during the week for attempting to stop the investigations. This led to the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, directing the immediate investigation into the lawsuit.

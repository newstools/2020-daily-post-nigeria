President Muhammadu Buhari will meet with members of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 today. The Presidency announced this on Tuesday via its official handle. “@MBuhari will meet with the Presidential Task Force on Covid-19 this afternoon,” @NGRPresident tweeted. This comes less than 24 hours after the federal government announced a partial shutdown for the next five weeks, in a bid to stem the second wave of Coronavirus across the country. The PTF Chairman, Boss Mustapha, issued the advisory on Monday at the PTF briefing in Abuja. According to Mustapha, Buhari had authorised the Presidential Task Force to engage with the states and the Federal Capital Territory to assume full ownership of this stage of the response. He said that bars, night clubs, pubs and event centres, and recreational venues were considered super-spreaders of the virus. States and the FCT are to shut down all informal and formal festivity events including weddings, conferences, congresses, office parties, concerts, seminars, sporting activities. Churches and Mosques should not be filled beyond 50 per cent of their installed capacity during worship and prayer time while face masks and social distancing are compulsory.

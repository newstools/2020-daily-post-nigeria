Chelsea will aim to record a back to back win when they travel to the Emirates Stadium on Boxing Day to play host Arsenal in one of the Premier League games slated in the festive period. The Blues come into the London derby after their 3-0 triumph over West Ham United on Monday night. Lampard and his men consequently moved into the fifth position in the Premier League standings. Chelsea are 6 points adrift of League Leaders Liverpool after 14 round of matches, and would be hoping to claim an away win before Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool take to the pitch on Sunday. Here, DAILY POST takes a look at how Chelsea could line-up against Arsenal. Absent; Hakim Ziyech (hamstring) Possible; Ben Chilwell (ankle), Reece James (knee) The Blues will play without the services of Hakim Ziyech due to his hamstring issue but first-choice right-back, Reece James and left-back Ben Chilwell are both probable for this match. The full back pair may not return in time for this clash. And it could see Captain Cesar Azpilicueta and Emerson Palmieri coming in for them at the full-back positions. Lampard is expected to keep the midfield three that featured against West Ham United. The midfield three would comprise of N’Golo Kante, Jorginho and corner-kick specialist Mason Mount. Timo Werner has only scored four times only this season but he could once again start on the wings (left). While Tammy Abraham’s pair of goals in the Monday fixture against West Ham should give the English star the nod to spearhead Chelsea’s attack. Hakim Ziyech’s no show for this match should see American star Christian Pulisic get the nod on their right while Callum Hudson-Odoi is expected to remain on the Chelsea bench in company of Olivier Giroud and out of form playmaker, Kai Havertz. Chelsea’s Predicted Line-Up Against Arsenal In A 4-3-3 Set-up. Edouard Mendy; Cesar Azpilicueta; Kurt Zouma, Thiago Silva, Emerson Palmieri; Jorginho, N’Golo Kante, Mason Mount; Christian Pulisic, Tammy Abraham, Timo Werner.

The Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong, has said that the state will at the right time, immortalise the memories of late retired Gen. Domkat Bali, a former Chief of Defence Staff, because of his contribution to the nation. Lalong disclosed this on Monday in Jos at the funeral service of Bali, who died on December 5, at the age of 80. He said the late Bali was passionate about his calling as a soldier and did his work with diligence rising to the very top as a four-star general. The governor said, “Today we are here to pay our last respect to a worthy son of Plateau and a patriotic Nigerian, who lived purposely. He led by example and left good examples that had continued to inspire others. “He brought pride to Plateau, even during the difficult times of our state General Bali worked behind the scene and gave useful pieces of advice and proffer solutions. “He worked for peace and encouraged diversity, tolerance and peaceful coexistence. Although he’s gone to remain with his maker, his legacies will live with us for a long time. “At the appropriate time as a state, we will “do the needful” to keep his memory alive. We also appeal to the Federal Government to do the same.” On his part, the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Gabriel Olonisakin described Bali as a distinguished gentleman, a soldier and an officer. Olonisakin said Bali’s demise was a great loss not only to the armed forces of Nigeria where he rose to the rank of a general and minister of defence but also his community and state. “We are here to celebrate the great legacies of Gen. Bali. We appreciate all those who came from far and near to honour the general,” he said.

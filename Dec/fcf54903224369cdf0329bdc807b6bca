The Executive Chairman of the Ekiti State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Prof. Femi Akinwumi has attributed the remarkable increase in the enrollment figures of public primary and Junior Secondary Schools in the state to the ongoing reforms in the basic education sector in the state. The SUBEB chairman who made the assertion in Ado-Ekiti while playing host to a monitoring team from the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC), said the enrollment figures of public schools had increased in the last couple of months leading to the establishment of an additional model secondary school, apart from the four new ones established at the beginning of the present academic session. Akinwumi highlighted the reforms to include the issuance of Executive Order 001 of 2018 which outlawed the payment of all fees and levies in all public primary and secondary schools, introduction of child friendly initiatives in primary schools, the payment of over N7.5 billion counterpart funds to UBEC which facilitated over 750 UBEC/SUBEB intervention projects for 2016, 2017 and 2018 as well as the 2019 intervention currently undergoing processing. He also listed ongoing projects in basic education sector in the state to include the construction of new classrooms and perimeter fences of schools, renovation of classroom blocks, procurement of tens of thousands modern plastic pupils furniture and teachers furniture which had greatly improved teaching and learning environment in public schools in the state. Pledging the continued collaboration of the state with UBEC, the SUBEB boss assured that his board would provide the monitoring team with the required logistics to succeed in its assignment. Earlier in his remarks, the head of the UBEC team, Mr Edward Abalaka said the visiting team was one of 37 teams set up by UBEC to monitor ongoing UBEC/SUBEB projects in the 36 states of the federation and the FCT. He said the focus is to ensure value for money spent and ultimately improve the basic education sector.

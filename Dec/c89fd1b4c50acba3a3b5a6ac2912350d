Governor Nasir El-rufai, has expressed concern over the rising cases of COVID-19 infections in the state and threatened to impose a second lockdown in the entire State if the rate of infections continues to rise. El-Rufai said that he was worried that the rate of infections will soon overwhelm the stateâ€™s health system if nothing is done urgently to contain the spread of the virus. Kaduna State has so far recorded 30 percent new COVID-19 infections daily in the last two months. The Governor lamented that some residents have refused to abide by all the safety measures put in place by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). He hinted that if the present trend continues, there might be another lockdown soon. The Governor directed that all employees of the state government must undergo a mandatory COVID-19 test as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus in the state. Ahead of the Christmas festivities, the Governor warned residents to celebrate with caution, by avoiding large gatherings, wearing their face masks always, and adhering to other safety measures that would prevent them from contracting COVID-19 during and after the festivities.

Former Arsenal forward, Robin van Persie, has revealed he told Gunners’ former boss, Arsene Wenger to sign defender Giorgio Chiellini for the club. The Dutchman said he felt the North London side “lacked a winning mentality.” According to Persie, he left Arsenal for Manchester United because “I wanted to win, I just wanted to win. And I had to take a risk for that.” Persie spent eight years at Arsenal but failed to secure a Premier League title with the club and felt Chiellini would have transformed the club. He pleaded with Wenger to make the deal, but the French boss didn’t make the move as Chiellini is now in his 15th year at Juventus. “At a given moment I felt called upon to say what Arsenal could do better in order to win the league,” he said in an interview on Kaj Gorgels’ YouTube channel. “I felt we lacked a winning mentality, and asked Arsene Wenger to sign Giorgio Chiellini. “I have played against him a few times, and he is a genuine winner,” Van Persie said. “You could see that when he played against Holland a few weeks ago. “He is 36 years old, but he’ll dish out nine elbows every game with a smile on his face. He’ll keep smiling and never get a yellow card. “You need those types of winners and killers on your side. I felt we should get him. “I came up with suggestions and names on the basis of my own experience,” he added. “We were very good up front, and scored lots of goals. But your goalkeeper and your defence are the basis of your team. “To my mind ours were not at the level needed to truly compete for the title.”Van Persie

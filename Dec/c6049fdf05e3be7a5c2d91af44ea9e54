Manager, Frank Lampard has blamed his Chelsea players for their 2-1 defeat to Wolves in the Premier League on Tuesday night. He said the Blues lost to Everton on Saturday and to Wolves on Tuesday because they were being carried away, thinking that they were playing well. Wolves’ Pedro Neto broke clear, scoring in the 95th minute to give the home side all three points. Chelsea have now suffered a back-to-back loss for the first time during Lampard’s reign after weekend’s 1-0 loss to Everton. “Performance is what gives you results. We were playing very well, on a long unbeaten run and then maybe the lads think ‘we’re playing well’,” Lampard told a post-match press conference. “The minute you think you’re playing well, things like this can happen. “If you’re not playing well which we weren’t tonight, hang on to the 1-0. Play, control the game, and don’t allow counter attacks like we did.” Lampard’s men remain in fifth on the Premier League log, three points behind Tottenham and Liverpool.

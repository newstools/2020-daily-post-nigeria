Arsenal have added Norwich midfielder, Emiliano Buendia, to their list of targets, according to TeamTalk. Gunners boss, Mikel Arteta, has exiled Mesut Ozil from his squad, leaving him short of creativity in midfield. Even before dumping Ozil, Arteta was on the lookout for midfield signings in the summer. The Spaniard brought in Thomas Partey from Atletico Madrid, but also wanted Lyonâ€™s Houssem Aouar. Arsenal were unable to complete a deal for Aouar, though. But they continue to be linked with him ahead of the January window. However, Aouar has recently hinted he is happy at the Ligue 1 club and is likely to see out the rest of the season at least, leaving Arsenal to turn their attention elsewhere. Another major target to emerge has been RB Salzburg star Dominik Szoboszlai.

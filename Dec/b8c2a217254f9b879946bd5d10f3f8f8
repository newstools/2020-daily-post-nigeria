Uganda has ordered 9 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. In a statement on Thursday, the country’s Ministry of Health said the shots would cover 20 percent of the 45 million population. “Plans are underway to secure additional doses of the vaccine to cover more people”, it said. On Tuesday, Uganda announced that it had applied through the GAVI Alliance to secure the vaccine from AstraZeneca. The government is worried about rising cases of coronavirus, Xinhua reports. The country registered 1,199 new cases on Wednesday, the highest ever in one day since the index case on March 21. Uganda has recorded 25,059 infections, 9,510 recoveries and 219 deaths. However, Nigeria has remained silent on vaccine purchase. The federal government is yet to state an official position amid fears of a second wave of infections. Nigeria has recorded more than 70,669 cases of COVID-19 and 1,184 deaths since the index case on February 27.

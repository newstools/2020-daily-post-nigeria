The Lagos State Police Command has debunked a viral video suggesting that there is an ongoing End SARS protest in the state on Monday. DAILY POST reports that some social media users posted the video on Twitter, claiming that protesters have returned to the Lekki Toll Gate despite the heavy presence of the police and other security agents. But, the Lagos police spokesman, Muyiwa Adejobi said this was not true. According to Adejobi, the video being circulated was shot before the toll gate was set on fire, after the Lekki shooting incident of October 20. In a tweet on Monday afternoon, Adejobi said, “The attention of the Lagos State police command has been drawn to this viral video that some youths staged a protest at Lekki tollgate today 7th Dec 2020. It’s not true. This was a very old video before the tollgate was set ablaze. PPRO Lagos.”

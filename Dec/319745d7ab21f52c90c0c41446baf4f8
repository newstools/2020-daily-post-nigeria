The Nigerian Government has extended the deadline to connect National Identification Number (NIN) with their SIM cards registration records. The new deadline is now January 19, 2021 for those with NIN. For those without NIN, the deadline has been extended to February 9, 2021. This is coming at a time when the government was criticised for issuing two weeks to Nigerians to update Sim registration. Recall that the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) had told telecommunications companies to block all unregistered SIM cards in the country in two weeks. Customers of all networks were told to register with their National Identity Numbers (NIN) or risk losing their numbers.

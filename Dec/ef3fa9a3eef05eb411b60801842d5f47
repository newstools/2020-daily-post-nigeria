Letep Dabang, an All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain, has said the dissolution of structures in states was not well-received by some members. He said he believed the development was for the progress of the party. The National Executive Committee (NEC) gave the order on Tuesday at a meeting held at the State House, Abuja. Dabang, the immediate past chairman of the APC in Plateau State, appealed to all stakeholders to be patient. He admitted that the decision had infuriated some of his ex-colleagues. Dabang disclosed that the grouse of the former state chairmen was that they were duly elected and had not completed their tenure. He, however, stressed that the NEC decision was not targeted at individuals. “If the decision of the majority of NEC members is that the structures be dissolved, so be it. It is not a traditional title that you hold unto as an inheritance. Let some other people come in let us see the changes that will come”, NAN quoted him as saying.

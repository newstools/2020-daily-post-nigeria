The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, on Wednesday called off its industrial action. ASUU Chairman, Professor Biodun Ogunyemi disclosed this during a press briefing on Wednesday, after the union’s ongoing negotiation with the Federal Government. Recall that ASUU had been on strike for about nine months. The prolonged strike was due to government’s alleged delay in meeting the agreements reached with the union. ASUU had commenced the current strike in March, 2019. “We are going back to strive for our students to excel. We are returning to classes and appeal to parents to work with us for the revitalization of universities,” the ASUU Chairman said.

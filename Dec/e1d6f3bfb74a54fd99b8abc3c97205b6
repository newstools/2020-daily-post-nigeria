An Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurse in the United States has tested positive for COVID-19, after taking Pfizer Inc. vaccine shot on December 18. Matthew W., 45, spoke to ABC News San Diego affiliate KGTV. The health worker recalled that after receiving the jab, he only experienced arm soreness. Six days later, after working a shift in the COVID-19 unit, Matthew said he had muscle pain and fatigue. A coronavirus test confirmed his positive status, ANI News reports. Dr. Christian Ramers of the Family Health Centre of San Diego allayed fears about the situation. The infectious disease expert said it was already established from clinical trials that it would take 10 to 14 days for vaccine recipients to develop protection. “That first dose we think gives you somewhere around 50 percent and you need that second dose to get up to 95 per cent,” Ramers told KGTV. He added that it was possible that the nurse contracted the virus COVID-19 before the vaccination.

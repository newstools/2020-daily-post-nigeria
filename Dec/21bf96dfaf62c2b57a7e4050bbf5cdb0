Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, has become the youngest player in Champions League history to reach 20 goals. Mbappe breaks a record previously held by Barcelona’s Lionel Messi. The France international scored twice as PSG hammered Istanbul Basaksehir 5-1 in a rescheduled Champions League game on Wednesday. Mbappe scored from the penalty spot in the 42nd minute to make it 3-0 after Neymar got a brace. At 21 years and 355 days, Mbappe becomes the youngest player to reach 20 career goals in the competition, with Messi previously holding the record at 22 years and 266 days. The top five include Raul, Alessandro Del Piero and Karim Benzema. Mbappe’s record came just days after he reached another career milestone, scoring his 100th goal for PSG with his strike against Montpellier.

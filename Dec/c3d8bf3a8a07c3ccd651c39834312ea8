A former governor of Bauchi State, Isa Yuguda, has said that an Igbo presidency will strengthen Nigeria. Ahead of the next general election in 2023, certain groups and individuals have been asking that the South-East produce the next president. Disagreeing with the calls for restructuring, Yuguda, speaking with The Sun, stressed that the Southeast be allowed to take a shot at the presidency. “The east should be given a shot for the presidency, but should not be seen as a right, but comfort in the minds of our brothers and sisters. That as a region, they have had it too. “If north-south is flying for now, why not north-west and east fly? If that will strengthen our unity and faith in our country, why can’t we have it? Igbo presidency will strengthen our country. “No region will be better off in the event of restructuring because of the uniqueness of Nigeria. Let’s strive to have patriotic and God-fearing leadership that will place Nigeria on the path of sustainable growth and development,” he said.

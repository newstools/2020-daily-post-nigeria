Youth groups have described as a healthy development in the nation’s political history, the emergence of Women Vice-Chairpersons of Local Government Councils in the just concluded local government election in Kogi State. The Chairmen and Vice-Chairpersons who won elections in the 21 Local Government Areas were on Monday inaugurated by the State Governor, Yahaya Bello. In a statement by the Nigerian Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), sent to DAILY POST, the National President, Sokubo Sara-Igbe, said the appointment of youths at the local governments as Secretaries of Councils has further deepened inclusiveness in governance in Kogi State. The statement said: “As you are all aware, Governor Yahaya Bello had during the inauguration of the newly elected Local government leaders announced the appointment of the NYCN chairmen of the various local governments in the state, as the Secretaries to the Local governments across the state. “This is a kind of inclusiveness that has not happened anywhere in Nigeria, in this manner and if this approach to governance in Kogi State is replicated in other states, it would change the ugly narrative in governance. “With this development, notable Nigerians, Kogites and non-Kogites, including opposition parties have commended the state Governor, because these appointments are a major victory in bridging the age-long gap that has existed between Nigerian youth and government at various levels in the country. The group pointed out that the much desired 35% women participation in politics was being realised while urging the beneficiaries of appointments at various levels to be good ambassadors. According to the group, the governor’s support that saw the emergence of a physically challenged as an elected Councillor in his own ward in Okene local government was further a pointer to inclusiveness in politics.

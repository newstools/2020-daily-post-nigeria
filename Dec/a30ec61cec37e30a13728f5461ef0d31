Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has expressed his concern about the club’s crunch Champions League tie against RB Leipzig. United only need a draw to be assured of qualification for the Round of 16. Although Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men smashed five past Leipzig at home in October, Berbatov feels the return leg will be a different affair entirely. “I am confident and I believe United can still qualify with a result against RB Leipzig,” he told Betfair. “Looking at the match, I am a bit worried because Leipzig are a good team and I don’t think anyone thinks otherwise, they are going to cause problems for United. “Even though last time out United won 5-0 don’t let that fool you, every game is different, and Leipzig will push with everything they have to qualify.”

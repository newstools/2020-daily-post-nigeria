Arsenalâ€™s board have decided to back manager Mikel Arteta in the January transfer market, amid fears the club will be caught up into a relegation battle, Daily Mail reports. But the underfire Arteta has another problem on his hands, as it has emerged that there is disquiet from members of his squad. After an encouraging 1-1 draw against Southampton in midweek, the pressure on the Spaniard intensified after the Gunners lost 2-1 at Everton. In the short-term, the Arsenal hierarchy are unequivocally backing Arteta despite their alarming slide down the table. Funds will be made available for him to strengthen the team when the transfer window re-opens, with a creative midfielder a priority for the Gunners. However, before then, Arteta has to start getting results, starting with a Carabao Cup clash with Manchester City on Tuesday. Arsenal will then clash with Chelsea on Boxing Day.

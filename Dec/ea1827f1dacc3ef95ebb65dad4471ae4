Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has suspended his Chief of Staff, Anthony Agbazuere. Chris Ezem, Secretary to the State Government, made the announcement in a statement on Sunday. The suspension takes immediate effect. No reason was given. Ezem said the Permanent Secretary, Government House, Alozie Odoemelam, will assume the Chief of Staff position until further notice. Last Wednesday when Ikpeazu approved payment of Consolidated Health Salary Scheme (CONHESS) for local government workers, Agbazuere signed the statement. He said the governor has also directed the resolution of arrears of salaries owed by some government parastatals. “It is also the position of government that workers will be paid by hand to checkmate debilitating and illicit sharp practices. “It is expected that health workers and others will reciprocate this goodwill of the Governor by putting in their best in the service of our State”, Agbazuere noted.

Alhassan Ado Doguwa, to punish him for calling for an impeachment process against the President ridicules the House of Representatives. “We are talking with our colleagues. We are talking to Nigerians. We are also asking Nigerians to talk to their representatives. “It is not what you want. If the people that the House leader represents in Kano come together and tell him (Doguwa) we want you to sign this impeachment notice, we are in support. He has no right to do otherwise. “I owe nobody any apology for calling for the impeachment of Mr. President,” Chinda said.

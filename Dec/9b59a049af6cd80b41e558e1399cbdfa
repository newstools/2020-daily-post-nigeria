Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has refused to blame Serge Aurier for a penalty he conceded in their 2-0 loss to Leicester City in the Premier League on Sunday. Aurier conceded a penalty in the first half when he fouled Wesley Fofana in the box. In the Amazon documentary ‘Spurs All or Nothing’, Mourinho was caught on camera telling the Ivorian defender, that he was scared of him giving away a “sh*t penalty with VAR”. He however labelled the one Aurier gave away today as a “mistake”. “It was a mistake, not a moment of madness. I have to admit, you have to know where you are when you’re in the box. “You have to know that the player was going away from goal without any kind of danger. You have to describe it as a mistake,” Mourinho told Sky Sports.

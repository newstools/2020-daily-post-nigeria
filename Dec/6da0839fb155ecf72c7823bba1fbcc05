On how he met the actress and got married to her, the former House of Reps member, said, “I met her and I liked her. We got married within three weeks. I married all my wives within the same period.

They came to look around and I liked her and that was it.” Mr. Nwoko, who was born Chinedu Munir Nwoko on December 21, 1960, is also a lawyer and humanitarian.

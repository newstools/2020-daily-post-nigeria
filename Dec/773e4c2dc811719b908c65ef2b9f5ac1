Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has urged the military to restrategize in the war against Boko Haram. Tinubu said the war against Boko Haram was tactical, hence the need to replan and change strategies. He spoke during a condolence visit to the Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum in Maiduguri, following Boko Haram’s killing of farmers in the state. The former governor of Lagos State warned that the fight against Boko Haram was no longer a conventional one. According to Tinubu: “We have been on this (Boko Haram) for some time, We have seen the reaction of the federal government, we have seen the reaction of the armed forces, this is no longer conventional warfare. “This is more tactical, more reason, more crude. In such a situation what we do is to replan our strategy.” Boko Haram insurgents had recently killed several rice farmers in Zabarmari area of Borno State. The terrorist group had beheaded the farmers for allegedly informing the military about their operations.

The National Rebirth Movement, NRM, has said coup plotters and agents of destabilization are conspiring against Nigeria and the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. NRM explained that these agents of darkness against Buhari want Nigeria to disintegrate into chaos. The group stated this following the Boko Haram massacre of rice farmers in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State. A statement by Augustine Richard Adie, NRM’s National Coordinator during a grand rally for President Muhammadu Buhari and the Nigerian State, insisted that the game plan of these agents of destabilization was to discredit Buhari before Nigerians and the International community. Adie alleged that the plot was to portray Buhari as an incompetent president while demanding a change of government through unorthodox means. According to Adie: “This rally is also against coup plotters, agents of destabilization and foreign elements conspiring against Nigeria and the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari, for we know that they desire that Nigeria disintegrates into chaos. But they won’t have their way for Nigerians are resolute to protect the country from these marauders. “We know their ultimate game plan is to discredit the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari before Nigerians and the international community. They want to paint a picture of incompetence as a justification for their evil desire for a change of government through unorthodox means such as the fuelling of violence across the country.”

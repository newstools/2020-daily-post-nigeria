The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has urged the abductors of the Auxiliary Catholic Bishop of Owerri, Bishop Moses Chikwe, to release him unhurt and without ransom. CAN made the call in a statement signed by its state Chairman, Rev. Eches Divine-Eches on Tuesday in Owerri. Divine-Eches said the bishop’s abduction came as a rude shock to them describing the incident as a “desecration of the Altar of God.” According to him, the bishop was a peaceful man who discharged his duties without malice and wondered why he was targeted. Recall that kidnappers had whisked away Chikwe in Owerri. His car and official regalia were later found near the Assumpta Cathedral in Owerri. “Imo State chapter of CAN has received with shock the news of the kidnap of the Auxiliary Catholic Bishop of Owerri, Rt. Rev. Moses Chikwe and condemn the act vehemently. “Rt. Rev. Chikwe since his assumption as the Auxiliary Catholic Bishop of Owerri has discharged his duties quietly and without malice, which leaves one wondering why he’s a target of kidnap. “This is a desecration of the altar of God, and we call on the perpetrators to release him immediately, unhurt and without ransom,” Divine-Eches said. Divine-Eches appealed to the Police Commissioner in Imo to ensure the perpetrators were caught and made to pay for the act. He called on youths of the state to shun crime and avoid being used to perpetrate evil while urging all Christian faithful to pray for the swift release of the bishop. “The entire Christian community in Imo calls on the Commissioner of Police to ensure the perpetrators of this act of wickedness are fished out to face the music. “We appeal to our teeming youths not to allow themselves to be used by the devil to wreak havoc and fear in our beautiful state.”

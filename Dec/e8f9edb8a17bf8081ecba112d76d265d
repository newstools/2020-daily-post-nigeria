This is coming a day after gunmen killed two senior police officers and injured one other after they attempt to rescue some kidnapped victims. State police spokesman, SP. Abdu Jinjiri confirmed this to DAILY POST. “We received a report from relative of the victim that Habashiya has been kidnapped and her one-month-old baby abandoned.” He said the case is under investigation and efforts are on to rescue the victims. Jinjiri, however, advised relatives of kidnapped victims to report such cases to the police on time.

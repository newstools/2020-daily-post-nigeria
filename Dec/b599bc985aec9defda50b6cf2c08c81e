The Osun State government, on Tuesday, gave new guidelines concerning cross over night church services across the State. It decided to allow cross over religious gatherings. DAILY POST reported that the State government last week insisted that it has placed ban on countdown to new year ceremonies or cross over services in the State due to COVID-19. It has now made u-turn on its earlier order. According to the Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode, in a statement, this was due to “sensitive mood of the season.” According to the new guideline, any organisation holding cross over service must close the service early and “everyone must be off the streets by 1:00am.” Egbemode further said, “Security operatives have been given the directive to enforce this guideline. Religious bodies and citizens are therefore advised to comply because we do not want anyone to spend the first day of the year in police custody. “Also, the leadership of religious bodies must ensure strict adherence to safety protocols, which include accommodating only 50 percent capacity of their normal attendance, ensuring social distancing, use of nose mask or face fields by participants, avoidance of sharing materials and instruments and avoidance of any other action that can help the virus to spread. “The government wishes everyone a prosperous year ahead, but wants all of us to do what is right to keep the peace, safety and health of the State and its citizens.”

Barcelona winger, Ousmane Dembele, has emerged as a doubt for their Champions League clash with Juventus after suffering a hamstring injury. Dembele came on as a substitute during Barca’s shock 2-1 defeat to Cadiz on Saturday. The Frenchman was introduced after the break with the Catalans already 1-0 down to an Alvaro Gimenez effort. Koeman’s men got the equalizer through Jordi Alba, but Alvaro Negredo netted the winner for the hosts. Although Dembele played the entire game, Barca have now revealed that he picked up a knock. “Tests on Sunday morning, December 6, have shown that first-team player Ousmane Dembele has a hamstring elongation,” a statement on the club’s official website read. “He will therefore not be considered for selection and the evolution of the injury will determine his availability.”

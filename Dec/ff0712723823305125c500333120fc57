More than 70 personnel of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) are currently in China on a special training. They have been in the Asian country for four months and will return next week. The contingent will be deployed to activate the 203 Combat Reconnaissance NAF Base in Gombe State. The Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, made the disclosure on Tuesday when he visited Governor Inuwa Yahaya. Abubakar stressed that the NAF Base in the state was strategic in the fight against insurgency, banditry and other criminal activities in the north. “We are very excited that we are going to have this unit activated”, the CAS said. He noted that additional Special Forces units would be stationed to protect NAF assets. Abubakar assured that the military arm, in collaboration with other services, would continue to protect Nigeria’s territorial integrity and national sovereignty

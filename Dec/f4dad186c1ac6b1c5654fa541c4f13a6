Nuno Espirito Santo, Wolves manager, has revealed why his side overwhelmed Chelsea on Tuesday. Wolves gave Chelsea their first back to back defeat under Frank Lampard on Tuesday. Chelsea’s hope of bouncing back from their weekend defeat to Everton at Goodison Park was dashed after Pedro Neto broke clear, scoring in the 95th minute to give the home side all three points. Daniel Podence had cancelled Olivier Giroud earlier strike for Chelsea with the game heading for a draw. But Pedro waited until the last minute of the added time to break the visitors’ heart. And manager Santo believes his team worked very hard to earn themselves the three points. “We reacted well,” Nuno Santo told the press after the match. “I think we were always in the game. We were well organised and second-half we played really well.”

Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted some of the Premier League matches that will be played on Saturday. The early kick off will see leaders Liverpool travel to take on Crystal Palace. “I will go for the obvious one here and say Liverpool will win. Prediction 3-1,” Berbatov told BetFair. Southampton host former champions Manchester City in the second fixture of the day. “Something isn’t quite right for City football-wise and I think they’re going to have a tough time in this match, or they could surprise us and bounce back. Prediction 1-1,” he said. Arsenal then take on an in-form Everton side at Goodison Park. “I think the crisis will get a bit worse for Arsenal before it gets better and I think Everton will be in the mood to go for Arsenal in this one. Prediction 2-0,” Berbatov added.

The Nigerian Defence Headquarters, DHQ, has refuted claims that Fulani socio-cultural organisation, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association, MACBAN, effected the release of the abducted Government Science Secondary School in Kankara, Katsina State. John Enenche, spokesman of DHQ said the military rescued the students and not MACBAN members as claimed. Enenche’s remark contradicts claim of Bello Matawalle, Governor of Zamfara, who said MACBAN negotiated the release of the students. In a statement, Enenche disclosed that troops of Operation Hadarin Daji rescued the abducted students. Enenche also commended the public who “volunteered information are also appreciated”. “Keeping to its promise to ensure the safe return of all abducted students of Government Science Secondary School Kankara, Katsina State, troops of Operation HADARIN DAJI rescued all 344 abducted students on Thursday 17 December 2020. “The Military High Command commends troops of Operation Hadarin Daji including all security agencies for their dexterity,” Enenche said.

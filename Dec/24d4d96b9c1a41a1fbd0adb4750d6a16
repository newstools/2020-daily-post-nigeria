A former Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side to beat Leicester City on Boxing Day when both teams clash in the Premier League. Berbatov believes both Man United and Leicester will score but the Red Devils would secure all three points against the host at the King Power Stadium. Man United head to the game after beating Everton 2-0 in the Carabao Cup quarter-final encounter on Wednesday, while Leicester City defeated Tottenham 2-0 in the Premier League last Sunday. “It’s a massive game between second and third in the Premier League,” Berbatov told Betfair. “I can see both teams scoring but, if United start on the right foot, and don’t fall behind, then I think they will win this. “I want to see Ole smiling at full-time and United closing in on the top spot. Leicester City 1, Manchester United 2.” The kick-off time for Leicester vs Man United is 1:30 pm.

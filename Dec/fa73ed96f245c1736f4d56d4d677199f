Chelsea legend, Petr Cech has urged Arsenal board to support their manager, Mikel Arteta, ahead of both sides’s clash in the Premier League on Saturday. Cech, who played alongside Arteta at Arsenal, believes the Spaniard can still turn things around for the Gunners despite losing four out of their five last games. Arteta is under intense pressure at Arsenal following the club’s recent poor performances in the Premier League. Arteta’s side was also eliminated from the Carabao Cup after losing 4-1 against Manchester City on Wednesday night. The North London club are currently just four points above the relegation zone ahead of their Boxing Day clash against Frank Lampard’s side at Emirates Stadium. Speaking on the development, Cech told talkSPORT: “It’s hard for any manager when results don’t go your way, and then you try to change the way the team play or the philosophy of the football. “When you start to change a little bit, it needs time. As well to implement that faster you have to have everybody believe in it, you need some results as well. “As soon as you are on the football pitch knowing you have won three on the bounce you don’t worry less about what’s going to happen you just worry about your game, you just go on and suddenly you go ‘oh this works, that works’. “It’s a lot about confidence. At the moment when you hit the wall, this is the moment when you need everybody to pull in the same direction and help you out. “This is the hardest part in football because it’s easy to suddenly say this is not working and do something else, but you can’t do that all the time. “But of course in modern football, it’s the results that count, and at the end of the day you need to find your balance to have success and the way you do it.”

Nigerian singer, Ayo Balogun, also known as Wizkid has said he would have been a street hustler if he wasn’t making music. Speaking during an interview with the English model, Noami Campbell, the 30-year-old revealed that he feels God used music to change his life knowing that he wasn’t born with a silver spoon. “If I wasn’t blessed to be doing music I would have probably been on the streets. “I am not from a rich family and I wasn’t raised with a silver spoon so I feel I was blessed so I can be a blessing to my family and to those around me. “I believe if I wasn’t making music I would have been on the streets hustling like every other kid. ”God blessed me with music and it’s safe to say music changed my life. It also changed the life of those I love and care about,” he said.

The Northern Elders Forum (NEF) has condemned in strong terms, the attack by what they called “hired hoodlums” on a peaceful and legitimate meeting convened by Coalition of Northern Groups (CNG) to discuss appropriate responses to the outrageous abduction of schoolchildren in Katsina State. The Director, Publicity and Advocacy of the forum, Dr Hakeem Baba-Ahmed, in a statement, noted that the meeting was also being attended by older Nigerians who had given their entire lives to the service of the nation. The statement lamented, “This cowardly and crude attempt to muffle national outrage at increasingly deteriorating security of life and property in Nigeria will mark a new low in state of the nation.” It stated that Nigerians would note another threat that will increase the number of threats they are having to live with, or die under. The statement explained that even in the face of the threat, the organizers have their rights to legally organize and express opinions over the manner they live. The northern elders observed that whoever is behind the attack needs to know that more meetings will continue to be held all over Nigeria to demand that those with responsibility to secure us do so. “Nigerians will never submit to fear of criminals and the incompetence and indifference of elected leaders,” the statement explained. It said that those behind the attack should employ more hoodlums, assuring that voices would rise until the Kankara school children are freed and the siege on people’s lives is ended. The forum, therefore, called on the Coalition of Northern Groups to sustain their efforts through all legal means until the North is safe and secure again. It calls on all Nigerians to unite behind the demand for a secure nation, and exercise their rights to assemble and express opinions as the law allows.

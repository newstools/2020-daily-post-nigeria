Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has warned his players not to underestimate Champions League opponents Borussia Monchengladbach. City was drawn against the Bundesliga outfit in the Round of 16 on Monday. But Guardiola has said he is aware of Monchengladbach’s strength from his time in Germany. “I learned in Germany how big and important and historic they are. “It’s a club that I respect a lot, they have the beauty of playing football. “They went through a tough group and made an incredible couple of games against Shakhtar Donetsk after they’d beaten Real Madrid. “We have to arrive in the best condition possible. I’ve seen the highlights, not much of them properly, but we’ll start to work on it [nearer the time]. “But we know for the last 16 it’s about arriving in the best condition possible to go through,” Guardiola told a press conference.

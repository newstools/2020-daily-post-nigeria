Veteran Fuji artiste, Wasiu Ayinde, popularly known as Kwam1, has given reason he can never run for any political office. KWAM 1 who is the first Mayegun of Yoruba Land, speaking at an event, titled “FUJI-Opera”, held at Alliance Francaise, Mike Adenuga Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos, said his decision not to run for any political office was based on his hatred for “promise and fail” attitudes. According to him, he does not want to make hefty promises to gain votes only to fail the electorates due to unforeseen factors. Few months ago, KWAM 1 assaulted a broadcaster named Wole Sorunke in Ogun State, leading to calls for him to be stripped off his title. The Ogun broadcaster had accused Wasiu Ayinde and his ‘boys’ of beating him up at the 60th birthday party of the Olu of Itori, Oba Abdulfatai Akamo. The incident generated mixed-reactions, as the Freelance and Independent Broadcasters Association of Nigeria (FIBAN) ordered its members to stop playing Ayinde songs on their radio and television programmes. But, the issue was said to have been resolved at a meeting held at the palace of Olu Itori in Ewekoro Local Government area of Ogun State.

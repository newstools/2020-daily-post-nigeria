Bauchi State governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, on Sunday called on members of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and their supporters to accept the party’s defeat in Saturday’s state House of Assembly bye election in Dass constituency with dignity and spirit of sportsmanship. The governor, who described PDP’s loss of the election as the will of God, encouraged party faithful not to be divided by the temporary setback. According to a statement signed and made available to journalists in Bauchi by his media aide, Muktar Gidado, Governor Mohammed while observing that the loss is a lesson for all, noted that as warriors, both his government and PDP need to plan to regain their lost ground with chivalry, tactics and team work. “All praise and adoration belong to Allah. The loss of our party is a lesson for all of us, but no one is to be blamed. “Remember, we lost 21 House of Assembly seats and 3 Senate seats in 2019 but Allah gave us victory in the gubernatorial election. Let us not play to the gallery by indulging in blame game, internal rancor, accusations and mistrust,” Gidado quoted the governor to have said. Governor Mohammed, therefore, appreciated all the dogged PDP members for their support and contributions towards ensuring the success of his administration.

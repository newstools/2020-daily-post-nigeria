Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has given fitness updates on Hakim Ziyech, Reece James and Ben Chilwell ahead of their clash with Arsenal. The Blues will climb into the top four places if they pick up a second-successive victory against the Gunners. Lampard’s men bounced back from a two-match losing run by defeating West Ham at Stamford Bridge on Monday night. They will be hoping to continue their run, but will be without Ziyech. Asked if the 27-year-old will be available for selection against Arsenal, Lampard told a pre-match press conference: “No, he won’t be fit for Arsenal.” Lampard went on to confirm James and Chilwell are both doubts for the fixture and a meeting with Aston Villa on December 28. The former missed the West Ham game due to a knee issue, while the latter was withdrawn in the first half after turning his ankle. “They’re both doubtful. We’re not sure whether they will be fit for either game,” said Lampard.

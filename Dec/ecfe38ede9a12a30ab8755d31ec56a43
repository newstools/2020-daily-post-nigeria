Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has backed both Edinson Cavani and the Football Association, as the governing body looks into an Instagram post that was sent from the striker’s account. Cavani has already deleted the post and offered an apology. However, the FA has asked the Uruguay international for his observations and Solskjaer has backed both the governing body and his player over the incident. “We’ve communicated with Edinson and he’s deeply sorry for the mistake he made. There was no malicious intent at all, it was just an affectionate greeting to a friend of his. “We explained to him and he’s been asked by the FA to explain so of course he will cooperate with them and we will support him. It’s one of those unfortunate situations. He’s just come into the country, in Uruguay it’s used in a different way than what we have here. “We will support him but we support the FA too. It’s important that the FA has asked him to explain and it’s out there for everyone to see because we want to be in the fight against discrimination with everyone,” Solskjaer told a press conference on Tuesday. Cavani is now facing a three-match ban from domestic fixtures. The 33-year-old is, however, in contention to face his former side Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League on Wednesday night.

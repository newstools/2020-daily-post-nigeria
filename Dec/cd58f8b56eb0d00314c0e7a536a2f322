The fire, as it was gathered started around 11:30 pm on Tuesday from a shop and spread to other parts of the market. As at the time of this report, the cause of the incident is yet to be ascertained. It was gathered that the inferno was the third fire incident in the market in 2020. A source told our correspondent that late response from the fire service also contributed to the spread of the fire and caused more destruction.

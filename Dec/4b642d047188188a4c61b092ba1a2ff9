The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has given telecommunications operators in the country two weeks to block all SIM cards that are not registered with the National Identity Numbers (NIN). It warned that any telecom operators that failed to comply with the directive risked outright withdrawal of its licence or heavy penalty. A statement on Tuesday by the Director of Public Affairs of the NCC, Dr Ikechukwu Adinde, noted that “following the earlier directive on the suspension of new SIM registration by network operators, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr. Isa Ali Ibrahim (Pantami) convened an urgent meeting of key stakeholders in the Communications industry on Monday, December 14, 2020.” DAILY POST recalls that this is coming less than a week after the NCC had ordered telecommunications companies to halt the sale and activation of Subscriber Identification Module (SIM). NCC warned that non-compliance by network operators could lead to withdrawal of operating license.

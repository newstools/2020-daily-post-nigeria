Wednesdayâ€™s Premier League matches at Arsenal, Fulham and West Ham will be played behind closed doors, as London moved into Tier-3 coronavirus restrictions on Monday. The order kicks in after midnight on Tuesday night, following a spike in cases. It means sporting events will once again take place without crowds. Health Secretary Matt Hancock briefed MPs in London and the South East about the increase in COVID-19 restrictions during a conference call on Monday afternoon ahead of a formal announcement. Under tier three, which is already in force in large swaths of northern England the Midlands, sports events must take place without any spectators. The move will affect teams in the Premier League, EFL and National League in and around the capital that had started to re-admit up to 2,000 spectators to their matches in the past fortnight. Among the football fixtures affected this Saturday will be Crystal Palace vs Liverpool in the Premier League plus Brentford vs Reading and Millwall vs Nottingham Forest in the Championship.

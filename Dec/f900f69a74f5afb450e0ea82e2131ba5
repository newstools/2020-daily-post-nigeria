The Kaduna State Chairman of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, (PFN), Apostle Emmanuel Egoh Bako and his wife, Mrs Cindy Bako, were on Friday evening, 25th December 2020, kidnapped by unknown gunmen at their residence in Albarka Camp, Fadan Kagoma, near Kafanchan in Jema’a local government area. The state chairman of CAN, Rev. John Joseph Hayab, who confirmed the kidnap of the cleric and his wife to DAILY POST said the Christmas celebration came and went with sad dust of abduction of a religious leader with his wife. Apostle Emmanuel Egoh Bako, according to Rev. Hayab, is the Secretary, Southern Kaduna Christian Leaders Association Hayab lamented that the Church has had enough of relentless kidnapping of its members and ransoms being paid before getting their freedom. He described Apostle Bako as a very strong member of Jema’a network, a father to many, a front runner of peace, justice and unity in Southern Kaduna, calling on security agencies to help ensure their release from their abductors. When contacted, the State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige, who promised to get back to our correspondent on the alleged abduction of the cleric and his wife did not do so, until the time of filing this report.

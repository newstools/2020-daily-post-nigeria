The parents, in their numbers, were chanting, “wetin we want? Justice! How we want am? Now now!” This is happening after the Nigeria Police filed a suit on Thursday demanding an immediate end to the judicial panels of inquiry going on in different states in the country. The panels were set up by state governors, in accordance with the recommendation of the National Executive Council, NEC, to probe allegations of police brutality especially by men of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad. The police, through its lawyer, O. M. Atoyebi, argued that the states lacked the power to set up panels to investigate activities of the police force. The force also urged the court to restrain the Attorneys-General of the 36 states of the federation and their various panels of inquiry from going ahead with the probe on police impunity.

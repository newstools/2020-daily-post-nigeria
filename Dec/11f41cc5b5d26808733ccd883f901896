The leadership of the Senate has hinted on engaging the Executive in the purchase of COVID-19 vaccine in Nigeria. This was concluded in a meeting with the Executive which looked at possible ways to purchase COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. The meeting presided over by the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan also had Minister of Finance, Zainab Ahmed; Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire; Minister of State for Health, Sen. Dr. Olorunimbe Mamora; Director-General, Budget and National Planning, Ben Akabueze; Director-General, National Centre for Disease Control, Chikwe Ihekweazu; and Director-General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC). Speaking, Lawan said the meeting was to ascertain the federal government’s preparedness towards the purchase of the COVID-19 vaccine. “Essentially, we want you to tell us how we are going to be able to provide the vaccines in such a manner that the vaccines are not only acquired, but remain efficacious and effective, that they are not invalidated because of any challenge in the area of storage or during transportation. And we know ours is a very difficult and sometimes impossible environment. “Other countries have already started receiving the vaccines, even though I’m not sure if there’s any African country that has received. But if any African country should receive first, it should be Nigeria. “Alongside these, you should also give us an idea on how we are going to start the vaccination. “We need to have the strategy of how we intend to do it, so that we don’t run into any chaos,” Lawan said.

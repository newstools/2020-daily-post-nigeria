A former Chief Whip of the Nigerian Senate, Senator Roland Owie, on Wednesday advised the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), not to contest for the presidency in 2023. According to him, it would be the turn of the South-East to produce the next president of Nigeria. Owie stated this while speaking on the emergence of a group, Justice and Peace Forum in Nigeria (JPFN), which would be launched early in 2021. He noted that the North still has about four years after 2023 to catch up with the South since the rotation of the presidency started in 1999. “The southern part of Nigeria has taken 14 years plus. So when Buhari finishes in 2023, even though it is a thorny regime, the north still has four years. “If Tinubu knows that Nigeria has peace with this zoning, if he knows that do unto others as you will want them do unto you, he should not think of the presidency. “Because if we all agree by 2023 that the presidency should come to the south, it is not to south west, it is not to south-south, it is to south-east. “If all the major political parties agree that it should come to the south, the south-west is out of it, they have completed their eight years,” Owie said.

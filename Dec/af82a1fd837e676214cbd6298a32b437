The United States of America has reacted to the death of immediate-past Nigerian ambassador to the country, late Justice Sylvanus Nsofor. Nsofor, a retired Justice of the Court of Appeal, died in the US on December 10 after a brief illness at the age of 85. In a statement on Tuesday, the US Department of State said it was saddened by the passing of Nsofor. It expressed condolences to the family of the late ambassador and staff of the Nigeria embassy. “Amb. Nsofor was an important and influential member of the diplomatic community in Washington, D.C., and helped to strengthen our partnerships across the West Africa region. “His long career in public service, which spanned both the law and diplomacy, was a testament to his dedication to the Nigerian people. “In striving to find common ground between the UN and Nigeria, he supported mutually beneficial programmes and initiatives across a wide range of sectors, including educational exchange, rule of law, and business investment. “He saw tremendous value in people-to-people connections and fostered a spirit of cooperation across the diplomatic corps,’’ the statement said. It added that the Department of State “honours Nsofor’s leadership in promoting diplomatic exchange and understanding during his tenure in the U.S.’’

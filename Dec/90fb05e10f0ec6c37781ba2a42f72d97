Former Super Eagles star, Osaze Odemwingie has accused Amara, wife of former national team captain, Nwankwo Kanu, of chasing him. Osaze is accusing Amara of sliding into his DM and “chasing” him “relentlessly.” The former Super Eagles star warned Amara to stay off, adding that her husband, Kanu, has his(Osaze) number and insisted that it is not in African culture for a woman to message another man without taking permission from her husband. “Destruction is upon her” he wrote on Instagram, adding that Nigeria is in this state because too many people want to be like Americans. The former Lille star reminded the wife of the Arsenal legend that “it is not our culture to message another man without your husband. Osaze also accused Kanu’s son of practising “fake Christianity.” “How can a wife of a legend like @kingkanu4 be chasing me for a chat relentlessly (check your DM, check your DM ) na by force? @amarakanu. “Your husband has my number and it’s not in our culture to msg another man without asking your husband. “Moreover you are wearing an arsenal kit and he can ask them for advice about knee surgery because he also suffered from similar issues. “Your son can’t have a cross on his neck and make those hand signs. That’s fake Christianity if you didn’t know ok. Our people sell their own to conform to African American. “@amarakanu, why why why Amara? (Delailah). We love our strong man Papilo. Wash your hands well oh. And most importantly your hearts as I am preaching to many now. Nigeria? is more precious to God than America?” Osaze cautioned Amara saying if her hello to him cannot be public “it’s
probably not just a hello.”

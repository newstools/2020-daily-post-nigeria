Aisha, wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, has reacted to reports that she fled Nigeria to Dubai due to security issues in the Presidential Villa. Mrs Buhari disclosed that she travelled out of the country for medical checkup. The First Lady disclosed this through one of her aides, Kabiru Dodo, in Jalingo, Taraba State over the weekend when her foundation presented some items to widows. Representing Aisha Buhari, Dodo said the First Lady left her children, husband, and family in the country. According to Dodo: “The First Lady travelled for her medical trip, she did not flee the country because of insecurity. “She left her children, her husband and family in Nigeria. “What people are saying is baseless and worth nothing to be considered. “I want to tell the whole world that I do speak to her on daily basis and she is ready to return to the country as soon as she is done with the medical treatment abroad.”

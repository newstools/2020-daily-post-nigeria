Tottenham Hotspur would welcome fellow Europa League side Royal Antwerp as both sides meet in Group J. The Londoners were held to a 3-3 draw by LASK Linz last time out in the European competition and they must win to finish a point above their opponents in the group. Jose Mourinho responded to that ill-fated outing in Europe last week with a 2-0 home win over Arsenal but a couple of personnel alteration could be expected on the back of their Premier League success on Sunday. Here is a prediction of how Tottenham Hotspurs could the line-up for the contest. Absent; Joe Rondon (ineligible), Erik Lamela (foot) Possible; Tanguy Ndombele(muscle strain) Portuguese manager Jose Mourinho has successfully identified his preferred starting team for Europa League games. In the mix are the likes of Gareth Bale, Vinicius Junior, Dele Alli and Lucas Moura which are the make-up. Since Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg and Moussa Sissoko started against the Gunners and Tanguy Ndombele nursing a knock, Harry Winks and Giovani Lo Celso should run the strings in the midfield. The ineligibility of Joe Rondon at centre back possess a concern, but Japhet Tanganga is available as a replacement possibly alongside Davinson Sanchez. Changes would be anticipated in Tottenham’s defensive line as well as who man’s the goal for them, with Matt Doherty, Ben Davies and Joe Hart in contention for a starting place. Despite the fact that the London side needs at least a point to finish top of the group, key men like Heung-Min Son and Harry Kane may not play a part in this Europa League fixture. here is how Hotspur’s possible line-up against Royal Antwerp could pan out; Joe Hart; Matt Doherty, Davinson Sanchez, Japhet Tanganga, Ben Davies; Harry Winks, Giovani Lo Celso; Gareth Bale, Dele Alli, Lucas Moura; Vinicius Junior.

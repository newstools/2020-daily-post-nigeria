Former Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has urged manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to get rid of midfielder, Fred, after his sending off in the Red Devils’ Champions League 3-1 defeat to Paris Saint-Germain. Fred was booked for pushing his head towards PSG star, Leandro Paredes, in the first half before he was sent off for a foul on Ander Herrera in the second half of the encounter. Owen wants Solskjaer not to feature Fred in his team again, adding that what the Brazilian did was pathetic. “Mistakes all around really,” Owen told BT Sport ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash with West Ham on Saturday. “It [the clash with Paredes] was a red card. You are a grown man, you do not need to do a petulant thing like that to put your team at risk. “If I was a manager, and one of my players did that, he would never play for me again. It is pathetic. “Overall, you’ve to blame Fred but also Solskjaer. The manager has to protect him and the team in that situation, so they are both to blame.”

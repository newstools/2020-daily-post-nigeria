The former Speaker, Kano State House of Assembly, Abdulaziz Garba Gafasa and 13 other members loyal to him have described speculations that they are moving out of the APC to PDP in protest of what happened to them as a baseless cooked up story. Gafasa said there was no place or time he spoke about what happened to him or discussed plans to decamp from the ruling APC. “You can see that enemies are at work speculating that I’m moving out of APC to PDP, this is nothing but a baseless lie created to tarnish my name and reputation”. He said, “I’m still and always loyal to our Party APC and indeed our Governor Dr Abdullahi Umar Ganduje and anybody who thinks otherwise should go and die”. The new elected Speaker of the House, Hamisu Ibrahim Chidari also refuted the speculation that his predecessor was decamping to PDP saying the story was a mischievous calculated one to cause confusion in the State and the house

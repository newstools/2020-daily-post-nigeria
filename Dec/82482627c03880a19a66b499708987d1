The Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre, Sam Adeyemi has weighed into the disagreement between the governments and churches over New Year cross over services. The government had directed churches to obey COVID-19 protocols and curfew during cross over services. However, some churches criticised the government directives. Adeyemi, speaking on the development, urged Christians not to stress about timing but partake in their crossover services at any time. According to him, the major thing is to crossover to 2021. The outspoken pastor on his Twitter page wrote: “ If you say “Happy New Year” at 2pm on 31st December in Lagos, you won’t be wrong. You’ll only be joining people in Sydney Australia to say it at that time. In fact, you’ll be 10 hours ahead of others in Nigeria. “ Don’t stress over time to crossover. Just crossover. #HappyNewYear.” This is coming after the Christian leadership in Nigeria, CAN, instructed worship centres to respect government’s directives. President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev Samson Ayokunle, appealed to churches to strictly adhere to COVID-19 protocols and guidelines issued by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), the federal and the state governments.

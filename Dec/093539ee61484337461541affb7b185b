Former Manchester City striker, Mario Balotelli, has finally signed with Serie B side, Monza after being without a club for five months following his exit from Brescia. Balotelli’s contract was terminated by Brescia back in July. The Italian star will wear the number 45 shirt at Brescia. “I thank the president Berlusconi and Adriano Galliani for this opportunity,” Balotelli told La Gazzetta dello Sport. “I will do everything to help Monza reach Serie A.”

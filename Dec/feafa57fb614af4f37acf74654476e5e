Following the spike in cases of COVID-19 in many countries around the world and the sharp increase in the number of cases in Nigeria, the Ekiti State Government has advised residents in the State to henceforth adhere strictly to all laid down protocols to prevent a resurgence of the disease in the State. The State Commissioner for Information and Values Orientation, Hon. Akin Omole who gave the advice in Ado Ekiti, said that simple precautions like wearing a mask, maintaining physical distancing, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, regular handwashing with soap and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue would go a long way in helping to stem the spread of the virus. Reiterating the commitment of the Fayemi-led administration to the general wellbeing of people in the State; Omole assured that in spite of the paucity of funds occasioned by the meager allocation accruing to the State from the Federation account, the administration had properly positioned the State to counter the spread of all communicable diseases including COVID-19. He added that Governor Kayode Fayemi had also directed that all public servants and political appointees must wear appropriate nose masks in public places. Omole stressed the need for all stakeholders to support the efforts of government towards fighting the spread of the pandemic, emphasizing that it is for their benefit to do so.

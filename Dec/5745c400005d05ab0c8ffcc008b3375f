A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted the request by Adeola Adedipe, a defence lawyer in the trial of former Chairman of the Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abulrasheed Maina, to be allowed to withdraw from the case. Recall that Adedipe had applied to withdraw from representing Maina in a case of money laundering brought against him. The lawyer who was representing Mainaâ€™s company, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd, told Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Wednesday, at the resumption of proceedings, that he has filed a notice, signifying his intention to withdraw from further representation of his client. He also told the court that he has not been paid by his client. Following the development, he was granted leave by the federal high court on Thursday. The court granted him leave on grounds of not being paid for his services and being unable to locate Mr. Maina who engaged him to represent the company listed as the second defendant in the case. Meanwhile, Operatives of the Nigerian Intelligence Service and anti-corruption agents, on Monday evening, rearrested Abdulrasheed Maina in Niger Republic. The ex-pensions boss repeatedly failed to appear in court for the continuation of his trial which led to the revocation of his bail by Justice Abang.

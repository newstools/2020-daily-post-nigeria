WBC champion, Tyson Fury, has said that he would knock out the unified heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua, in three rounds when they meet in an all-British bout in 2021. Fury said this while reacting to Joshua’s victory over Bulgarian fighter, Kubrat Pulev. Joshua knocked out his mandatory challenger, Pulev, in round nine on Saturday night at the Wembley Arena in London after a dramatic and entertaining affair to set up a possible clash with Fury. “I’m up for anything. Who wants to see Anthony Joshua box Tyson Fury in 2021? I started this game in 2013 and I have been chasing the belts ever since. Whoever has got the belt, I would love to compete with them. If that is Tyson Fury then let it be Tyson Fury,” Joshua said after the fight. Reacting, Fury in a video post via his Twitter handle wrote: “Well there you go everyone,” he began. “Anthony Joshua just s*** himself live on television. “He got asked if he wants the fight and he went around the bushes and put his a*** in the hedge. “I want the fight, I want the fight next. I’ll knock him out inside three rounds. He’s a big, bum dosser, I can’t wait to knock him out.” .@anthonyfjoshua it’s a matter of time….. ⏰ ⏰ ⏰ I’ll spank you like I did @BronzeBomber 2/3 rounds. #YOUBUMSOSER #letsgetiton pic.twitter.com/7m8A8Je0ui — TYSON FURY (@Tyson_Fury) December 12, 2020

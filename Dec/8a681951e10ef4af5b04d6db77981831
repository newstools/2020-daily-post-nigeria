Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said Karim Benzema is playing “on a different level” after helping Los Blancos to another win. Benzema scored one and laid on two assists, as Madrid made it five straight wins in all competitions by defeating Eibar 3-1 in LaLiga on Sunday. It was the 30th time the French striker has scored and assisted in the same league game. Only Cristiano Ronaldo (44) has done it more often for Madrid in the 21st century. “Benzema is a match winner because what he’s doing is on a different level, not just because of the goals,” Zidane told a press conference. “I always repeat myself saying the same thing about Karim. It’s not only his goals, he’s a focal point in our game. He’s very important for us and when he scores, it’s even better, obviously, but he’s very important for our team.” Madrid are now joint top with city rivals Atletico, with 29 points, although Diego Simeone’s men have played two fewer games.

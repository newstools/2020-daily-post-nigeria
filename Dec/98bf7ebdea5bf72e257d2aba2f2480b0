The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rebuked President Muhammadu Buhari over the abduction of no fewer than 600 students from the Government Science Secondary School in Kankara Local Government Area of Katsina State. PDP said the abduction had shown that Buhari is incapable of securing Nigerians. Some unknown gunmen had invaded GSS in Kankara and abducted about 600 students. However, spokesman of PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan said the abduction exposed Buhari’s failure as Commander-In-Chief. Ologbondiyan noted that Buhari’s inability to secure Nigeria was responsible for the call for his resignation. A statement by Ologbondiyan reads partly: “Our party holds as perplexing that at a time the people of Katsina should have heaved a sigh of relief because of his presence, the abduction happened right under Mr. President’s nose; in his home state, where he had gone holidaying. “This development has further exposed the failure of President Buhari to manage high level security intelligence that ought to accompany a presidential visit.” The PDP’s spokesman wondered why the abduction occurred when Buhari was in Daura, his hometown. “The time of the attack buttresses the fact that President Buhari, as the commander-in-chief, is totally incapable of securing our nation; the very reason there have been widespread calls by patriotic Nigerians that he should resign,” he added.

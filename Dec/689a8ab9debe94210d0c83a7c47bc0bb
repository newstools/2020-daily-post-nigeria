The lawmaker spoke to State House correspondents after meeting with Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Gbaja disclosed that a date had been agreed and will be made public soon. The Speaker said the President is concerned about the spate of insecurity in the country. On Tuesday at the plenary, the Green Chamber of the National Assembly agreed on a motion to invite Buhari.

The authorities of the Bayelsa State Police Command said it has arrested a housewife identified as Mrs. Eniye Zuokemefa Peter, over alleged complicity in last weekend killing of her husband in Yenagoa. Recall that a lecturer at the Bayelsa College of Education in Sagbama, Enebraye Zuokemefa Peter, was reportedly murdered by unknown gunmen. DAILY POST, gathered that Mrs. Eniye Zuokemefa Peter’s arrest is based on petitions from the deceased family and on complaints of previous threats to his life during domestic squabbles over alleged infidelity and fathering two children outside marriage. DAILY POST, also gathered that the deceased was shot three times by the criminals on Friday while transacting business at a Point-of-Sale (POS) along the old Assembly quarters road in Ekeki area of Yenagoa. A family member, who pleaded anonymity told DAILY POST that the accused wife had on several occasions threatened to kill her husband over allegations of fathering children outside their marriage due to her inability to bear him a child. ‘The marriage is filled with turbulence, with the woman packing out of her matrimonial home severally but they recently made up when he arrived in Yenagoa from a study trip abroad.’ It was also gathered that the deceased lecturer had in the past come under armed attack at his home by unknown gunmen, “He was always heard telling family members and close friends to hold his wife responsible if anything happened to him’’. The police are currently on the trail of some four persons suspected to have killed the lecturer and were last seen driving a red coloured tinted Toyota. “The vehicle was seen moving suspiciously around the resident of the deceased and was later seen sharing monies at a drinking spot a few meters away from the scene of the crime”.

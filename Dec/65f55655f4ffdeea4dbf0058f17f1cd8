The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Monday said it has found its missing ad hoc staff. The staff were declared missing during the Dec. 5, Bakura State Constituency by-election in Zamfara State. Mr Nick Dazang, INEC Director of Voter Education and Publicity, made the confirmation on Monday. According to him, the ad hoc staff who were found hale and hearty ran for dear lives during a commotion and in the process could not retrace their ways back. “I am exceedingly glad to report that INEC Administrative Secretary in Zamfara State, Mr Garba Lawal just informed me that our ad hoc staff who went missing have been found, hale and hearty.” Dazang further commended the state Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), and security agencies for their efforts in finding the missing ad hoc staff.

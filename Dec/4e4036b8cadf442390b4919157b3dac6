The World Health Organization’s Director-General, Tedros Ghebreyesus, says health workers should be prioritised as countries prepare to roll out Coronavirus vaccines in the coming days, weeks and months. Ghebreyesus, who spoke from WHO headquarters in Geneva, said priority should also be given to the elderly and people at high risk of serious disease in administering the COVID-19 vaccine. “As supply increases, the next groups to be prioritised would include those who have a higher risk of severe disease because of their underlying conditions and marginalised groups at higher risk. “The recommendations are based on the so-called Values Framework and Population Prioritisation Roadmap, issued by a WHO advisory group on immunisation. “In the initial stages of rollout, with only a small proportion of a country’s population immunised, it’s vital that governments, communities and individuals continue using proven public health tools,” Ghebreyesus said. WHO DG noted that protesting people with highest risk of serious disease or death as a result of age are also a high priority group will reduce severe disease and death and take the burden off health systems, NAN reports.

A man suspected to be an armed robber has been killed during a gun battle with the police in Ogun State, DAILY POST reports. The suspect was gunned down on Sunday along the Sagamu/Ikenne expressway in Ogun State. It was gathered that a distress call was made to the police at Ikenne divisional police headquarters, that an armed robbery gang were operating between Adelex filling station and Ladgroup company, dispossessing people of their valuables at gunpoint. Acting on the distress call, the DPO of Ikenne division, CSP Ndoukauba Onuma, reportedly mobilised his patrol team and personnel of 71pmf to the scene. “On sighting the policemen, the hoodlums engaged them in a gun battle, consequent upon which one of the robbers was shot dead while others escaped into the bush with varying degrees of gunshot injuries,” Ogun police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi told DAILY POST on Monday. Oyeyemi disclosed that a mock gun and a Toyota Corolla car with registration number KNN 84 TD, which was snatched from its owner, were recovered at the scene of the incident. DAILY POST reports that the Ogun Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, expressed satisfaction over the quick response of his men to the distress call. Ajogun has, therefore, ordered a massive manhunt for the escaped members of the gang, while appealing to the public, hospitals and traditional healers to notify the police if they sight anybody with gunshot injuries.

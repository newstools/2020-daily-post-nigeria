Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has provided the latest team news ahead of his side’s away Premier League clash with Sheffield United on Thursday night. Solskjaer also named the players that would not take part in Man United’s squad to tackle Sheffield at Bramall Lane. Solskjaer’s side head to the game following a 0-0 draw with Manchester United in the Premier League derby last weekend. “Edinson has done well in his rehab, but we’re still going to decide on whether we should risk him,” Solskjaer told a pre-match press conference on Tuesday. “Because it is a risk, it’s a little bit too early. I doubt he’ll be available for me to pick him tomorrow. “Marcos has just felt a niggle in his calf again. He’s worked really hard to come back, he played a game with the Reserves and got a knock there. Worked really hard again, then felt something. “He’s hopefully back in January, Marcos. Phil [Jones] should be ready by January and Sergio [Romero] has been training hard as well.” “We know we can’t take any risks if there are any niggles,” he added.
“There are a couple of little things that we’re waiting for, to see how they react, before we pick the squad.”

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has bemoaned his side’s bad luck following their 2-1 defeat at Everton on Saturday. The Gunners suffered their eighth loss of the Premier League side at Goodison Park. Rob Holding who captained Arteta’s side for the game, put the goal past Bernd Leno for Everton’s opener, before Nicolas Pepe levelled from the penalty spot. Yerry Mina headed in the second for the hosts before half time, a goal that proved to be the winner. Arteta told the media after the game: “We created enough chances not to lose the game, the luck is not on our side. “It is difficult when you are facing a team that is constantly defending really low and are wasting time. “The boys are fighting. The boys are upset, the boys are together.”

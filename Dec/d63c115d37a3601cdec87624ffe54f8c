Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has blamed goalkeeper, David de Gea for RB Leipzig’s third goal following the Red Devils’ Champions League 3-2 defeat against the Bundesliga side on Tuesday night. Scholes also slammed De Gea for a ‘criminal’ error against RB Leipzig, adding that the Spain shot-stopper was scared of getting himself hurt. He believes De Gea’s shoddy goal-keeping work cost Man United to lose against the host in Germany. RB Leipzig defeated Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side, thanks to three goals from Angelino, Amadou Haidara and Justin Kluivert. Two early goals left Man United on the back foot and they eventually succumbed to defeat, despite a late fightback. The third Leipzig goal did not cover De Gea in glory, as the goalkeeper appeared to turn his back to play to allow Kluivert an easy finish. “David de Gea here, he bottles it,” Scholes told BT Sport. “He’s scared of getting himself hurt. It should never go across the box like that ever. “Harry Maguire looks wooden, he’s very stiff. De Gea, as a goalkeeper, come out, make yourself as big as you can – you might get smashed in the face, but he turns his back away. “He actually makes himself smaller. It’s criminal for such an experienced goalkeeper. It’s criminal.”

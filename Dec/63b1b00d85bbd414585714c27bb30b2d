Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari against imposing another possible lockdown on Nigerians. Giwa, while addressing his members in Akure on Sunday, said President Buhari should expect mass protest from the people if he decides to lockdown Nigeria again. With the recent surge in Covid-19 cases, there is the possibility of another lockdown. Findings show that many citizens no longer take covid-19 precautions as face masks and hand washing are not enforced again in many shopping malls, places of worship and other public places. However, Pastor Giwa said politicians should be held responsible in case the Nigeria Centre For Disease Control still claims the existence of Covid-19 in the country. “In case they still want to make another money from Covid-19 and insisting that the virus has resurfaced, blame the politicians. “Do they maintain social distancing whenever there is a political rally or campaign? Stop fooling Nigerians and do what is right. “Let me tell President Buhari that Nigerians are ready for mass protest if he orders for another senseless lockdown again.”

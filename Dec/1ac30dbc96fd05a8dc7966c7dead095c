Lionel Messi and Barcelona have been fined €780, after the Argentine star got a yellow card for removing his shirt to pay tribute to the late Diego Maradona, following his goal in the 4-0 win over Osasuna on Sunday. Messi was fined €600, while his club were fined €180. The 33-year-old paid homage to Maradona by taking off his Barcelona shirt, to reveal a Newell’s Old Boys shirt under belonging to Maradona. The Spanish football federation’s competition committee threw out Barca’s appeal against the punishment. The committee’s statement said that while it accepted the gesture was a tribute, Article 93 of the disciplinary code states that a player should be punished for removing their shirt when celebrating, irrespective of the motive. Messi’s booking pushes him one game closer to a ban.

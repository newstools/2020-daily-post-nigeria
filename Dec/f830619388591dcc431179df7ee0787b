United States President-elect, Joe Biden, has urged President Donald Trump to immediately sign the COVID-19 relief bill. On Saturday, the Democrat accused Trump of delay despite the hard times Americans face. Stressing the importance of the bill, Biden noted that it would keep small businesses afloat, extend unemployment benefits, and help struggling families. “It is the day after Christmas, and millions of families don’t know if they’ll be able to make ends meet because of President Donald Trump’s refusal to sign an economic relief bill approved by Congress with an overwhelming and bipartisan majority. “This abdication of responsibility has devastating consequences. This bill is critical. It needs to be signed into law now.” Biden hinted plans to take additional actions after assuming office in January. The former Senator listed funding for distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccine, as well as increasing testing capacity.

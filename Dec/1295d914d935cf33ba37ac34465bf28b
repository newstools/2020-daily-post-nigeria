The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, has argued that nobody was killed during the End SARS protest at Lekki toll gate in Lagos State. Buratai maintained that there was no corpse during the protest at Lekki toll gate. The Army chief spoke at the decoration of 39 newly promoted Major Generals, yesterday in Abuja. He stressed that those claiming protesters were killed were seeing double. Buratai said: “I am glad that we held the Spiritual Warfare Seminar on Wednesday and most of the decorated Generals today are graduates of the Spiritual Warfare Seminar. “I must say that the Spiritual Warfare Seminar we had last time, helped us during the last #EndSARS protest to the extent that there was no single corpse, but some persons were seeing double at Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos State.” Several protesters demonstrating against bad governance were reported killed by soldiers at the Lekki toll gate. Popular Nigerian Disc Jockey, Obianuju Catherine Udeh, also known as DJ Switch, had alleged that soldiers shot and killed some of the people protesting at Lekki toll gate. However, the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army had maintained that soldiers drafted to the scene didn’t kill any protester. The Army, however, admitted that soldiers were at the venue of the protest but did not kill anybody.

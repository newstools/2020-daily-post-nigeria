A non-governmental organisation, Anambra State Civil Society Network (ACSONET) has called for justice for the okada rider killed on Tuesday night by a policeman for protesting the impounding of his motorcycle. The group tasked the Anambra State governor, Chief Willie Obiano and the State commissioner of police, CP John Abang to ensure that the slain motorcyclist got justice. It condemned the action of the policeman and described the shooting of the okada rider as unjustifiable. An unidentified policeman had on Tuesday at Igbo-Ukwu killed one Okada rider who joined his colleagues to protest the impounding of their motorcycles for violating the ban on movement of motorcycles after 9pm. Chairman of ACSONET, Prince Chris Azor in a press release made available to DAILY POST said, “We condemn in strongest terms, the avoidable killing of a commercial motorcyclist in Igbo- Ukwu, Aguata Local Government Area, Anambra State, by a Policeman. “We note with shock and discomfiture, the avoidable killing. From intelligence reports by our reliable sources, an argument ensued between some men of the Nigeria Police and the motorcyclist, resulting in the shooting to death of the latter. “We are of the opinion that this condemnable action was avoidable and therefore absolutely unjustifiable. “However, we call on those affected and other law abiding citizens to be calm and follow due process in addressing this unfortunate and regrettable incident. “We implore the State Government, the Nigeria Police and other relevant stakeholders to walk the talk by ensuring speedy investigation of the incidents and adequate remediations, going forward. “We, as defenders of citizens’ rights are at alert and following up the process with a view to ensuring that justice is served,” Azor said.

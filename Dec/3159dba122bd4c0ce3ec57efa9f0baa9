Burna Boy, Davido and other Nigerian artistes have called for the release of Omah Lay and Tems. Tems and Omah Lay were arrested in Uganda for flouting COVID-19 order in the country. They were charged to court and detained in Uganda prison till Wednesday. Their arrest has since stirred reactions from the likes of Burna Boy, Davido who asked the Ugandan government to release their colleagues to return to Nigeria.

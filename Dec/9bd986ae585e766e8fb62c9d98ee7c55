President Muhammadu Buhari says he was shocked and speechless when he received information about Sam Nda-Isaiah’s death. This is contained in his condolence letter to the family on Thursday. The Nigerian leader urged them to uphold the family’s name. “On behalf of the Federal Government and my family, I sincerely express my condolence on the sudden transition of my friend and ally, Mr. Sam Nda-Isaiah, Publisher of Leadership Newspapers. “Indeed, Sam’s untimely passage filled me with shock and sadness to the point that I was lost for words when the news reached me,” he said. The president added that he will miss the deceased. He described Nda-Isaiah as a massive fish gone out of the media ocean and the political arena. “I condole with the Nda-Isaiah family, media fraternity and all who mourn this man of conviction, a resolute and dogged believer in a better country. Nigeria has no doubt lost an exemplary gentleman.” Buhari prayed that God Almighty consoles Sam’s family, friends and associates and grants his soul peaceful rest. His letter was delivered to Sam’s younger brother, Abraham, by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant on Media; Sarki Abba, Senior Special Assistant on Domestic Affairs, and State Chief of Protocol, Ambassador Lawal Kazaure.

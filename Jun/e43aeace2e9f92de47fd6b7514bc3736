Manchester United coach, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hinted that players who were involved in its FA Cup quarter-final victory against Norwich City over the weekend will be available for a starting berth when they take on Brighton on Tuesday in the Premier League. Solskjaer’s men will face Brighton in an away EPL clash at the Falmer Stadium on Tuesday night, after defeating Norwich 2-1 at Carrow Road on Saturday to book their place in the FA Cup semi-final where they will tackle Chelsea. “Apart from, of course, the after-effect of the physical work-out and coming back late, they [the players] had a recovery day yesterday and today will be an easy day, and we’re just preparing for tomorrow,” Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference on Monday when asked if there were any injury issues in his squad. “I think the buzz and the energy that the win and a semi-final place will give you will help us tomorrow night.” Solskjaer added: “We manage a squad, we manage players differently and Luke has had a good upturn in form. “He’s playing some good football, let’s see if he starts this one.” The match kick-off time is 8:15 pm, Nigerian time.

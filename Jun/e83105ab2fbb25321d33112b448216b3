The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has welcomed the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki into its fold. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan described Obaseki’s decision as courageous and patriotic. In a statement, Ologbondiyan said: “The party praised the commitment, dedication and sacrifices of PDP leaders, critical stakeholders and teeming members in Edo state, who had continued to work hard to keep the party alive and made it attractive to the people of Edo State.” Stressing that Edo State has always been home to the PDP, Ologbondiyan added: “PDP government will always put the interest of the people first in line with the party’s manifesto and guiding principles.” The PDP reassured all members of strict adherence to the principles of internal democracy in all its activities. Obaseki had earlier teamed up with PDP, after he defected from the All Progressives Congress, APC, following irreconcilable differences with the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole.

Ajax have confirmed Manchester United are interested in signing Donny van de Beek. Van de Beek is valued at £46million by the Dutch club and United have been scouting the 23-year-old for a while. “It’s clear that clubs like Real Madrid and United are showing interest in Donny van de Beek,” Ajax CEO, Edwin van der Saar told NOS. Real Madrid were initial favourites to land Van de Beek, but the global coronavirus pandemic has brought about financial uncertainty. United are now looking to hijack the deal, but also remain interested in Dortmund forward Jadon Sancho and Velez prospect Thiago Almada.

Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, stayed away from the meeting of the All Progressives Congress (APC) governors had with the National Working Committee (NWC). Obaseki was in Abuja but went to see President Muhammadu Buhari instead. The APC governors were led to the meeting by their chairman and Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu. Others were Rotimi Akeredolu – Ondo, Babajide Sanwo-Olu – Lagos, Mohammed Inuwa – Gombe, Umar Ganduje – Kano and AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq – Kwara. The meeting deliberated on the forthcoming governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States. Direct primary was endorsed for Edo election, while that of Ondo will be decided at a later date. Speaking after the meeting, Oshiomhole described governors as assets to the party. He noted that once a candidate emerged, everyone would do their best to persuade people to vote for the APC. Oshiomhole further commented on the two governors seeking the party’s ticket. He said: “I am sure that by the special grace of God, the Ondo Governor is here, he did well and electorate are more sophisticated now, so we have no fear about that. “Obaseki is not here but issues of primaries are well spelt out in our constitution and we are following it as strictly as possible. So nothing to worry about at all.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is set to start Paul Pogba for the first time in 10 months, when they host Sheffield United on Wednesday, according to SportsMail. Pogba is fit again after recovering from an ankle problem, that kept him sidelined since Boxing Day. The France midfielder enjoyed an impressive cameo in the 1-1 draw against Tottenham Hotspur last Friday, winning the penalty that Bruno Fernandes converted. Solskjaer is giving serious consideration to playing Pogba from the start against the Blades, in a move that could see him start with Fernandes for the first time. Fred, Scott McTominay and Fernandes started in central midfield against Tottenham, but one will drop to the bench to accommodate Pogba. Kick off is 6pm West African time.

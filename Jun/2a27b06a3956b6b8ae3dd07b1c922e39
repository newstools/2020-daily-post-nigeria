Governor Godwin Obaseki has condemned the decision of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Appeal Committee for the Edo governorship election. The panel ratified his earlier disqualification by the Screening Committee. A statement on Sunday by Obaseki’s spokesman, Crusoe Osagie, mocked APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole “and his puppet screening committees”. He condemned the “destruction of smoldering integrity of our great party under Oshiomhole’s watch”. The statement said as if the exclusion of Obaseki by the screening committee was not sufficient, APC announced that the appeal committee “upheld the dubious disqualification”. “The question is how does an Appeal Committee claim to uphold an issue that was not appealed?,” it quipped. The aide noted that Obaseki has been unequivocal in his stance that he was not going to appeal his disqualification. He called the committee, “a gathering of court’s jesters, who congregated to massage the ego of their paymaster, who is Comrade Oshiomhole.” He said placing the “disgraceful charade against the mantra of integrity which ought to be the character of APC, reveals the depth of the abyss Oshiomhole has dragged the party.” Obaseki thanked his supporters “across party divides and the entire spectrum of the society for their firm solidarity and unwavering support.” The governor said he remains focused on, “sustaining the good governance and growth trajectory of Edo State”.

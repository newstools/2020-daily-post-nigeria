The All Progressives Congress (APC) has announced the disqualification of Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, from the June 22 primary election. Recall that Obaseki had earlier raised an alarm, alleging that the APC chairman planned to announce his disqualification in a press conference. However, shortly after the allegations were made, chairman of the APC screening committee, Jonathan Ayuba, announced Obasekiâ€™s disqualification while presenting his report to Adams Oshiomhole, APC national chairman, at the national secretariat in Abuja Ayuba said Obaseki was disqualified on account of a defective certificate. The panel also disqualified two other aspirants, Matthew Aigbuhuenze Iduoriyekemwen and Chris Ogiemwonyi.

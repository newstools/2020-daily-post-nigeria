The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, on Monday called on Nnia Nwodo, President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo to “emulate Adams Oshiomhole,” immediate past National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC. OYC said Nwodo should emulate Oshiomhole and accept the dissolution of his exco over their Inability to conclude the registration process of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, which his predecessor, Chief Gary Igariwey began in 2016. They made the call in a statement signed by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, President General of OYC; Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, and OYC Secretary-General. The statement sent to DAILY POST reads: “We can authoritatively say that the pursuits of political gains using the Igbo platform, diverted the attention of Nwodo to complete the process of registration in the Corporate Affairs Commission which his predecessor started. “Igbo Elders, Traditional Rulers and Religious Groups came together and advance the collective interests of Igbo Nation by Salvaging the illegalities of the past Regimes and endorsed the Completion of the Process of Nwodo’s Predecessor Chief Igariwey started which was abandoned by him(Nwodo). “There’s nothing wrong about what the Elders, Traditional Rulers, Religious Groups had done but it is a Salvage Mission aimed at putting Igbos back on track and stop certain individuals from seen as Untouchables, from Using Igbo platform(Ohanaeze Ndigbo)to Curry Favour from Igbo Oppressors.” OYC commended the decisions of Igbo elders, traditional rulers and religious groups to formally take over the reins of power based on the constitution of Ohanaeze Ndigbo from the Buccaneers that hijacked the Igbo platform for 2023. “We urge them to reserve Nwodo a permanent seat as a BOT member, as these appropriate measures will be a soft landing for him and his Buccaneers Cartel to wind up their plans and support pro Igbo agendas. “We advise that no further actions from Nwodo will be tolerated in Igboland, as the Watchdog of Igbo Society, Enough is Enough.”

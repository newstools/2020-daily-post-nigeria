Former Tottenham manager, Tim Sherwood has identified Arsenal forward, Gabriel Martinelli, as the player that should replace captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at Emirates. Aubameyang’s future at the Gunners remains uncertain. The Gabon striker is yet to agree on new terms with Arsenal and has been linked with an exit this summer’s transfer window. His current contract with Arsenal will expire in the summer of 2020. But Sherwood believes Martinelli can replace Aubameyang if the 30-year-old leaves the North London club this summer. “I have been fortunate enough to be invited to the training ground at Arsenal and what is big on his [Arteta’s] priority list is to improve the players,” Sherwood told Premier League Productions. “No matter who they are even if they are ready-made international footballers, it is to make them better and what he is not afraid to do is look into their academy. “They have got a lot of good young players there. Bukayo Saka is the one that is coming to the front, and Gabriel Martinelli will eventually take over from Aubameyang [particularly] if they cannot keep hold of him [this summer].”

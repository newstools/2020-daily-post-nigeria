Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) on Sunday, announced that the result notification for candidates that sat for the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) is ready. This was confirmed in JAMB’s weekly bulletin by its Head of Media and Information, Fabian Benjamin. He said the results which had earlier been made available through SMS, can now be accessed and printed. It can be printed for free from the board’s website: www.jamb.gov.ng. “All a candidate needs to do after visiting the site is to click on QUICK LINKS, then on “E-Facility” where the candidate would be required to provide his/her registration details and the result notification slip would be displayed for printing,” part of the statement read. Benjamin also warned candidates to avoid fraudulent people posing as JAMB agents and that any attempt to forge the slip would attract stiff sanctions.

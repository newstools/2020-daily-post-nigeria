Manchester United have submitted a €100 million (£89m) offer to sign Barcelona youngster, Ansu Fati. According to the Spanish newspaper, Sport, Man United view Fati as a viable alternative to Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho, one of their priority targets for this summer’s transfer window. However, Barcelona is only willing to sell Fati if the player’s €170m (£151.5m) release clause is met. Fati came through Barcelona’s La Masia academy. The 17-year-old was the second-youngest player in history to make his senior debut for Barca earlier this season. He has made 24 appearances for the Catalan club so far this campaign. Speaking after Fati was promoted to Barcelona’s first team this season, the club’s captain, Lionel Messi said: “I like him, and I try to help and support him. “He’s an amazing player, and he is got what it takes to succeed.” “But if I look at it through my eyes, I would like them to bring him on gradually, as they did with me when I started, taking things nice and easy and without putting pressure on him.”

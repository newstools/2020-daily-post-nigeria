Police authorities in Anambra have arrested a 40-year-old man for brutally assaulting his niece, of nine years, who sustained injuries in all parts of her body as a result of the encounter. SP Haruna Mohammed, police spokesperson in the state who disclosed this to journalists in Anambra said the man, Hillary Apeh was arrested at 3-3 area of Onitsha following a tip-off by good spirited individuals in the neighbourhood. Haruna said, “On the 14/6/2020 at about 10:am, police operatives attached to 3-3 Police Station Onitsha arrested one Hillary Apeh ‘m’ aged 40 years of Maryland Estates 3-3 Onitsha. “Suspect brutally assaulted his niece, one Chioma Ogbu ‘f’ aged 9 years of the same address and inflicted several wounds on her body.” He added that preliminary investigations showed that the suspect had on previous occasions physically abused the victim and that these were evident in the scars all over her body. “Victim has been taken to the hospital for treatment while investigations are ongoing, after which the suspect would be brought to book.” It was, however, not clear what the offence of the girl was, but neighbours in the area told DAILY POST that it was not the first time the child had been manhandled by the man.

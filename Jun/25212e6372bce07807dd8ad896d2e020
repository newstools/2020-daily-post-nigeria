In its determined bid to control infectious diseases in the state, the Bauchi State government today inaugurated a molecular laboratory it built and equipped by the North-East Development Commission (NEDC) with supervision from the Nigeria Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC). Speaking while inaugurating the laboratory at the Bauchi State Specialist Hospital in Bauchi today, the state governor, Senator Bala Mohammed Abdulkadir, said the laboratory was built by the state government with a view to fast-tracking testing for infectious diseases. Governor Mohammed assured that the laboratory would be effectively put to use for the control of infectious diseases in the state. While saying that without quality health, no development can thrive in the society, Governor Mohammed emphasised his administration’s commitment to improving health care delivery in the state. According to the governor, the establishment of the laboratory was imperative as the state encountered difficulties in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the world. He stated that before now COVID-19 samples were taken to Abuja and later Jos, a development he described as cumbersome, stressing that with the establishment of the molecular laboratory in Bauchi, that issue of sample testing has been put to rest. “The establishment of the centre became necessary following the difficulties faced by officials of the state in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic considering that samples had to be taken to Abuja and later Jos for testing, a development that was too cumbersome. “I am happy for this groundbreaking ceremony in the state because our efforts as a government have paid off. “The NCDC was approached for permission while the NEDC took the responsibility of equipping the centre and the state provided the structure. He commended the committee saddled with the responsibility of implementing the establishment of the molecular laboratory in the state for doing a good job. Earlier in his speech on the occasion, the chairman of the centre implementation committee, Dr Ladan Salihu, commended the governor for ensuring that the establishment of the molecular laboratory in the state became a reality through his support and timely release of the required funding. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-810844 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200629-WA0033-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="494" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200629-WA0033-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200629-WA0033-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200629-WA0033.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"> Dr Salihu, who is the Chief of Staff to the governor, declared that with the commencement of operations of the molecular laboratory, Bauchi State has joined the league of the few states that have such a laboratory in the country. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-810845 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200629-WA0024-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="494" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200629-WA0024-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200629-WA0024-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200629-WA0024.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

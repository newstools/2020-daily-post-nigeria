President John Magufuli of Tanzania has declared his country coronavirus free. He announced this on Monday while attributing the acclaimed success over COVID-19 pandemic to prayers and fasting offered to God by the citizens. The President applauded the priest and worshippers for not wearing gloves and masks to protect themselves from the virus. Magufuli said, “It gives me joy to be a leader of a country that puts God first, God loves Tanzania. “The works of the devil will always be defeated in Tanzania because we love God and that is why even the coronavirus (COVID-19) has been defeated by God in our country.” Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has lamented over Tanzania’s government’s strategy on the pandemic. WHO accused the government of not publishing its data on the number of coronavirus cases in the country.

The Benin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has arrested a staff of First Bank of Nigeria Plc, Philips Orumade. He was picked up for allegedly stealing the sum of N18,900,000 from the bank. The staff was in charge of ATM gallery keys at Aduwawa branch of the bank. A statement on Tuesday by EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale, recalled that on November 3, 2019, the suspect allegedly disappeared with the said amount. Since then, efforts to trace him proved abortive. Oyewale noted that First Bank said the suspect was captured by the CCTV footage. “He was seen walking into the ATM gallery, before using a nylon bag to cover the CCTV. “The suspect has been on the run and was recently apprehended in Lagos,” EFCC said. The statement added that Orumade has made “useful statements.” He will be charged to court as soon as investigations are completed.

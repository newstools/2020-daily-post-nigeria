Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has admitted his side failed to match Liverpool’s desperation to win the Premier League title this season. City’s 2-1 defeat at Chelsea on Thursday, confirmed Liverpool as champions for the 2019/2020 season. It effectively ended Guardiola’s quest to win the league for a third consecutive year. Although, Kevin De Bruyne cancelled out Christian Pulisic’s solo effort, Fernandinho handled in the area and Willian dispatched a cool free-kick to win the match for Chelsea. “Maybe we didn’t arrive with the same passion; Liverpool played every single game like it was the last chance they have. “And maybe we didn’t get that moment, especially the key moments in the first part of the season. “That is the reality, that we are so far behind. Liverpool were fantastic in consistency throughout the whole season. “We dropped points at the beginning of the season, and Liverpool didn’t drop points. “We’ll have to recover for next season, to be more consistent, and recover the points we missed this season,” Guardiola told reporters after the game. City are away to Newcastle in the FA Cup on Sunday, before hosting champions Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday, July 2.

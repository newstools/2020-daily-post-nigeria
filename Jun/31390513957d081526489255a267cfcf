The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has declared that the All Progressives Congress, APC’s candidate for the Edo State governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, is not a match for any of its aspirants for the state governorship election. PDP claimed that Ize-Iyamu emerged as a candidate through the crudest governorship election primary ever, in the history of Nigeria. A statement by PDP’s spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the people of Edo State had written off the APC, and “turned the party into a butt of street joke as well as a new metaphor for disdain for the people.” The ruling party maintained that failure awaits APC during the upcoming governorship election in Edo State. Ologbondiyan said: “Already, on the streets of Edo state, Ize-Iyamu has become the new lexicon for APC’s crude attempt to suppress and lord it over the people of Edo State. “From all indications, only failure awaits the APC in the September election. This is because, going by the figures announced from the direct primary, which the APC conducted to produce Ize-Iyamu, it is clear that the totality of the members of the APC in Edo is far below 40,000, in a state where the membership and support base of the PDP soar well above three million.”

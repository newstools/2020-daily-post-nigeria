An Islamic group, Nastrul Lahil Fatih Society of Nigeria (NASFAT), has called for stricter penalties against gender-based violence in the country. Engr. Muhyideen Yusuf, the Chairman of NASFAT in Kaduna State, made the appeal in a statement on Saturday in Kaduna, NAN reports. Yusuf expressed concern over the escalation of gender-based violence against women and the girl-child in Nigeria and called for urgent action to stem it. According to him, the recent rape and gruesome murder of Vera Omozua, Barakat Bello, and many others were unacceptable. “This cruelty is alien to all faiths and cultures in our dear country, and we condemn this barbaric violence in all ramifications. “There are no excuses or any justifications whatsoever that is acceptable from the perpetrators of this cruelty. “We now call on all religious organizations, Civil Society Organizations, Non-Governmental Organizations and citizens to join hands with the government at all levels to stop these evils that have infested our society. “NASFAT prays for the repose of the souls of all departed victims of this violence and condoles with their families,” he said. Meanwhile, Nigerians, in the past few days, alongside prominent figures called for an end to rape in the country. The call became necessary after the murder of one Vera Omozuwa who was raped and killed by unknown people in a church in Benin.

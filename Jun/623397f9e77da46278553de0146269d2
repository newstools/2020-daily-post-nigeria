He said its recognition as a national holiday was a testament of APC’s appreciation of the huge significance of the day. The party assured that going forward, the Buhari government would, in words and actions, continue to promote and consolidate on the gains of democratic governance in the country. It said this is with a view to entrenching its finest ideals on our body polity. APC called on Nigerians to imbibe this spirit in the overall interest of the nation.

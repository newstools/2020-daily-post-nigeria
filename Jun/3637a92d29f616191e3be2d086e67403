Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State said churches and mosques should remain closed until further notice. The Governor said this on Friday while addressing newsmen at his Okemosan Governor’s office in Abeokuta. It would be recalled that the governor during his last briefing said June 19 has been picked tentatively for the reopening of worship centres, which have hitherto been closed to stop the spread of Coronavirus pandemic. However, Governor Abiodun said the situation of COVID-19 has not improved in Ogun State and Nigeria, saying the current regime of ease of lockdown should be maintained. He said the government has met with religious leaders in the state – the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and the League of Imams and Alfas, adding that they themselves advised that worship centres should remain closed. “We have taken the painful, but necessary decision to maintain the current regime of ease of lockdown in the meantime. “We are consequently suspending our initial reopening of churches and mosques. Let me thank our religious leaders who by themselves advised that this is the best decision to be taken at this time in the best interest of all of us,” Abiodun said. The governor said this decision was taken “after a careful review of the data, feedback from the field, experts’ opinion and lessons from far and near.” He thanked religious leaders for their cooperation, forthrightness and even “appreciation of the fact that the curve of the pandemic is worsening and places of worship represent the most potent vital ground for the spread of this deadly virus.”

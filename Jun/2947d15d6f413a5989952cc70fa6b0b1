The title chase resumes in Spain today, with Barcelona and Real Madrid ready to slug it out for the LaLiga crown. Football has been on hold for more than three months, but the Seville Derby on Thursday meant that the Spanish top flight is back in business. Barca travel to Mallorca in Saturday’s late kick-off, only two points ahead of Real. The Catalans’ advantage was cut by Zinedine Zidane’s side before the lockdown, when they lost 2-0 in the El Clasico. Both Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid are back in action Sunday, against Athletic Bilbao and Eibar respectively. Atleti are currently in sixth place, 13 points off the leaders, having won only 11 games so far.

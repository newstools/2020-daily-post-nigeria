Nigeria’s Attorney-General, Abubakar Malami, swore in All Progressive Congress (APC) Caretaker Chairman, Mala Buni, inside Aso Villa, because he is a lawyer and law officer. This is the perspective of the Chairman of Progressives Governors Forum, Atiku Bagudu. The Kebbi Governor insisted that Malami never violated any law contrary to critics’ arguments. He stated that the AGF complied with Nigeria’s constitution in inaugurating Buni, the Governor of Yobe State. In a chat with newsmen, Atiku Bagudu said nothing stops Malami, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), from administering the oath of office. He reiterated that Malami administered the oath as a law officer, “and if the opposition party invites him for such action, he will definitely discharge his duty as a SAN”. The governor added that the minister “belonged to a political party before becoming a minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria”. Earlier in his defence, Malami explained that his office exercises dual functions inclusive of the Minister of Justice. He said the portfolio carries out political and advisory tasks and that “administration of justice is one of such functions”. Malami explained that a federation embodies the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary with a possible expansion to accommodate private, corporate and associated entities. He declared that it would not be out of place for an AGF to administer an oath on any one inclusive of the leadership of any political party. The minister stressed that a lawyer, a judge, a legal practitioner and a commissioner for oath “are recognized statutorily as people vested with the power to administer an oath”.

The All Progressives Congress, APC in Edo State has recommended Gov Godwin Obaseki to the National Working Committee, NWC, for total expulsion. Others recommended for expulsion are Anselm Ojezua and Dr Aisosa Amadasun. Briefing newsmen in Benin City, the state capital on Sunday, the factional chairman, Col David Imuse (rtd) said it became necessary for the State Working Committee under him to recommend the three of them for total expulsion over alleged anti-party activities and in violation of articles 21, sub-section D5 of the APC construction in several court cases. According to him, ‘Godwin Obaseki, Anselm Ojezua and some other persons have gone to court, violating articles 21, sub-section D5 of the APC construction They have shipped for injunctions and rulings to circumvent the process of law and provisions of our party constitution in defiance of democratic norms. ” In the light of this, the State Working Committee of the APC in Edo State have recommended to the NWC that Goodwin Obaseki, Anselm Ojezua and Dr Aisosa Amadasun should be expelled for violating the provisions of our constitution’ “After the bitter experience of losing the governorship of Bayelsa State in the court after a well-deserved victory in the election, it would be foolhardy to allow a candidate with dodgy and faulty academic credential to fly out party’s flag in the September 19th 2020 elections. Even the holy book admonishes us that affliction shall not arise a second time; wisdom we are told is profitable to direct,” he added. Col Imuse, however, appreciated members of the APC in Edo State for their resolute determination to uphold the mantra of the party. Reacting via a telephone interview, Anselm Ojazua who claimed he was in Irrua said ”the activity was an illegal contraction and that Imuse has been served with contempt proceeding in the law court, and we are proceeding with his trial, I’m the state chairman of APC,” he added. The Special Adviser to the governor on Media and Communication strategy, Mr Crusoe Osagie did not respond to several calls put across to him by our reporter.

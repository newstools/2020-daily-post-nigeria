Northern Governors Forum (NGF) has set up a committee to engage local vigilantes, hunters and community groups on intelligence gathering, rapid response and sustained surveillance in the region. The Chairman and Plateau Governor, Simon Lalong, said this in a statement by his spokesmen, Makut Macham on Friday in Jos. The action was part of the resolutions of the Northern Governors during a teleconference meeting held on Thursday. Chaired by Lalong, the committee would also consult with traditional, religious and community leaders in the North, to strengthen their involvement in tackling security challenges. A standing committee on security, headed by Kogi Governor, Yahaya Bello, was also set up to foster synergy between security agencies in the enforcement of security measures in the region. The Forum urged the Federal Government to closely look into the ECOWAS protocol on the free movement of persons, facilitating cross-border movement of herders from other countries into Nigeria. It hailed security agencies for their efforts and called for increased synergy to further enhance their operations. The Forum sympathised with victims of various attacks and other forms of criminality in the region and also appealed to groups affected for calm. “The state governments and the federal government are working together to forestall reoccurrence,’’ Lalong stated.

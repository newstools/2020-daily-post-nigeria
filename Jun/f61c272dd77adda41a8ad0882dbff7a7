Olaide Owolai Adelami, one of the All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship aspirants for the forthcoming Ondo State election, has raised the alarm over rising security threats in the state ahead of the party’s primary. The governorship aspirant expressed his concerns in a statement issued by the Adelami Lamilaka Campaign Organisation on Tuesday in Abuja and signed by Segun Ogodo. He blamed the incumbent government in the state for the breakdown of security, expressing fears that lives may be lost during the exercise. The aspirant alleged that topshots in the politics of the State appear to be aiding and abetting gross insecurity particularly in Owo, where he hails from. The statement said that for quite some times, Owo community has been living under palpable fears, adding that guns and other dangerous weapons are being openly displayed even in the day time without any confrontations from security agents. ‘The police seem to be helpless as they complain of no operational vehicle for them to respond to emergencies. The questions people are asking is that could this be deliberate? “Whose responsibility is it to provide essential working tools for security operatives in the state? “In spite of the huge security votes at the disposal of the governor to be used in securing lives and property of the people, it is now used to molest and harass perceived opponents,” Adelami said. He said the general public must be notified that there is no security in Owo community and to further note that killing and kidnapping of party stalwarts may not be far from the nefarious activities of this killer squad. “The task, for them, became necessary as there are about six aspirants contesting against Mr Governor in his hometown, Owo,” he added.

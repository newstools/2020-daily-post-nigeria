A former Governor of Rivers State and Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi has said that anyone who does not adhere to Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) rules will not be allowed to enter a train when they are reopened. Amaechi stated this in a tweet via his official Twitter page on Saturday. He also said that trains would not move if passengers do not comply with rules amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “We’re not in a hurry to start train operations because of the danger of COVID-19 spreading. “When we start, all health and safety protocols must apply. “You will not enter a train if you don’t adhere to our rules. “The train will not move if passengers do not comply,” Amaechi tweeted. DAILY POST had reported that NRC had suspended passengers’ train services in the country since March 23. The NRC Deputy Director Public Relations, Mr Yakub Mahmood, made this known on behalf of the Board and Management of the corporation in Lagos. He said that the suspension was in view of the report of the already known COVID-19 outbreak.

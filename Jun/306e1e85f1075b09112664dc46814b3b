Former US national security advisor, John Bolton, has claimed that President Donald Trump pleaded with China’s leader Xi Jinping for help to win re-election in 2020. Bolton, Donald Trump’s former aide, made the claim in the excerpts of his explosive new book published Wednesday. Bolton said that the US President met with Chinese President, Xi at a summit last June and “stunningly turned the conversation to the US presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win.” The excerpts were published by The Washington Post, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The former presidential aide wrote that his former principal stressed the importance of America’s farmers and how “increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat” could impact the electoral outcome in the US.

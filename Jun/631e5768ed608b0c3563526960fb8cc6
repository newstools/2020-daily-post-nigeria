I know that I would probably disappoint a few people and that’s Okay, I know that my fans don’t want to hear this but guess what I am never too far away from you, trust me. “The reason why I had to leave the industry is because I needed to choose my life, the music industry is demonic.

She, however added that though she has exited the music industry, she would still perform to entertain her fans. “Now my fans are probably asking themselves right now; Are you gonna never sing again or perform?

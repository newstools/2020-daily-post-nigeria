Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has revealed how he convinced the club’s new signing, Timo Werner, to snub a move to Liverpool for the Blues. Chelsea officially completed the signing of Werner for £53 million from Bundesliga club, RB Leipzig last week, seeing off competition from Liverpool. The 24-year-old striker will link up with the rest of Chelsea’s teammates at Stamford Bridge next month. But Rudiger has now disclosed that he was in constant dialogue with his fellow compatriot throughout the COVID-19 lockdown in a bid to persuade him to join Frank Lampard’s side ahead of Liverpool. “Like everyone, I am very excited that he’s chosen Chelsea and I am looking forward to working with him,” Rudiger told Chelsea’s website. “I have known Timo Werner since he was 17, and he did very well in the past few years. He can be very important for us. “I did speak to him before because we have known each other for a long time. “We spoke a lot during the lockdown, and he told me he was interested in coming to England. Of course, then I did my bit, what I had to do. “I would say he is a quiet, humble guy, always ready to do better. “I hope he adapts very quickly when he comes because as we all know, this competition is different from others.”

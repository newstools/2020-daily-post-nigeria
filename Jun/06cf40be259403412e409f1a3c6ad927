Babatunde Fashola, Minister of works has reacted to the flight saga of mistaken identity with Naira Marley. The Executive Jets Chairman, Sam Iwuajoku, who flew Naira Marley to Abuja for a concert, had apologized to the federal government. The apology came after the federal government on Monday suspended its operations. Iwuajoku, in a letter sent to the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, said the airline airlifted Naira Marley after mixing up his identity with Minister Fashola Babatunde. Reacting, Fashola in a statement on Tuesday by his Special Adviser on Communications, Hakeem Bello, described Iwuajoku’s statement as ridiculous. His statement read: “The attention of the Office of the Honourable Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola SAN, has been drawn to a letter signed by the Chairman/CEO of Executive Jets Services Limited regarding a flight it operated to Abuja. “For purposes of clarity and in order to set the records straight, the Hon. Minister of Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola SAN, has not travelled out of Abuja since March 22, 2020 before the lockdown. He added that Fashola has not travelled since the Government’s ban on inter-state movement. “It is therefore ridiculous for Dr Iwuajoku to attempt to link the Hon. Minister with any non-compliant flight,” the statement added.

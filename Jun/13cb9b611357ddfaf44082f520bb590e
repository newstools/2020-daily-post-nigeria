Providing an update on Awoniyi, Mainz disclosed that the 22-year-old would spend the night in the hospital as a precautionary measure. “Our striker Taiwo Awoniyi suffered a concussion in his collision with Augsburg’s Felix Uduokhai and is spending the night in the hospital as a precautionary measure,” Mainz wrote on Twitter. “Get well soon, Taiwo!” Awoniyi is currently on loan at Mainz from Liverpool. He joined the Premier League giants in 2015 but has not made an appearance for Jurgen Klopp’s men.

By the 1st of October this year, our compatriots will be celebrating 60 years of our nationhood. Indeed, we’ve come a long way together and this period offers us an opportunity to reflect on the journey so far — the challenges that we have faced (and are still facing) and the opportunities that stare us in the face. In all of these, we will be presented with choices — to start a pity-party about our socio-political challenges (which everyone already knows), to weep over all of our missed opportunities. Or we will be presented with the choice of re-writing the wrongs and weaving together a future that posterity will be grateful for; a future that we will be a part of as much as the kind that is solid enough to support the dreams of the next generation. It has been said that great men plant trees whose shade they know that they wouldn’t seat under and as we may have heard the saying that, the best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago (or even 60, as in our case), but the next best time is now. We will need to get our acts together and join the league of nations who are on the forward march. That’s what we deserve. We will roll our sleeves and build together — leaders and citizens alike. We will use all of the tools of developments that we can muster and leverage technology to leap-frog in our forward march. It’s also our belief that all hands must be on deck for the work of nation-building to succeed and therefore, we would be calling on all stakeholders to come together, irrespective of tribal, religious, or political affiliations to make our nation work, even at this auspicious moment. I am Nigeria. You are Nigeria. We are Nigeria. Nigeria needs us!

The All Progressives Congress, APC, Edo State chapter has refuted the news making the rounds that a federal high court sitting in Benin ordered the seal off of its office. Reacting to the rumour via a phone interview, the state Publicity Secretary, Mr Chris Azebamwan told DAILYPOST that the party Secretariat remains under the control of Col David Imuse and has been active all through including today. ‘My brother there is nothing like that, you can go and check/see the party Secretariat yourself if in doubt’ Reports had earlier filtered in that the State Secretariat of Oshiomhole-backed faction of the Edo APC was sealed off after an order from a Federal High Court in Benin. A visit to the said Secretariat at about 4:35pm on Wednesday revealed that the environment was not under lock and key, as gatemen stationed at the premises were seen performing their normal despite the gates being closed. The gatemen told DAILYPOST that there was nothing like that even as they maintained that none of the party officers was on ground as they had left after officer hour.

The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has confirmed that the Deputy Governor of Ondo, Agboola Ajayi, has joined the party. PDP made the confirmation on Twitter Sunday evening. “Hon. Agboola after his resignation, picked the @OfficialPDPNig membership card at Ward 2, Apoi, in Ese Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State”, it tweeted. Ajayi dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) today. This development lays to rest speculations about his political future. It is now clear that Ajayi will seek the PDP governorship ticket to run against Governor Rotimi Akeredolu.

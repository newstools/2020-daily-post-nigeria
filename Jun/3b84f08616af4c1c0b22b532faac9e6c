President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday sought the confirmation of Monica Dongban-Mensem as the President of the Court of Appeal. Buhari’s request was conveyed in a letter addressed to President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan and read at the plenary. Recall that President Buhari on Monday nominated Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem as President of the Court of Appeal. Justice Mensem is a serving Justice of the Court of Appeal and was recommended by the National Judicial Council. The letter from the President reads: “Pursuant to Section 238(1) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), I write to request for confirmation by the Senate, the appointment of Honourable Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem as the President of the Court of Appeal of Nigeria. “It is my hope that the Senate will consider and confirm the nominee in the usual expeditious manner.”

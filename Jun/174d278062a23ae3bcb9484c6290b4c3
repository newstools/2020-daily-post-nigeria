Chelsea FC are reportedly lining up a stunning bid to sign Bayern Munich’s David Alaba this summer’s transfer window. According to The Athletic, Chelsea has approached the Bundesliga champions over a shock move for Alaba. Chelsea views Alaba as an alternative to Leicester City left-back, Ben Chilwell. The Blues manager, Frank Lampard had been looking to prise Chilwell from Leicester. But the Foxes’ £70million valuation of the England star has put Chelsea off. DAILY POST recalls that Alaba had drawn the interest of Chelsea in the past. Alaba’s current deal at Bayern will expire next summer. Bayern will consider selling the Austrian international at the end of the season to ensure they get some money in.

Liverpool have announced that eight players will be released by the club on June 30. Former Southampton defender, Nathaniel Clyne, makes the list. Clyne has not made any appearance for the Reds this season and has only featured 10 times in the previous three seasons. His time at Anfield has been hampered by injury and the emergence of Trent Alexander-Arnold’s breakthrough. The 29-year-old is on a list of players to depart, which also includes academy youngsters. Dan Atherton, Isaac Christie-Davies, Shamal George, Kai McKenzie-Lyle, Jack Walls, Alex Turner and Abel Rodrigues will all also be leaving the club. A club statement read: “They will do so with the gratitude of everyone at the club for their service and best wishes for the future.”

Former Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, is not dead. There were reports making the rounds Thursday evening that Ajimobi reportedly died from complications arising from COVID-19. But his media aide, Bolaji Tunji took to his Facebook page to debunk the news. He urged the public to disregard the rumours, saying that Ajimobi is still alive. His post read: “Kindly disregard all the rumours, just rumours. In all, we remain prayerful.” Meanwhile, two days ago, Ajimobi was appointed as the Acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-806242" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/unnamed-1.jpg" alt="" width="573" height="508" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/unnamed-1.jpg 573w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/unnamed-1-300x266.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px">

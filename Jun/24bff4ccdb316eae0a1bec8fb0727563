The 24-hour curfew imposed on Zangon Kataf and Kauru Chiefdoms have been extended to the entire two local government areas in Kaduna State. The Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, in a statement, said the security agencies were working to contain the situation that started as a clash over farmland. He explained that extending the curfew to cover the entire two local government areas was part of step taken by the state government to manage tensions and maintain peace in the councils. Recall that there is a dispute of land ownership between the Atyap communities and Hausa-Fulani that nearly led to a clash last week in the area. Report had it that the discovery of a corpse of one Yusuf Shehu Magaji at a riverbank in the boundary between Zangon Kataf and Kauru local government areas on Thursday in the morning led to serious tension in the area. The deployment of joint Security Task Force in the area has helped to restore calm.

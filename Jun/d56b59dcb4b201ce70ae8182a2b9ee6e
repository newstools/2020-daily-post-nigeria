The President of Lille FC, Gerard Lopez, has confirmed that the club received several offers for striker, Victor Osimhen. According to Lopez, Lille also turned down offers for the Nigerian international from English and Spanish clubs in the last January transfer window. “There are multiple offers for [Victor Osimhen],” Lopez told Sportsmail. “We turned down one English and one Spanish offer this January transfer window. “There is a wide array this summer, and I would not want to give the names of the clubs who are bidding but what I can tell you is that there are multiple offers for him. “There are three championships that have clubs that have bid for him.” DAILY POST recalls that Osimhen had drawn the interest of Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Liverpool, and Manchester United in the past. The 21-year-old’s current contract with Lille will expire at the end of the 2023/2024 season. Osimhen, who recently lost his dad, is expected to cost around £70 million. He scored 18 goals in his debut season for the French Ligue club before the league was ended prematurely due to COVID-19 pandemic.

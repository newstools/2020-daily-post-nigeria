UEFA President, Aleksander Ceferin, has revealed what will happen to any player demanding justice for George Floyd, an American, during matches in UEFA’s competitions. Floyd, 46, died on May 25, 2020, at the hands of a White police officer in Minneapolis. DAILY POST recalls that football players, including Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, used last weekend matches in the Bundesliga to reveal messages expressing solidarity with Floyd. “Football is a sport which encourages tolerance, inclusion and justice,” Ceferin was quoted by Daily Star as saying. “These are the same values being espoused by those showing solidarity to George Floyd. “If a player in our competitions were to display a message or act symbolically to ask for equality for human beings the circumstances around the event should be taken into account in line with UEFA’s zero-tolerance against racism.” Meanwhile, FIFA has already urged football competition organizers to apply ‘common sense’ and consider not sanctioning players demanding justice for Floyd, during games.

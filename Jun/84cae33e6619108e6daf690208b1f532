The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has said there will be a 100 per cent increase on passenger service charges on domestic and international flight tickets from August 1, 2020. FAANâ€™s Managing Director, Rabiu Yadudu, revealed in a letter to airlines, with reference FAAN/HQ/MD/18E/VOL.86/72. According to Yadudu, the decision has been approved by the Ministry of Aviation. This means passengers will now pay N2,000 instead of N1,000 for domestic flights. International flyers will now pay $100 instead of $50. This increment could also lead to a rise in airfares on local and international tickets.

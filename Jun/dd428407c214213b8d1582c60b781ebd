Men’s world number one tennis player, Novak Djokovic, has tested positive for COVID-19. Djokovic confirmed the diagnosis in a statement on Tuesday. The 33-year-old Serbian said that his wife, Jelena, also tested positive for coronavirus, but his children are negative. The statement read in part: “The moment we arrived in Belgrade we went to be tested. “My result is positive, just as Jelena’s, while the results of our children are negative. “Everything we did in the past month, we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions.” Recall that Djokovic held a tennis tournament in Croatia last week, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Djokovic is now the fourth tennis player to have tested positive for COVID-19 after Borna Coric, Grigor Dimitrov and Viktor Troicki.

Former Liverpool star, Steve Nicol, has revealed Chelsea’s biggest problem under their manager, Frank Lampard, so far this season. According to Nicol, the Blues’ biggest problem under their Lampard was the vulnerability of their defence. On Sunday, Chelsea came from a goal down to beat Aston Villa 2-1 in the Premier League to move five points clear ahead of fifth-place Manchester United. “Chelsea’s biggest problem is not going forward, it’s defensively,” Nicol told ESPN FC. “They are going to create chances and put teams under pressure all day long, every time they step onto the field, regardless of the opposition. “But I tell you what, and they give me a heart attack at the back. “They go a goal down, and there were three Aston Villa players who could have put the ball in the net.” Chelsea’s next Premier League clash is against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.

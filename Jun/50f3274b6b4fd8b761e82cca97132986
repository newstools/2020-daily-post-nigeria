UEFA on Wednesday confirmed that Lisbon will host the final of this year’s Champions League. This decision was reached at a meeting of UEFA’s executive committee. The final stages of the 2019/2020 will also be played in the Portugal capital instead of Istanbul, which was the initial choice. The Champions League will be completed as a mini-competition from the quarter-final onward, with Benfica’s Estadio da Luz and Sporting’s Estadio Jose Alvalade to host the games. The mini-tournament will run from August 12-23, with the round-of-16 matches completed August 7-8. “I am delighted that we are able to resume almost all of our competitions. “I am confident that we will not have to endure the fans’ absence for long and that they will be allowed into stadiums sooner rather than later,” UEFA President, Aleksander Ceferin, told the official website.

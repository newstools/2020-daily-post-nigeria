A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Mr. Yekini Nabena, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to call for the party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) emergency meeting to address the leadership crisis rocking the party. Nabena, who is also the party’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, said this on Saturday at a news conference in Abuja. NAN reports that the ruling party’s National Working Committee (NWC), has been divided into factions, each claiming leadership of the party. The crisis followed the Appeal Court ruling affirming the suspension of Mr. Adams Oshiomhole as the party’s National Chairman. “At least 4 people are laying claim to the chairmanship of the APC following the court-ordered suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. “All manner of Court cases and orders are flying around contesting party decisions and the National Working Committee’s position. “Factions are decaying at the national level and many states. The party is clearly at a tipping point. “The several court cases and orders over the national leadership of the party have put APC in a standstill and is a legal threat to forthcoming elections in Edo and Ondo States. “President Muhammadu Buhari is the leader of APC, and it has become imperative for him to convene an emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee. “This is to find solutions to the crisis and chart a way forward,” Nabena said.

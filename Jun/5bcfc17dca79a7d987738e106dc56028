Chelsea are under pressure to wrap up the signing of Timo Werner from RB Leipzig this weekend or the deal may never happen, the UK Mirror reports. The Premier League side was hoping to announce the transfer this week, after beating Liverpool to the player. The Blues are willing to pay the £50 million release clause in Werner’s current contract and have been in advanced negotiations with the German. However, Werner’s release clause expires on Monday, meaning Chelsea have just two days to seal the deal. A medical for the 24-year-old is proving to be tricky, with the COVID-19 regulations in both Germany and the UK. If all of that is not sorted by Monday, Leipzig could raise Werner’s fee and Chelsea might lose out.

The Nigeria police has again sealed off the All Progressives Congress national secretariat in Abuja. Recall that the police took over the secretariat two days ago and chased out staff from their offices. The same scenario played out on Thursday morning, DAILY POST gathered. It was observed that the Inspector General of Police ordered the police action as two patrol vehicles were stationed in front of the main entrance. This is coming few hours to the commencement of the virtual NEC meeting of the party, convened by Victor Giadom, who is laying claim to being the acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress. Recall that Giadom was on Wednesday backed by President Muhammadu Buhari, who said he will be present at the virtual meeting. The party’s National Working Committee (NWC) however, maintained it will boycott the meeting, as it will amount to, “embracing illegalities and turning a blind eye to the infractions on the constitution of the party.”

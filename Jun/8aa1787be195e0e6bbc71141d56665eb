The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, on Thursday night, met with state governors, to discuss the level of compliance with guidelines nationwide. Chairman of the PTF, Boss Mustapha, confirmed this while speaking to the media during their daily briefing earlier in the day. Mustapha appealed to state governments to ensure compliance with the set protocols, which would stop the transmission of COVID-19. “The PTF continues to monitor the level of activities and compliance with the guidelines nationwide. “Consultations will continue and tonight, I will be holding another round of video conference with the team of governors appointed by the National Economic Council to interface with the PTF,” he said. Mustapha also said PTF will meet with the heads of security agencies, “to enforce the guidelines and protocols firmly” and “further fine-tune strategies to ensure compliance.” By Friday morning, Nigeria had hit 14,554 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Lagos, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Kano State have the highest number with 6611, 1097 and 1048 cases respectively.

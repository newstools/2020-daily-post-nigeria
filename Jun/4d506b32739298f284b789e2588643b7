The opposition Action Peoples Party,(APP), has demanded the immediate release of its National Chairman, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, who was arrested and detained by men of the Nigeria Police. The demand was contained in a statement jointly signed by Conference of South East Chairmen of Action Peoples Party, (APP). The signatories were, Engr. Ajala Kingsley(Abia), Chinedum Elekwachi,(Ebonyi), Hon. Ezirim Ernest(Imo), Foster Eneh,(Enugu), and CSP Lawrence Donya, rtd, (Anambra). Recall that Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, who also doubled as the spokesman of the opposition Coalition of United Political Parties, (CUPP), was arrested by the Nigeria police at his residence in Abuja, in connection with the allegation of bribery made against the House of Representatives and the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila. His arrest happened despite a Federal High Court in Abuja, on June 4, restricting the police and the Department of State Services, DSS, from arresting the opposition party’s spokesman. Ikenga Ugochinyere had accused the House of Representatives of bribery over the infectious disease bill. The House of Reps has since denied the allegation and had invited the CUPP boss to appear before it. He, however, sent his lawyer and did not appear in person. However, APP, in the statement made available to newsmen, on Saturday, in Umuahia, the Abia State capital, condemned the arrest in its entirety and described the action of the police as subversion to freedom of speech. According to the political party, “Our leader has proven to be a voice to common Nigerians as we have seen him on different occasions challenging and questioning government polices that are not in tandem with conventional projection of good governance procedures. “The rule of law should be followed in prosecuting him if found guilty of any crime as the current detention suffered by him is an assault to his personality and in total breach of his fundamental human right, “it added.

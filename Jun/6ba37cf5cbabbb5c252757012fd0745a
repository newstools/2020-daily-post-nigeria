A Peoples Democratic Party, PDP governorship aspirant, Mr. Valentine Ozigbo says he will offer his best to Anambra State when he becomes governor as the state allegedly lacked quality governance. Ozigbo, who addressed journalists in a zoom conference on Thursday said he is coming into the contest, fully prepared, and hopes to offer the state the best of leadership. He expressed optimism that he would win the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP for the contest which is to be held in November next year. “Anambra lacks quality leadership. The last time we had it was when Mr Peter Obi was governor of the state. I am the most qualified for the position of governor of Anambra State, among all those contesting for the position, and I will offer the state quality leadership. “I have a verifiable past, and everyone knows the legacy I left behind as President of Transcorp. Before going to Transcorp, I had a glowing career in banking, spanning 17 years, and my achievements are verifiable.” Speaking on the zoning of the governorship position to the southern zone where he hails, Ozigbo said that it was in the interest of the PDP to follow the popular view of the people by zoning the ticket to Anambra South Senatorial zone. But he maintained his ground that he was not contesting as a result of the zoning arrangement, rather, to give quality leadership to the state, which he said yearns for one. “I have the goodwill of PDP leaders in this State. They’ve linked me with Peter Obi, Chief Chris Uba, Prince Nicholas Ukachukwu and a host of others and it shows I’m the most popular here ” “I will win the PDP primary election and become the next governor of the state by the grace of God,” he said.

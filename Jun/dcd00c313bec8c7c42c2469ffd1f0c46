A woman, who identified herself as Tolu Adesh, has shared a video, wherein she claimed she was beaten by an officer of the Ogun State COVID-19 task force for violating the Coronavirus lockdown order of the state government. DAILY POST reports that there is usually a total lockdown on Saturdays and Sundays in Ogun State, as directed by Governor Dapo Abiodun. But the woman claimed to be a resident of Lagos State, who was coming into Ogun State to buy a bicycle for her children’s 7th birthday. The woman said she and her husband were accosted by the task force from Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State. According to her a sum of N15,000 was demanded as fine for violating the lockdown order. DAILY POST reports that the refusal of the woman to pay the fine led to her harassment by an officer of the local government. Her words, “This afternoon, on my way to #justritestores in Ojodu to buy a bicycle for my daughter whose 7th birthday is in 2 weeks, we were stopped at the intersection between Lagos and Ogun State (which isn’t properly marked) by Ogun state task force officials, who informed us that there was total lockdown in Ogun State during weekends and since we were in their territory, we had to get a pass from their local government office, which is about 3 minutes away. “They seized my husband’s ID card and requested that we drive them to the office. We refused to pick them in the car because of the #COVID-19 situation and they got really upset. “I agreed to walk with the officer while my husband drove behind us to their office. When we arrived, we were handed over to the man in the video who told us we would pay a fine of N15,000.00 for disobeying the lockdown that was in place. “We explained that we didn’t live in Ogun State and weren’t aware of the lockdown and asked to be pardoned so we could go home. I started recording because I saw that my pleas were falling on deaf ears while the officer called a guy to deflate our tyres. “While recording, the man began to beat me. I am calling on Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun and other government agencies to see how the officials they have put in the office are treating citizens. “The man beat me, kicked me, pushed me and punched me because of N15, 000.00.” Meanwhile, the Transition Committee Chairman of Ifo Local Government, Hon. Fola Salami said his attention has been drawn to the viral video, which he described as a case of assault on the lady, saying it happened at Ojodu Abiodun Area of the Local Government. Salami said it “came as a rude shock to me when I saw the video of one of our officials enforcing the lockdown order with gross inhumane attitude.” He spoke further: “His attitude does not portray the humane nature popularly preached by Ifo Local Government. “On this note, I am suspending all officials involved without pay, until further notice. “Rest assured, the public should be aware that all hands are on deck on this issue and whoever is found guilty will be dealt with decisively. “Meanwhile, as at the time of this release, the primary official involved has been arrested.” <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1gOPS__8Bfo/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Woman harassed by Ogun task force for violating lockdown order">

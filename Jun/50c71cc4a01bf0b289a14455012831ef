The All Progressives Congress, APC, Kwara State on Friday condemned the purported defection of some members of the party to the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party in the state describing it as a mirage. The state APC spokesman, Tajudeen Folaranmi Aro, in a statement in Ilorin, said “this claim by the PDP is of doubtful success, laughable and a terrible absurdity.” According to him, ” it would have been impossible to assemble 10,000 defectors in any location at this period of COVID-19 pandemic without the attention of the public. “The APC ruling party in Kwara State is taking democratic dividends to the door steps of Kwara people with the giant strides in strategic infrastructural development. “We recognise the people as our primary constituency and we are prepared to build a greater and prosperous Kwara State,”he added. Aro described the leader of the decampees , Alhaji Manzuma Abdulmalik Dogo, as “inconsequential and insignificant to cause any discomfort for the APC in the state or bouy the image of the PDP, which is now becoming more and more hopeless in its future.” He said the PDP has resorted to falsehoods and psychological campaigns, erroneously thinking that such will shore up its rapidly dwindling image. He advised the public to discard the antics of the opposition PDP which is determined to take advantage of the crisis in the APC to paint a false image of its acceptability.

The National Association of Resident Doctors at the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital, UPTH, has said they will not join the nationwide strike as declared by the national body. President of resident doctors at UPTH, Samuel Ameh, while addressing newsmen in Port Harcourt, said the decision was in the best interest of residents of the state. He added that the leadership of NMA is working with the federal government on modalities to meet the demands. “Let it be on record that we will not be embarking on strike as a local chapter. The reasons are not far-fetched. It has to do with the fact that we understand that the leadership of the NMA is already negotiating with the Federal government to fashion out modalities to actualise some of our demands and the fact that we also recognise the peculiarity of the situation here in UPTH and the Country at large. “Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and the panic it has created we realised that all health workers, including doctors, are playing an a=essential role in helping to stem the tide of the COVID-19 and to reduce the direct of the pandemic on all patients in the country. “We fully agree with the demands made by Nigeria Association of Resident Doctors. However; putting everything together, we realise that it will not be in the best interest of the general population, especially those in Rivers State,” Ameh said. The National Association of Resident Doctors of Nigeria Monday announced the commencement nationwide strike. President of the association, Dr. Aliyu Sokomba, said the provision of adequate appropriate personal protective equipment for all healthcare workers is among other numerous demands of NARD from the Federal government.

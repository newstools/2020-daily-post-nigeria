Bank customers on Wednesday revived an elderly man, who collapsed while on a queue to withdraw cash at an ATM point in Asaba, Delta State. Many of the bank customers, who had initially scampered for safety due to the ravaging Coronavirus pandemic, returned to assist the man and succeeded in reviving him. The man, who declined to disclose his names, told sympathizers that he was ill and had just returned from the hospital. “I am not feeling too well. I am coming from the hospital and decided to stop over and use the ATM. “I am a diabetic patient. I live in Ibusa with my family. I came to Asaba for treatment,” he said NAN reports that the man was later assisted by some sympathizers to contact his wife on phone since he could barely walk.

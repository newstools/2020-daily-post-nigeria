Anambra State council of the Nigeria Union of Journalist, NUJ, has raised the alarm over a journalist, Mr Mathew Onwuasoanya, who is said to have gone missing. The state chairman of the union, Mr. Emma Ifesinachi, in a statement quoted the Managing Director of Anambra Newspapers and Printing Corporation, ANPC, publishers of National, Mr. Chuka Nnabuife as saying that the journalist who works with the company was last seen on May 29. Nnabuife, in a letter to NUJ announcing Oneuasoanya’s disappearance said, “Barrister Mathew Onwuasoanya, male, fair in complexion, aged 49, personal telephone numbers, 07086738854 and 07032770194 has not been seen neither in office nor at his residence in Ngodo, Nise, since the night of Friday, May 29, 2020. “We have been expecting him at work until his only brother, Mr. Oliver Onwuasoanya, 07031318440, arrived our office on Monday, June 8, 2020 and told us they are searching for him. “Thereafter, we commenced action in search of him. His brother has lodged complaints to CPS and the CP’s office with his photograph and vital information. “At his residence, neighbours told his brother that at about 2 am on May 30, some vehicles, comprising a white Hilux truck and a Highlander with some gun-bearing men dressed in what looks like security men’s uniform came and whisked him away. That is the much they said. “Kindly use your good office to help rescue this very active and resourceful journalist as the development if not tackled may live a big dent on the image of media practice in Anambra State.”

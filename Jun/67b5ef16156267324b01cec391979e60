Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on Tuesday sacked Mr Allen Sowore, Special Assistant on New Media to the embattled Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi. Akeredolu announced the decision in a statement issued on Tuesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Olusegun Ajiboye. Recall that Agboola Ajayi had been at loggerheads with his boss, Akeredolu, before he finally resigned from the All Progressives Congress, APC, and joined the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Ajayi had maintained that he remains the Deputy Governor of the state despite his resignation from the All Progressives Congress. NAN reports that the statement advised Sowore to submit all governmentâ€™s property in his possession to the Chief of Staff to the Governor with immediate effect.

The patient, a female was said to be a trader selling second-hand clothes popularly known as ‘okrika’ in the market. It was gathered that the patient had been diagnosed with the deadly disease in Imo State before she travelled down to Akure, the Ondo State capital without submitting herself for treatment. Confirming the development, the state Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro explained that the escape of the patient prompted both the Imo and Ondo Governments to mount surveillance for her. The tracking eventually paid off when she was traced to Oja-Oba where she was eventually picked up. She was caught where she was selling second-hand wares popularly called ‘okrika’ at the market. Dr. Adegbenro disclosed that contact tracing of the patient’s family, friends, and neighbours had begun and urged all who had transacted business with the woman to report for diagnosis.

A former Manchester United midfielder, Phil Neville, has insisted that the club only needed one more signing this summer’s transfer window to challenge for the Premier League title again. Man United have not won the Premier League title since the departure of former manager, Sir Alex Ferguson in 2013. The Old Trafford club has not even come close to winning the English top-flight league or UEFA Champions League in the last seven years. The Red Devils are below Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea in English football’s pecking order currently. However, Man United has invested wisely in the transfer market over the last year in a bid to revive the past glories. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side, who have improved significantly in the second half of the 2019-2020 campaign, signed Daniel James, Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Odion Ighalo (loan). But Neville thinks that gap can be closed significantly if Solskjaer adds one more key player to his squad, as long as midfielder, Paul Pogba, remains at Man United beyond this summer. “I think one more signing,” Neville told Premier League Daily on what Solskjaer needs to compete for the title next season. “You think about Liverpool signing [Virgil] Van Dijk and Alisson in goal. “One or two more signings or [Paul] Pogba and one more signing are playing to their absolute best. I think United can get closer.” “Maguire has had a really strong impact but another real strong centre-back,” he added. “They have still got to be defensively sound. One more signing and United can challenge.” —

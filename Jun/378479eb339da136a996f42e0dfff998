Manchester City would be willing to form a guard of honour, if Liverpool are confirmed Premier League champions before the two sides meet, the UK Mirror reports. Liverpool only need six more points, to clinch their first title in 30 years. And they can ensure they finish first, by defeating Everton and Crystal Palace in their first two fixtures, when football resumes. However, if City lose to Arsenal next Wednesday, a win for Liverpool at Goodison Park will be enough. Liverpool are then due to visit the Etihad on July 2 and Guardiola is understood to be ready to honour his rivals. Guards of honour are not compulsory and the ceremony has to be agreed between the two clubs beforehand.

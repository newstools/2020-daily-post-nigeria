Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, has landed in Italy to hold talks with Napoli over a possible move. The Serie A side is now in the driving seat for the 21-year-old, who enjoyed a brilliant debut season at Lille. Osimhen has been linked with several big clubs in Italy, Spain and England, but he could now be set to join the Naples outfit. Lille manager, Christophe Galtier, this month admitted the Nigerian who scored 18 goals under him, will leave. Calcio Napoli 1926 reports that the player and his agent flew in on Tuesday for contract talks. It is understood that the Italian club could use Adam Ounas as a makeweight in the transfer.

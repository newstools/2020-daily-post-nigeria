Human Rights Writers Association, HURIWA, has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to deal honestly and openly with what it described as the reality of the deliberate genocide and targeted attacks of Christians and farmers by a combination of armed herdsmen and Boko Haram terrorists. The group accused the government of using diversionary tactics in tackling the issues of massacres while chasing imaginary enemies such as the unarmed Indigenous peoples of Biafra (IPOB). HURIWA said the Buhari-led government has wrongly branded the IPOB as a terrorists group but failed to rein in or declare as terrorists different Fulani groups causing mayhem in the country. HURIWA, in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Monday and signed by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko, lamented that each time Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association makes inflammatory and incendiary statements threatening national security, the Presidency will always go back to its old bag of tricks to excavate her persistent but unintelligent accusations against imaginary enemies such as the IPOB HURIWA recalled that the presidency had on Sunday accused the IPOB of using false claims to deceive the United States and the United Kingdom using the cover of Christianity to call for a US special envoy to be appointed to stop the “genocide” of Christians in Nigeria, insisting that the real purpose of the secessionist group is to cause disagreement between the Nigerian government and its US and UK/European allies. HURIWA, however, dismissed the Presidency’s statement as a soft propaganda against the IPOB and a diversionary tactic by the Buhari government to take the attention of the global community away from the genocide and killings of Christians and farmers by the Boko Haram terrorists and armed Fulani herdsmen going on all over the Country. Among numerous incidences of killing of Christians in the country, HURIWA recall that Boko Haram has kept one of the Dapchi schoolgirls, Leah Sharibu, who had refused to deny her Christianity. HURIWA said it is, therefore, challenging the current the Buhari administration to tell the world how many of the killers have been arrested and prosecuted and punished for these heinous crimes against humanity.

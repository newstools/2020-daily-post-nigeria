World heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury, has said that he suffered racism in 2020. According to the British boxer, he and his wife, Paris Fury, were turned away from a restaurant in the United Kingdom due to his Traveller heritage. Fury said this while reacting to the racial justice protests taking place around the world following the killing of 46-year-old black American, George Floyd by a US policeman. The 31-year-old told GMB on Wednesday: “I think it is a terrible thing that’s happened with the guy [George Floyd] who has been choked – unacceptable behaviour from any colour or race of people. “A lot of riots have been going on in America, and I think they are trying to make a point and let people know it is unacceptable. “Blackout should not just be a one-day thing, and you should not just post it then forget about it for the other 364 days in a year. “Because I am a white male and I suffered racism in 2020 as a white person, coming from a Travelling background. “Even today you can go into pubs, and you can see signs saying, ‘No Travellers or gypsies allowed’.” He added: “Paris and I went to go to a restaurant and they said no gypsies allowed. “I said, ‘I am a heavyweight champion of the world representing this country [United Kingdom]’.”

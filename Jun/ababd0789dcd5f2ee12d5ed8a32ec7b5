The federal government has made it clear it would not hesitate to review the reopening of churches and mosques if its guidelines are not adhered to. The Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, stated this on Thursday during their daily briefing in Abuja. Some of the guidelines shared earlier this week, include worshippers with health issues like diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular diseases staying at home. Also, vulnerable people and those above 55 years should not be part of such religious gatherings. “As we approach the weekend, we remind the public to be aware of the guidelines set for restricted opening of places of worship. “The PTF will continue to monitor the overall compliance to the easing of restriction as well as evolution of the outbreak. “However, we will not hesitate to review as we progress, should the situation warrant, to avoid preventable risks of transmission,” Mustapha said. Nigeria as of Friday morning, has recorded 11,516 confirmed cases of COVID-19.

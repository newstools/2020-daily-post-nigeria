Former Nigeria captain, John Obi Mikel, has hailed Mohammed Salah as one of the best players in the world and tipped the Egyptian to land the Ballon d’Or prize in future. Salah could hardly get into the Chelsea side that had Mikel Obi, scoring just twice in 19 matches before he was sold to Roma in 2016. However, the former Super Eagles midfielder is happy with the progress Salah has made. “I did not expect Mohamed Salah to succeed after he left Chelsea and went to the Italian League, and from there to Liverpool, I did not expect that he would appear as good as he is now,” Mikel Obi said OnTime Sports Egyptian channel. “Salah is no less than the others until he wins the Ballon d’Or, and if that happens I will be proud of him, as he is very committed inside and outside the pitch.”

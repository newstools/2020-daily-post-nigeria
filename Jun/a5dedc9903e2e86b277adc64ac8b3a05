Barcelona has confirmed that captain, Lionel Messi, has sustained a minor right quadriceps injury. The Catalan club also provided the latest team news update on their first-team players ahead of the La Liga resumption next week. Quique Setién’s side disclosed this in a statement on its official website on Friday. “Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has a minor right quadriceps injury and trained in isolation, doing specific exercises to avoid unnecessary risks with just eight days remaining before Barcelona finally get back to playing matches. “Messi should be able to rejoin his team-mates in a few days’ time. “All of the available players were at the Ciutat Esportiva, where they were joined by Jorge Cuenca and Kike Saverio as well as the other B team players who have been working out with the first team over the last few days: Iñaki Peña, R. Araujo, Chumi, Monchu, Riqui Puig, Collado and Ansu Fati. The latter, like Messi, worked out individually this morning. “For tomorrow’s Saturday session the players will train again, but unusually, this session is going to be on the pitch in the Camp Nou as Setién works to get his players ready for the return to football, but with games being played behind closed doors,” the statement read.

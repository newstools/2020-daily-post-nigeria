The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, described as an outright lie, the claims by the Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, that some of its governors are planning to defect to the All Progressives Congress. PDP said Bello’s claim is childish, laughable and pathetic. The opposition party said such peddling of falsehood explains why nobody in Nigeria and beyond takes Governor Bello seriously. In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the opposition party said Bello’s was a desperate attempt to divert public attention from the imminent mass exodus from the APC into its fold. According to the PDP: “Nigerians are aware that among the ranks of APC governors, Bello has no personal relationship with up to three of his colleagues. No APC governor is ready to associate with Governor Bello openly. In other words, not up to three APC governors take him seriously “Moreover, Governor Bello has no relationship of any sort with any governor elected on the platform of the PDP. His current delusion, on national television, about PDP governors, is driven by his usual character of engaging in petty lies. “It is however imperative to state that nobody abandons a cruising liner, which the PDP represents, to jump into a sinking ship like the APC. “It is public knowledge that the APC is disoriented; having sleepless nights and holding endless meetings because they are losing members in droves to the PDP, as most of their key leaders are already on their way out ahead of the collapse of the APC. “Unfortunately, Governor Yahaya Bello knows that he has no space in any other political party. No party will accept him after the collapse of the APC. He will therefore not mind telling brazen lies to create the impressions that the APC is still breathing.”

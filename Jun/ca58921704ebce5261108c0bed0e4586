Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has confirmed that attacking midfielder, Adam Lallana, will leave Anfield at the end of 2019/20 season. Lallana signed a short-term contract extension with Liverpool so that he could complete the campaign. The 32-year-old has struggled with injury since joining the Reds in 2014 from Southampton for £25million. He has netted 22 goals in 178 appearances for Liverpool. “I know how highly sought after Adam is in this moment by other clubs who want him for next season,” Klopp told Liverpool’s official website. “This is absolutely how it should be too because I’m so pleased he will be with us to finish the job this season and have the farewell he deserves so much. “Adam puts the club first always.”

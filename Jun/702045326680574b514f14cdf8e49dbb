The All Progressives Congress (APC) is set to go against Governor Godwin Obaseki’s orders, when they hold their governorship primaries today in the 192 wards of Edo State. On Sunday, the election committee headed by Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, releases guidelines for the primaries. Uzodinma insisted that the exercise will take place in all the wards. However, the Edo state government had said that in compliance with its COVID-19 guidelines, APC must get a waiver before holding any political event in any part of the state. The APC committee have insisted their own guidelines are in compliance with the state’s and a statement by the secretary, Ajibola Basiru, said voting would commence simultaneously at 8am across the 192 wards in the state. Basiru noted that not more than 18 persons would be allowed to gather at the same time, from the start of voting till the process ends. He said, “That the process of the election of the candidate of the party shall commence at 8am on Monday, June 22, 2020 at the various wards in all the local government areas with strict compliance with Edo State’s extant law prohibiting gathering of more than 20 persons. “Not more than 18 persons including Presiding Officers and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) observers shall be at ward voting centre at any point in time “There shall be simultaneous accreditation and voting in batches as aforesaid until all eligible members have cast their votes without violation of the state’s COVID-19 regulations. “Not more than 18 persons shall be in attendance for the announcement of results at all ward centres and collation of results at all levels including the state collation.” Obaseki was disqualified from taking part in the APC primaries, over claims of discrepancy in his certificates. The Governor has since decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party and has been handed a waiver to contest in their primaries.

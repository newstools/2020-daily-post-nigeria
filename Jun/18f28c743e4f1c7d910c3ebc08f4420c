Former Deputy National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Chief Victor Giadom, has expressed gratitude to God over President Muhammadu Buhari support for him. Recall that President Buhari on Thursday declared that “the law is on the side of Victor Giadom”, in his quest to become the Acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Buhari made his position known in a statement signed by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu, on Wednesday evening. The president explained that he has received “very convincing advice” and will hold a virtual meeting with Giadom tomorrow (Thursday). In a swift reaction on his Twitter page, Giadom said the President’s support was for the good of the party. He wrote, “To God be the glory.” “All for the good of our great party the APC! @OfficialAPCNg.”

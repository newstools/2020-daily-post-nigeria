Ex-BBNaija housemate, Khafi has reacted to the death of her younger brother, Alexandra Khareem. DAILY POST reported earlier that Khareem, 20, was shot dead by unknown gunmen in West London. Khafi took to her YouTube page minutes ago urging her fans to pray for her family. She broke down in tears in her short video without giving more details surrounding the incident. Khafi said: “I will prefer just to stay in silence. If you guys can just pray for my family, that’ll be amazing.” <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HYqFFuMs6yo/hqdefault.jpg" alt="#KhafiPrays - Second Day on YouTube!">

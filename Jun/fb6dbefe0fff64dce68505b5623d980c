Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has given reasons for his side’s 2-1 loss to Brighton on Saturday. The Gunners who lost 3-0 at Manchester City on Wednesday, took the lead through Nicolas Pepe in the second half. However, Lewis Dunk forced the ball in for 1-1, before Neal Maupay grabbed the winner late on. Arteta, speaking to BT Sports after the game, lamented his side’s profligacy in front of goal. He said: “It’s unacceptable the way we lost today. “We missed so many chances, we gave them the first goal, and we didn’t compete in the second goal.”

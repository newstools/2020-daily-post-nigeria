The Federal Government has said churches and mosques that do not comply with “required measures”, will not be allowed to reopen. The National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu, stated this during the daily briefing on Tuesday. Aliyu also suggested that it was safer for congregants to worship at home, despite the lifting of ban on religious gatherings. He however warned that “Places of worship that do not comply with required measures should not be allowed to operate. “State authorities should not allow such churches or mosques to operate.” Aliyu explained that strict compliance to provided guidelines was important, as that nature of religious gatherings could see Coronavirus spread easily.

Ex-BBNaija housemates, Tacha and Thelma on Friday engaged in a war of words on social media. It all started after Thelma during BBNaija Reunion show blamed Tacha’s fans for her early eviction from the reality show. She mentioned that her fight with Tacha over fish made her fans known as ‘Titans’ evict her from the ‘Pepper Dem’ edition. According to her, “Tacha fans are like her.” Tacha who was not present at last night’s BBNaija Reunion show took to her Twitter page mocking Thelma writing: “Fish, Fish na wa. Thelma come let me buy you Fish! Call me.” Her fans also joined in dragging Thelma accusing her of using them to trend. This did not go down well with Thelma as she responded to Tacha and her fans on her Instagram page. Thelma wrote: “There is no need to attack me if your role model is worth emulation” “I don’t need your fish sister, I have an entire fish pond.” Tacha, again, responded by applauding her fans for always having her back and lifting others. “We rise by lifting others! Titans if they don’t appreciate you trust me I DO! “Titans resurrecting careers since 1951. You feel me?” She tweeted.

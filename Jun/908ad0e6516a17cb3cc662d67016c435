Former Arsenal striker, Robin van Persie, has criticised the club following their 2-1 victory against Sheffield United in the FA Cup quarter-final encounter on Sunday. Arsenal defeated Sheffield United at Bramall Lane to book their place in the FA Cup semi-final after two goals from Nicolas Pepe and Dani Ceballos. But Van Persie believes Mikel Arteta’s men did not create a lot of chances against Sheffield, adding that the Gunners’ performances against the host were not outstanding. “I was expecting more [from Arsenal] to be honest,” Van Persie told BT Sport. “They did not create a lot of chances – only two in the first half and not enough. “A great goal from Ceballos got them the win, but it was not outstanding, no.” Van Persie added: “You can see that this team is not fully connected yet. “If you look at the connection from the defence, to midfield, to strikers, it is not moving as one. “But I do believe that if you give them time, and he [Mikel Arteta] should get all the time he needs, I do believe that he can get it right.” Arsenal’s next fixture is against Norwich City on Wednesday night in the Premier League.

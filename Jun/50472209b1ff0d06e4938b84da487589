Manchester City has confirmed that striker, Sergio Aguero and defender, Eric Garcia will both miss the Citizens’ away Premier League against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge tonight due to injuries. Man City also disclosed that defender, John Stones, could be in contention to feature for the club against the Blues. The Premier League champions stated this in a post via its official website on Thursday morning. Pep Guardiola’s side head to the game after thrashing Burnley 5-0 on Monday in their last Premier League encounter at the Etihad Stadium. “Sergio Aguero (knee) and Eric Garcia (head injury) will miss the game, while John Stones (ankle) is doubtful but maybe contention to return “Gabriel Jesus is set to replace Aguero, but Pep Guardiola also feels he has plenty of options within his squad to cope with the Argentine’s absence, including using Ilkay Gundogan as a withdrawn forward,” a club statement on Man City’s official website read. Meanwhile, speaking ahead of the clash, Man City manager, Pep Guardiola, insisted that Frank Lampard’s side has always been a real force in the English top-flight league. “Chelsea has always been a real force. With Antonio Conte, they won the league, and that was four years ago. “In recent years they haven’t spent too much, but if they do, it’s because they can afford it. “If the clubs can do it they will do it. If they have done it, they feel they need it. But the power was already there. “When Abramovich took over it was uncomfortable for the Premier League, and then Manchester City came, and that was uncomfortable for the Premier League,” Guardiola said at his pre-match press conference. The match is scheduled for 8:15 pm Nigerian time.

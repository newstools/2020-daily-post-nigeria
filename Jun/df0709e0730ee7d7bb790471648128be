The Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Political Matters, Osaigbovo Iyoha, has claimed that his principal will make a decision on decamping to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) “in a day or two”. Iyoha stated this when he appeared on Channels Television’s programme Sunday Politics yesterday. His comments came hours after Obaseki met with two PDP Governors – Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom State. “In a day or two, we will know whether Obaseki will join the PDP or not. We are still consulting,” Iyoha said. He also claimed that APC disqualified Obaseki, because they wanted to rig the June 22 primaries. “Obaseki was removed because they wanted to rig the primaries. They have results that were already prepared for this direct primary and somehow the results got leaked. “So they just looked for the easiest way out. What could they have done? It is to go judge his certificate and say that the man was not qualified,” Iyoha added.

Premier League giants, Chelsea are “willing to agree” a persuasive deal for Manchester United midfielder, Angel Gomes, according to UK Independent. Chelsea is planning to strike a deal that will see Gomes switch to Stamford Bridge this summer’s transfer window. Gomes has already rejected an offer of £25,000 with bonuses from Man United to stay at Old Trafford. The 19-year-old, whose contract expires on June 30, believes he can get much better offers elsewhere. His agent, Pini Zahavi, is now in discussions with a host of clubs to sound out the best deal for the youngster. Meanwhile, Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, on Monday morning confirmed during his pre-match press conference that Gomes looks set to leave the club after failing to agree on a new contract. “I have not heard from him [Gomes] last night or this morning, so it seems like they have not managed to agree on anything. “The answer is probably short – yes [he could leave at the end of his contract].” Gomes only featured twice from the bench for the Red Devils in the Premier League so far this campaign. The England Under-20 international also started three times for Solskjaer’s side in the Europa League.

Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, on Monday alleged that Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State was disqualified from the APC’s governorship primary, scheduled for June 22 by someone who does not have a certificate. DAILY POST recalls that Obaseki was disqualified from the party’s governorship primary for an alleged defective certificate. The panel also disqualified two other aspirants, Matthew Aigbuhuenze Iduoriyekemwen and Chris Ogiemwonyi. Recall that Oshiomhole and Obaseki have been at loggerheads, following the decision of the governor to run for a second term. Reacting to the development, Wike in a tweet via his official Twitter page, described Obaseki’s disqualification as an “irony”. He said: “Obaseki was disqualified by someone who doesn’t have a certificate, what an irony!” Obaseki has since reacted to his disqualification. He vowed not to appeal the action of the APC. Meanwhile, the University of Ibadan, UI, had since cleared Obaseki of certificate forgery. The Registrar of the university, Olubunmi Faluyi, stated that Obaseki graduated from the institution with Second Class Honours, Lower Division. Faluyi confirmed that Obaseki studied Classics between 1976 to 1979.

Following the sudden rise in the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases in Ondo State, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Tuesday reiterated the need for residents of the State to take the issue with all seriousness and caution. Akeredolu, who made the appeal on his verified Twitter handle while expressing concern over the development, stated that the situation was a matter of life or death, which the people must choose between. DAILY POST had on Monday reported that three fresh COVID-19 related deaths were recorded in the State, with 19 confirmed cases discovered within 12 days. According to the governor, with the community transmission of the virus already in full force in the State, surviving and defeating the pandemic should be the topmost priority. “As a people, we must make a choice now, between life and death, between health and wealth and between stability and unhappiness. We must find a balance between our pleasure and daily freedom on the one hand and the survival and self-preservation of our society on the other hand. “Members of the public who had patronized the fairly used fabric and shoes stalls at Oja Oba market in Akure, where our 43rd case was picked up, are advised in their own interest and for the good of our society, to present themselves to our health facilities for immediate testing.”

The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Edo State, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has appealed to Governor Godwin Obaseki, to return to the party. Ize-Iyamu made this appeal after winning APC’s ticket on Monday in Benin City, the state capital. According to him, Obaseki should “set aside his anger” and return to the ruling party. “I will like to appeal to him to return to the party. In every family, you have disagreements; let it not be said that it was this disagreement that pushed him out,” Ize-Iyamu said. Ize-Iyamu, who was PDP’s candidate in the 2016 governorship election, added that he made “that mistake before and I have come to realize it was a grievous error and I would not want him as an elder brother to make the same mistake.” Obaseki decamped to PDP, after he was disqualified from contesting in the APC primary.

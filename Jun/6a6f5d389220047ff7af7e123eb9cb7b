La Liga champions, Barcelona will reportedly sack Quique Setien as head coach at the end of the season, if the club fails to win the 2019/20 Spanish top-flight league title or the UEFA Champions League trophy this season, Goal reports. Barcelona’s results and performances have not improved since Setien replaced Ernesto Valverde as Barca manager in January and the Blaugrana’s hierarchy are ready to take action on the 61-year-old’s future at Camp Nou. Setien has lost the confidence of the Barcelona dressing room, while the club’s chiefs are also unhappy with recent performances. The former Real Betis manager, who signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Barcelona, was involved in a dressing room bust-up with his players following their 2-2 draw with Celta Vigo in La Liga on Saturday. Barcelona twice surrendered leads against the relegation-threatened side, which allowed Real Madrid to open a two-point gap at the top of LaLiga table. Luis Suarez, who scored a brace in the draw, told reporters after the match that the club’s coaches were to blame for Barca’s poor away form. Barcelona have picked up just two wins from their last six games on the road. Setien’s men will host Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night in their next La Liga fixture.

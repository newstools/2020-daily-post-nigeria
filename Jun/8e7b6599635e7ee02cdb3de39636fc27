The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has expressed worry and displeasure over the poor level of compliance with safety measures of keeping physical distancing, wearing of masks in public places, sanitation and personal hygiene nationwide. The chairman of the PTF and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, disclosed this during the PTFâ€™s COVID-19 daily briefing on Monday in Abuja. Mustapha listed the places where the non-compliance level was much to include markets, motor parks and some worship centres. He also advised against the planned moves by some states to reopen schools, television viewing centres, stadium and other places where large gatherings could take place. According to him, it was not yet safe to do so adding that much caution should be exercised across the country. He also gave strong reassurances that the Federal Government would continue to implement measures meant to safeguard the economy.

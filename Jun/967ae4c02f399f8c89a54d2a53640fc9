The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has thanked President Muhammadu Buhari, describing him as indeed a president of every state of the federation. Wike stated this in a letter he addressed to the president, thanking him for releasing the sum N78.9 billion the Rivers Government used in maintenance of Federal roads in the State. The Federal government had earlier in the month approved the refund of over N78billion to the Rivers State government for the money spent on the construction of federal roads in the State. The approval for the refund was made at the third virtual Federal Executive Council meeting at the State House, presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari. This followed a memo presented by the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola. The Governor, in the letter, also promised that his administration is willing and ready to partner with Buhari-led government “to advance the developmental inspirations of Rivers State in particular, and Nigeria in general.” The outspoken Rivers Governor further pleaded with the President to “kindly oblige us a State visit… to see what we have accompany for our people with the money.” Recall that Wike had recently berated the Federal Government for deliberately neglecting Rivers State in the release of N148billion for roads construction across the country. The Governor declared that the action of the Federal Government is the most shameful act of marginalisation in a Federation where Rivers State contributes to the financial sustenance of the country. He said Rivers politicians in APC should be able to plead with the Federal Government to site projects in Rivers State to expand their political relevance.

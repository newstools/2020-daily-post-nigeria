The Presidency has assured Nigerians, again, that the nation’s armed forces are fully capable of dealing with the challenges of banditry and terrorism. It urged more patience from the people as the military takes appropriate steps to block gaps being exploited to unleash mayhem on innocent citizens. The Presidency, in a statement signed by Garba Shehu, said that President Muhammadu Buhari, has approved a joint military and police operation specifically targeted at combing Niger, Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara and Sokoto States to rid the areas of bandits. It assured that surveillance will be improved, with more night vision aircrafts already deployed under “Operation Accord’’. The operation was launched three weeks ago, Shehu said. “Nigeria’s military has displayed its capabilities in the past and will show it again by dealing with the current challenges,” the statement quoted the President as saying. President Buhari, according to Shehu, called on the people of his home State Katsina, to be patient and supportive of the ongoing military operations. He also sympathized with those who have lost their loved ones, sustained injuries and lost properties in the crisis. The presidency warned that taking to the streets for protest could distract the military operations. “The major forests in North Western Nigeria have been identified as home to the bandits in the region. The operation will clear all these forests,’’ Shehu further quoted Buhari as saying in the statement.

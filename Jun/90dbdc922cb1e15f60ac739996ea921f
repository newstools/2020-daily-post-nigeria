The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has said his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole, had no money when he contested to become governor in 2007. Oshiomhole, who was a former President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), contested under the Action Congress (AC) and lost the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Oserheimen Osunbor. However, he challenged the outcome of the election in court and was declared winner a year later. Obaseki, speaking with journalists after submitting his nomination and expression of interest forms for the 2020 governorship election in Abuja, also insisted he did not betray Oshiomhole, who is now the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “In life, everybody gets helped, everybody gets assisted. The person you talked about (Oshiomhole), he had no money when he left Labour to contest. “We knew what we did to make him Governor. I sacrificed eight years of my life pro bono, I collected to no Kobo to serve him in Edo. So, when you talk of betrayal, the biggest betrayal can be when people betray a cause, when they betray an idea. “I want to put it on record that I am grateful, he assisted me just as I assisted him. I know the sacrifices we made to make him national chairman,” Obaseki said.

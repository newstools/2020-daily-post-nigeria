The newly appointed Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Caretaker Committee/Extra Ordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, has vowed to carry every member of the party along. Buni made this promise on Thursday, during a brief stopover at the APC’s National Secretariat in Abuja. The Yobe State governor was the party’s National Secretary before his new appointment today. “I am a team player and I am here to manage a crisis and if you do not manage a crisis, the crisis will manage you. So, without justice, there will be no peace, so I am ready to do justice to every APC member. “NEC is the highest organ of the party except for the convention, and NEC can function for convention in-between, so any decision taken by NEC is the final decision. NEC has directed that every member in court should withdraw his suit. “(The) party will carry all members along especially the leaders of the APC. Many of them have paid their dues. So, we will carry them along,” he said. During Thursday’s NEC meeting, the APC’s National Working Committee (NWC) was dissolved. The decision was taken by the President Muhammadu Buhari with Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, embattled Deputy National Secretary of APC, Victor Giadom and some members of the APC National Working Committee, in attendance.

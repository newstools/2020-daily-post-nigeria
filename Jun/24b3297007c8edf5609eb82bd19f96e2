Manchester United are in pole position to sign Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, this summer’s transfer window. This is as reported by a British newspaper, Daily Express on Monday. Man United view Ndidi as a viable alternative to Ajax’s Donny van de Beek, one of their priority targets for this summer. The Red Devils are seriously looking at Ndidi as manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, plots to add strength to his midfield this summer ahead of next season. Ndidi has drawn the interest of Man United in the past. The Nigerian international, who has also drawn the interest of PSG in the past, is expected to cost around £50million. The 23-year-old’s current contract at the Foxes will expire in 2024. Speaking on his future recently, Ndidi insisted that he is delighted at Leicester City. “I still have a contract at Leicester,” Ndidi said. “I’m learning and trying to improve myself every day, and I am doing okay here, so no need to go anywhere. “We are doing well, and I am enjoying myself here.”

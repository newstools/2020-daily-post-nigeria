The English Premier League (EPL) have announced that each team will be allowed up to five substitutions in a match for the remaining of the 2019/2020 season. The English top-flight league also confirmed that team benches would increase to nine players the remaining of the campaign. EPL said this in a statement on its official website on Thursday afternoon. “Premier League shareholders today agreed on temporary changes to the rules relating to substitute players,” the statement read. “For the remainder of the 2019/20 season, the number of substitutes that can be used during a match will increase from three to five players. “This is in line with the temporary law amendment made by the International Football Association Board last month. “Shareholders also approved for Clubs to increase the maximum number of substitute players on the bench from seven to nine for the rest of the 2019/20 season.” EPL will resume on June 17 after almost three months of suspension due to the coronavirus pandemic world-wide.

Former Gombe Governor, Ibrahim Dankwambo, who recently endorsed Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo state has warned against Godfatherism in Nigerian politics. The former Accountant General of the Federation made this statement on his Twitter page a few minutes after Obaseki dumped the All Progressives Congress, APC. Obaseki announced his resignation from APC after his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday. Dankwambo warned that political godfatherism will rob Nigerians of those meant to serve and hinder national development. His tweet read: “Political godfatherism stunts economic growth. It encourages a system that robs Peter (the Masses) to pay Paul (the godfathers). “Our governance system must allow power to return back to the people, so we can chart a new course for local and national development.”

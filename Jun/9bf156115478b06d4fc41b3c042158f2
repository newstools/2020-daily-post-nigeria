Comrade Ogbaloi Kelly Stephen, Chairman of Edo State Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has called on the Edo electorate and the youth in particular not to allow themselves to be used by political power seekers in the State. The former Labour Party State Boss, described the present political drama in Edo State as a mockery of democracy, adding that other registered political parties in Nigeria should learn from what is happening in APC. According to him, APC as the ruling party has failed Nigeria abysmally in all areas of human development. ‘APC is currently the government in power both at the Federal and State level, ordinarily, I won’t want to talk about it. In 2015, Nigerians came out in their millions to support APC so also in 2016 in Edo State’ One expected that they should provide quality governance for the generality of Nigerians, but rather they have decided to turn the party into a quarrelsome party. We expected that the likes of the National Chairman Adams Oshiomhole ought to understand how to run the party profitably and take it out of confusion and crisis.” ‘Yes as the head of IPAC in Edo State, I want to advice other political parties and the electorates in the Edo to get themselves organized this time around, it shouldn’t be a situation where you remain complacent and go to vote and say that whatever happens later does not matter to you’ There is a need for the electorates to vote a government that will be there for you in terms of maintaining the rights and privileges of the Edo people. Beyond that, they should not allow desperate political power-seekers to use them for their own selfish end, they should be able to distinguish between money and good governance. ‘I must tell you that APC has failed us abysmally, and our politicians are making a mockery of democracy’

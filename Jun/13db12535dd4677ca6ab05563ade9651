Manchester United midfielder, Scott McTominay, has signed a new five-year contract with the club. McTominay, who graduated from the Red Devils Academy, has played a key role for the club this season, scoring four goals. He is a contender for the club’s Player of the Season award and his good form has been rewarded with a new deal. The new deal will see him stay at Old Trafford until June 2025, with an option to extend for a further year. “All I have ever known is United and I hope that my passion for the club shows every time I go onto the pitch. I’ll continue to give everything for this club whenever I put on the shirt. “I want to thank the manager for the faith he has shown in me and everyone at the club that has helped me get to where I am today,” McTominay told United’s official website.

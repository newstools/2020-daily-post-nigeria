The Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), has revealed that its late acting Director, Finance and Administration, Ibanga Etang, died from complications linked to COVID-19. This was contained in a statement signed by its Director, Corporate Affairs, Charles Odili. Odili said NDDC decided to make it public, after getting clearance from Etang’s family. “The family has authorised the Commission to announce the late Executive Director tested positive to COVID-19,” he said. Odili also added that “During the meeting with the family, they expressed fervent desire, that the death of the Executive Director should not be politicised, wishing to be left alone to mourn with dignity. This also is the position of the Commission. NDDC shut down its corporate headquarters, following a COVID-19 scare following the death of Etang. Etang died at the Rivers State University Teaching Hospital (RSUTH) on May 28.

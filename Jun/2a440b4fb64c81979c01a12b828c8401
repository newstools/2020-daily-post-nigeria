Mohammed said three deaths were initially reported but with the additional four recently, the state now has a total of seven COVID-19 related deaths He further explained that out of the seven deaths recorded, three were from community transmission because they did not have any travel history. According to him, there were only 23 active cases in the state that were on admission at Specialist, Federal Teaching Hospital and Kwadon Isolation centres Gombe. He also expressed concern over the way people were conducting their businesses in the state without the fear of the pandemic adding that the negative attitude of members of the public to the outbreak was worrisome because they were frustrating the efforts of the taskforce team. “Community transmission can only be checked if they cooperate with health workers who are out for contact tracing,” he added.

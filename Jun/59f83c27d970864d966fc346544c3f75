Premier League giants, Manchester United have reportedly registered an interest in signing Arsenal midfielder, Matteo Guendouzi. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Guendouzi’s future at Arsenal remains uncertain after the French player told the Gunners’ board during a disciplinary meeting that he would be willing to leave Emirates this summer. According to L’Equipe, Man United have joined Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain in the race to sign Guendouzi. The French newspaper added that Guendouzi is also unsure about staying at the North London club as he wants to boost his chances of becoming a regular starter for the France national team. Guendouzi has struggled with regular game time under Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, so far this campaign. The 21-year-old is valued at €40 million (£36m) by Arsenal.

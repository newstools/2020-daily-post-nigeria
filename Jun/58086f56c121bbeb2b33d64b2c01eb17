Anthony Joshua and Tyson Fury have agreed a 50-50 split for their first fight in 2021, the Daily Mail reports. There will, however, be a 10 percent jump going into the rematch. That means the sharing formula will change to 60-40 for the second fight. Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn and Fury’s co-promoter Frank Warren have confirmed that progress has been made in talks over the double-header, especially the money part. However, there is still a lot of work to be done in making the fight. First, Fury and Joshua must first come through bouts with Deontay Wilder and Kubrat Pulev respectively. There is also the political tangle of Dillian Whyte’s status as mandatory challenger for Fury’s WBC title and unresolved discussions about the venue and date.

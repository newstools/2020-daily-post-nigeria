Ohanaeze Youth Council (OYC) has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to honour former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. The youths say Atiku deserves to be recognised on June 12, 2020, “as one the heroes of democracy”. The call was made in a statement on Thursday by OYC President, Okechukwu Isiguzoro, and Secretary, Okwu Nnabuike. The group recalled that since 2013, Atiku has played “significant roles”, noting that the former VP, M.K.O. Abiola and others did their best to ensure civilian rule. Speaking of the 2023 elections, the OYC called for the respect of the rotational presidency between North and South. “This will allow a Nigerian from the South to emerge as President Buhari’s successor. Anyone encouraging Atiku Abubakar to contest in 2023 against the political tide is deceiving him.” The group noted that political jobbers were assuring Atiku of Igbo support in 2023. OYC said the advice was a “fake promissory note” to defraud the Wazirin Adamawa. “Those who deceived him through the restructuring of Nigeria in 2019 have been systematically displaced in Igboland. Atiku Abubakar should know that Igbo Governors are doubtful of his sincerity.” The statement added that the “North and West will opt for a fresh choice but definitely not him”.

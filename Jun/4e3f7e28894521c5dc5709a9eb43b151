Dear friend, Officer Ken here… I’ve got to get this off my chest before I explode. Quickly, I’m in haste as I type this newsletter. And I won’t bother proofreading it because I can’t just wait to send it for publishing, so you’d read this information of vital importance as soon as possible. However though, I’d apologize for any grammatical blunder you may encounter as you read through. No more messing around. Let’s dive right in. I’ve just received the biggest testimony ever. You won’t believe it. A lady (who learnt about my breakthrough story of how I cured my Glaucoma and cataract against doctor’s prediction…) called me early last month. She was panting. Her elder brother just went blind of glaucoma. He was declared legally blind by his doctor. She started sobbing as she explained to me what has become of her brother. All hope was lost. But she didn’t take her doctors word for it nor give up. So, she started scouring the internet for possible remedy. Then she stumbles upon my open secret video, which was published by Vanguard, Punch, LegitNG, and, other national dailies. …Watch the video here: Helthsolve.org/vision She carefully watched the breakthrough video before calling my office. She told me that she’d totally believed all what the editors have written about me. But can I ask you a question? She said… Go ahead please, I responded. She paused for a while. No words at her ends. Are you there? I asked just to be sure we were still connected. Finally, she broke into a loud cry. She cried more painfully than when the call began. … then she struggled to speak out, but inaudible and repetitive. …in your case, she said, you weren’t totally blind even though it was severe. At least, you made your discovery earlier – but here’s my brother. . .already confirmed blind about 2 days ago. I mean, he’s legally blind! How come I wasn’t fortunate enough to come across your breakthrough publication before this time. At this point, a lot were going through in my head. For instance, l imagined she and her brother relying solely on the doctor’s prescription and not wanting to try any other remedy until everything went astray. …however, I became speechless for a second, maybe more. I was trying to ruminate the right words to console her with, because obviously, she didn’t only need it. She deserved it. As I tried to soothe her with some words of comfort, she raised a big question… “Officer Ken, she said, can my brother ever restore his lost sight? Would your “Remedy” make him see again? That question sends numbness down my spine. I wished I could say YES and I also wished I could say NO. But I said neither. Instead, I told her the bitter truth I always tell every of the patients that calls in to ask similar question. …That my “Remedy” has an exception. To my surprise, she told me she wants it. I kid you not. Mrs Amaka Umeh (that’s her name) is one of just few people with HUGE faith. The following morning, I shipped out a complete set of “Sight O Caps “” to her doorstep in Awka . . .to administer to her brother by following the dosage i prescribed to her. Guess what happened next? I can’t just say it… …I can’t express this BIGGEST testimony. Check attached WhatsApp screenshot below and see it to yourself.        Those screenshots of our chat have said it all. But here’s the thing, Inasmuch-as this breakthrough pill has been able to make Mrs Umeh’s brother to see, but I still don’t guarantee that this pill would work for you if you’re already been confirmed “legally” blind by your doctor. But if you still have some glimpse of sight left no matter how little, and provided your sight problems is naturally occurred such as glaucoma, cataracts, short-sightedness, long-sightedness, astigmatism, macular degeneration, retina detachments and other numerous eyes problems – then this tiny pill would perfectly restore them in 90days or less.

Sincerely, the reason I told her that was, firstly, we hadn’t initially tried this pill on patients who are totally blind. Plus, secondly, we absolutely do give a 100% Money back guarantee. Meaning if you take take this breakthrough pill religiously as I instruct, and if you don’t see the desired result within 90 days as promised – then we refund every single penny of your purchase. Our reputation precedes us. And we can’t risk it for anything. You see, i was EXTREMELY careful when i made that bold statement. I must be certain that you’re not totally blind before I ship the sets of this pills to you. But because Mrs Umeh insisted, I’d send it to her regardless. So, I reminded her (that since her beloved brother is already confirmed blind, the financial risk would entirely be on her if she decides to buy and gift him for trial purpose) that we don’t guarantee refund in such case. Yes, I’ve had to stress that to her because I could only imagine how much she has expended already for prescription drugs and surgeries. But she stood her ground and go on the contrary. And her decision (filled with faith) was worthwhile. this is the BIGGEST testimony I’d got this week, and I couldn’t hold myself to keep it but to share with it you. I’ll update you as to the progress of his recovery, and I’ll even have them (Mrs Umeh & her brother) make a testimonial video to this regard. MY VERY BIG PROMISE TO YOU TODAY IS THAT, PROVIDED YOU STILL HAVE SOME GLIMPSE OF SIGHT LEFT NO MATTER HOW LITTLE, THEN THIS PILL IS FOR YOU… CLICK THE LINK BELOW, WATCH THE OPEN-SECRET VIDEO… CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO: healthsolve.org/vision SEE YOU INSIDE!

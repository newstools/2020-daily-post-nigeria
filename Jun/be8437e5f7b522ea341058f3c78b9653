The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has warned the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, not to interfere with the governorship primary in Edo State. Obaseki stated this after submitting his Expression of Interest and Nomination form at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja on Wednesday. “I’m calling on Oshiomhole to recuse himself from the Edo governorship process because he is an interested party,” he said. “It is against natural justice for a man to be a judge in his own case.” Obaseki also maintained he was ready for either direct or indirect primary, but insisted the Constitution of the party must be followed. The Edo APC primaries will take place on June 22.

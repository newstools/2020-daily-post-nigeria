Ike Ekeremadu, erstwhile Deputy Senate President, has commended Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State for defecting to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Ekweremadu described Obaseki’s defection to PDP as a “new dawn” for the people of Edo State. Obaseki had on Friday officially joined the PDP, after he dumped the All Progressives Congress, APC, following disputes with the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. Addressing supporters and members of the party, the governor had said PDP’s energy will help him move the state to the next level. Reacting to Obaseki’s defection, the former Deputy Senate President said PDP was a good platform for development and good governance. In a series of tweets, Ekweremadu wrote: “I join other PDP leaders and faithful in welcoming the Governor of Edo State, His Excellency, Godwin Obaseki, to our great party. “No doubt, the PDP offers the Governor and the good people of Edo State not only a veritable platform for victory in the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state but also a sure path to peace, good governance and speedy development; and together, we will do it ”.

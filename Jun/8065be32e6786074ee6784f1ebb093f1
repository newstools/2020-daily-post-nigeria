Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov has identified midfielder, Fred, as the club’s player of the 2019/20 season. Fred has become a regular starter under Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, so far this season, following a rocky start to life at Old Trafford. But Berbatov believes the Brazilian international has been Man United’s standout performer this campaign. “At first, Fred had a difficult time at Manchester United, getting used to the tempo, with the speed of the games and the challenges,” Berbatov told Betfair ahead of Man United’s away Premier League clash with Tottenham Hotspur on Friday night. “It is not easy, coming from a different league, and sometimes he spent too much time on the ball and lost possession easily. “Slowly but surely, however, his game has changed, and he has become used to the Premier League. “His improvement reminds me of how Moussa Sissoko, people did not rate him but now Fred is player of the season already, and the fans love him.”

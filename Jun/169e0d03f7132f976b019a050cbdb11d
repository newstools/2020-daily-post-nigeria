The Jigawa State Government has opened interstate travel and ordered for the immediate disband of all the security checkpoints in its border. Governor Badaru Abubakar disclosed this on Saturday while briefing newsmen in Government House, Dutse. He said the state presently has only one patient with active case in isolation centre. He said this followed the discharge of seven COVID-19 patients from isolation centre after they have fully recovered. DAILY POST reported that the Jigawa State Government had closed all its COVID-19 isolation centres in the state. The Governor, however, noted that the state COVID-19 response strategy is continuously yielding results. “As we ease lockdown, lift ban on weekly market days and allow interstate travel, it is also necessary to disband the security posts at our borders with immediate effect. ” Their expertise would be deployed if need arises as we continue this arduous journey against the COVID-19 pandemic in the state ” Badaru, therefore, expressed dismay on the manner at which people violate public safety measures. He said the state will not hesitate to deal swiftly and decisively with erring individuals.

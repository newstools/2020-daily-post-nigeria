A five-year-old boy identified as Mujeeb has been macheted to death by yet-to-be-identified persons on Monday in Akinyele Local Government Area of Oyo State. DAILY POST gathered that Mujeeb had gone to the back of the house in Tose area of Akinyele to defecate when he was hit by the assailants who may have escaped into the bush afterwards. Mujeed mother, who narrated how the incident occurred, said, “When the rain subsided, he told his older sibling that he wanted to go and defecate. The older sibling opened the back door for him to go defecate. “Had I known I would have asked him to defecate in the front of the house. Suddenly, he cried out, “Mummy, Mummy”. His older sibling and I rushed out to the backyard but we didn’t see him initially. “Then I checked beside the bush and found him macheted. He hadn’t died when we got there. So, people took him from my hand to take him to the hospital but he later died.” DAILY POST gathered that the killing of Mujeeb, is coming few weeks after no fewer than three ladies were killed by yet to be identified persons in the local government area. However, all efforts made by DAILY POST to get the reaction of the Public Relations Officer of the state Police Command, Mr. Olugbenga Fadeyi proved to abortive as calls put to his mobile phone were not successful while an SMS sent to him has not been replied as at the time of filing this report on Monday.

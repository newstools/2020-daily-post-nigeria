Liverpool are Premier League champions for the 2019/2020 season. The Reds were confirmed title winners without kicking a ball, following Manchester City’s 2-1 defeat at Chelsea on Thursday night. Frank Lampard’s men took the lead through Christian Pulisic’s fine solo effort in the first half. City levelled through Kevin De Bruyne’s exquisite free-kick. However, Fernandinho handled the ball in the area, giving away a penalty that Willian put away. Chelsea’s win ends Liverpool’s 30-year wait for a title. Jurgen Klopp’s side, who thrashed Crystal Palace 4-0 on Wednesday, have sealed their first Premier League crown with seven games still to play.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State has split over the June 22 governorship primary. On Friday, the factional Chairman of the party, Anselm Ojezua, said the exercise will not hold on the date. Ojezua also rejected the Governor Hope Uzodinma-led primary committee. On Saturday, APC Publicity Secretary in Edo, Chris Azebame, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the exercise was not postponed. He said it was not Ojezua’s duty to make such a decision as “the responsibility of conducting party primaries rest with the national body”. The spokesman reiterated that the already fixed date was sacrosanct and that direct primaries would be conducted across the 192 wards in the state. Azebame said contrary to speculations in some quarters, the party had a valid and updated members register in Edo. Azebame did not disclose the membership strength of the party expected to participate in the June 22 primary.

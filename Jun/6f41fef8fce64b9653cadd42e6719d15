The Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, on Wednesday reacted to allegations of bribing members of the state House of Assembly with N10m each to impeach his deputy, Agboola Ajayi. Akeredolu described the allegation as a tactic to distract his administration. Ajayi’s Deputy Chief Press Secretary, Tope Okeowo, had on Tuesday alleged that 26 lawmakers of the state House of Assembly collected N10 million each to “illegally” impeach the deputy governor. Okeowo had alleged that the impeachment move was because of Ajayi’s decision to decamp from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday. However, Akeredolu explained that he can not waste his personal and state resources on what he termed a “sunken ship.” In a tweet on his verified Twitter handle, Akeredolu wrote: “N10 Million for each house member? How! Is it possible? Yet another tactic to distract this administration. “Smiling face with open mouth and cold sweat I will not waste state or personal resources on a sunken ship. Let God decide his fate.”

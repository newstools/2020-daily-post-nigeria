Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has reacted to his side’s shocking 3-2 loss to Brentford in a friendly on Wednesday evening. Speaking with Sky Sports, Arteta claimed the players were still finding their rhythm and fitness. The Gunners thrashed Charlton Athletic 6-0 in the first friendly last Saturday, but fell to the Championship side in their second warm-up game. Joe Willock opened scoring, but Brentford equalized after the break through Tarique Fosu. Alexandre Lacazette put Arsenal back in front, but goals from Halil Dervisoglu and Shandon Baptiste sealed the win. “We’re trying different things. We’re trying to give minutes in their legs to all of the players, obviously you have to change a lot of players through the games. “Getting adapted to playing in an empty stadium as well, not having that energy from the fans. “It was good, we played two friendlies, we’re getting a bit of rhythm, we haven’t played for a while, we tried to make is as close as possible to a real game,” Arteta said.

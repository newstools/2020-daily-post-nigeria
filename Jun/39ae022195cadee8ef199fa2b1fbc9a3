Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has warned his players that they have not won anything, following a 2-1 win at Real Sociedad on Sunday. Los Blancos took the lead through a Sergio Ramos penalty, before Karim Benzema made it 2-0. Mikel Merino pulled one back for Sociedad late in the game, but Real held on for an important victory. Zidane’s men are now level on 65 points with Barcelona, but sit in first place thanks to their head-to-head record. “We haven’t won anything yet. It’s three wins and nine points, but we know it will be difficult until the end. “We have to keep going, we’re in good form, the players are doing well physically and technically,” Zidane told the media after the game. There are eight fixtures left in the Spanish top flight.

A man allegedly parading himself as a lawyer has been arrested by the police in Ogun State on Tuesday. The suspected fake lawyer, Elijah Ayodeji Ojo, was said to have confessed to the police that he only attended the university, but he did not graduate. According to a release by the Ogun Ogun Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, Ojo confessed that “though he gained admission to study law at Ekiti State University, he did not finish the course, neither did he go to law school.” The police spokesman said the suspect was on Sunday, saying “has been parading himself as a legal practitioner for quite some time now and has been using that to swindle several people of huge amounts of money.” DAILY POST learnt that the self-acclaimed lawyer was arrested following a petition written to the DPO Ajuwon police station by a legal practitioner. “The complainant had reported that Ojo used to parade himself as a lawyer, thereby extorting money from unsuspecting members of the public, despite the fact that he had never been to law school anywhere. “Upon the petition, the DPO Ajuwon division, SP Andrew Akinseye, and his team of detectives embarked on a painstaking intelligence investigation about the self-acclaimed lawyer. “In the process of their investigation, they came across a woman who was charged to court for an offence, but was duped by the suspect, who collected about N300,000 from her to perfect her bail condition, but never showed up in the court. “The suspect was subsequently arrested after much evidence had been gathered against him. “On interrogation, he confessed that though he gained admission to study law at Ekiti State University but did not finish the course or went to law school,” Oyeyemi confirmed. Meanwhile, the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspect to the State CIID for further investigation and prosecution.

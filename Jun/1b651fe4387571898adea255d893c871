Some angry residents of Yantumaki town in Danmusa Local Government Area of Katsina State, on Tuesday, burnt down a billboard bearing the photograph of President Muhammadu Buhari and the logo of the All Progressives Congress, APC. The irate protesters also burnt down banners with the image of the state Governor, Aminu Masari. It was gathered that the residents were protesting against the inability of their leaders to tackle the issue of insecurity in the state. Recall that some gunmen suspected to be bandits had a few days ago killed the District Head of Yantumaki in Danmusa Local Government Area of the state, Abubakar Atiku Maidabino. In a viral video online, the aggrieved youths were seen blocking some roads leading to Maidabino’s palace. A Twitter user by the name @Kabir_Kb1 wrote: “Angry protesters in Katsina set fire on @MBuhari and Masari banners, they were protesting the negligence of their leaders in curbing insecurity in their State.”  See video:

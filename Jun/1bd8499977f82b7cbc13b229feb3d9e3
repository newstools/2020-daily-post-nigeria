The Oyo State COVID-19 Task Force has relaxed the curfew imposed on the state following the ravaging coronavirus pandemic. The decision was made public after a meeting presided by its chairman, Governor Seyi Makinde. The curfew would now run from 10pm to 4am. Makinde’s spokesman, Taiwo Adisa, announced the decisions reached in a statement Monday night. They included the resumption of classes for Primary Six, JSS3 and SS3 students from Monday, June 29. Also approved was the resumption of work by all categories of workers at the state secretariat from June 22. The government has permitted the opening of mosques and churches to operate at 25 percent capacity. All worshippers are to compulsorily wear face masks, while the situation will be reviewed within the first two weeks. Furthermore, public gatherings have been limited to 25 persons. The state secretariat earlier shut on March 27 and later reopened to staff on grade level 13 and above from April 27, would now be open to all other staffers from Monday, June 22. The government said students in critical classes are to resume at the end of June to ensure they are well-prepared for the public examinations ahead. Adisa stated that schools are to “observe the COVID-19 protocols as released by the Task Force, ensure that stations for washing of hands are provided, while all students are to compulsorily wear face masks.” Schools were directed to provide hand wash points with the support of their Parents/Teachers Associations (PTA). The statement declared that night clubs are to remain shut. It added that the resumption order will not affect the tertiary institutions for now, as the Task Force would review their situation and determine their readiness.

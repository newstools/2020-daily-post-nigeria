Kaura Youth Coalition and National Association of Takad Youths on Saturday, told security agencies to dislodge a militia camp on Zangang Hill, Kaura LGA, Kaduna State. They raised the alarm in a joint statement signed by their Presidents, Derek Christopher and Abin Vincent, in Kafanchan. The groups alerted that the hill has become a breeding ground for militias, with over 600 armed men taking refuge there. They called on security outfits to “intensify efforts in dislodging the militia camp on the Zangang hill top, where over 600 militia are wielding heavy weapons”. The statement warned that it is at the location that the Takad, Fulani and Sholio natives are “unapologetically slaughtered at will, especially the killings that occurred in Zangang and Addu recently”. According to them, the purpose of the attacks is the mineral deposits and the green vegetation of the entire southern Kaduna. The youths condemned the plundering of their land by the militias, noting that illegal mining of tin was fast becoming the order of the day. “There is also an ongoing illegal mining of tin being carried out by the natives of Ganawuri; they usually sell the products in Jos, Plateau.’’ They, however, hailed security agencies on the recent arrest of two Ganawuri and three Fulani militia, allegedly caught removing roofs of buildings in Zangang. The youths requested the Police in Kaura to step up investigations and ensure the arrest and prosecution of people terrorising their community. The statement urged the Kaduna government to create additional police outposts and increase military presence in Southern Kaduna.

The NDLEA Head of Public Affairs, Mr. Jonah Achema, disclosed this in a statement on Monday in Abuja. Achema said that the illegal substance was conveyed in a 30T HOWO truck heading to Abuja. He said:” When an officer got on the truck to confirm its content, the driver engaged the engine and drove away with the officer still in the truck. “Seeing what was happening, the members of the team mobilized and pursued the truck. “When the pursuit intensified, the driver and one other person who were in the vehicle jumped off the vehicle and escaped. “However, some items and documents belonging to the suspects were discovered. “We also have the vehicle number plate, a telephone and some other documents that were recovered from the truck which will be used for further investigations. ”The two suspects are Ibrahim, also known as Ade Bendel, from Edo but based in Abuja and Abor Bello, who is a driver from Edo.’ However, the State Commander, Mr Alfred Adewunmi, also assured Nigerians that the NDLEA would ensure that all suspects are arrested. ”The agency is making efforts to ensure that those who were still in the drug business were brought down to face the consequences. “The public should not hesitate to call on the agency the suspects are seen , adding that the fight against drug abuse and trafficking was everyone’s business. “As the crack-down on drugs continues, it is only expected that all stakeholders will ensure cooperation so as not to undermine the need to bring these illicit drug criminals to book,” he added.

A family court, in Benin, Edo State, on Thursday, sentenced one Mohammed Aliu, 28, to 10 years imprisonment for defiling a ten-year-old girl. The Chief Magistrate of the court, Mrs Adamaigbo Dorothy sentenced the defendant, after he had pleaded guilty to the charge. The state Prosecutor, Mary Imhodemhe had earlier told the Court that the accused committed the offence on May 23, at Evbukhu community, a sub-urban town along Sapele road in the State. According to Imhodemhe, the defendant threatened to stab the minor, before unlawfully defiling the ten-year-old girl. ‘This offence contravened section 218 of the Criminal Code , Cap 48,Vol. II, Laws of the defunct Bendel state of Nigeria 1976 as applicable in Edo,” he said. The Chief Magistrate, however, found the defendant guilty and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment based on the convict’s statement and evidence of medical report on the victim.

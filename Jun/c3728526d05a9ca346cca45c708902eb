The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has declared that it was investigating Ramoni Igbalode aka Hushpuppi and his Nigerian friends for many alleged cybercrime cases. The Nigerian was arrested by the International Police (Interpol) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Hushpuppi was nabbed on Wednesday, June 10, 2020, in the United Arab Emirates in connection (UAE) with a $35million ventilator scam. EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale, said this in a statement sent to DAILY POST Thursday night. He noted that the commission is “Familiar with grisly details of his money laundering transactions, involving many high-profile cyber criminals facing trial in Nigeria.” EFCC disclosed that it is “engaging with the FBI in tracing victims of his fraudulent transactions and other fraudsters having direct involvement with him.” The commission added that local cybercriminals with money laundering networks with Hushpuppi are also being investigated.

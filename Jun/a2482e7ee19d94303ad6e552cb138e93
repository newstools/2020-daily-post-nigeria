The recruitment of special constables to pilot the community policing policy of the Nigeria Police Force will commence this week in Ogun State. This was disclosed on Wednesday by the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson. According to Ebrimson, the special police constables will help in fighting crimes at the grassroots. Speaking after the inauguration of the new state Chairman of the Police Community Relations Committee (PCRC), Samson Popoola, the police boss declared that the recruitment would start immediately after arrangements might have been concluded at the Area Command, Local Government Areas and the divisional levels, this week. He disclosed that the special constables would be trained on police operations, adding that they would be given police uniform. However, the commissioner said their badge would be different from that of the regular policemen. “When recruited, they will be given the police uniform but the only difference will be the signal, the badge, so that one can give them that sense of belonging.” Speaking further, he added that the special constables would help the command in preventing crime, give intelligence report, while also resolving crisis among members of their communities. “All other strata of the community policing, the Area Command, the Local Government Area and the divisional level will be concluded without any doubt this week. Thereafter we will now start with a pilot scheme of the recruitment of the constabulary. “So, in no distance time when all these level of advisory committee of the community policing has finalised we will now see the next level will now be the consolidation of the recruitment of the special constables,” Ebrimson declared. He stated that the constabulary would be sent to a modicum training of the police operation, adding that this “will translate to bringing them in as part of our partners.”

Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has said the operations of commercial motorcycles in the State may be banned. Governor Abiodun said this during a press conference he addressed on Friday at his Okemosan office, Abeokuta. The threat to ban commercial motorcyclists, popularly known as Okada riders, is because of their flagrant disobedience to the COVID-19 restriction order, Abiodun said. According to him, the state allows an Okada rider to carry only one passenger at a time during this pandemic. However, Abiodun said Okada riders have been breaking the law by carrying two passengers or more. Consequently, Abiodun stated emphatically that he will not hesitate to ban Okada riders if they continue to put his resolve to test. “Okada riders are to carry one passenger. But motorcyclists are breaking this law and I want to state emphatically that we will not hesitate to ban all okada motorcyclists from operating in our state if our resolve his further put to test. “If I continue to see Okada riders flouting this law, I will not hesitate to ban the operation of okada in this state henceforth,” he said. Governor Abiodun said the current ease of lockdown in the state should be maintained. “There will be no movement on Saturday and Sunday, while churches and mosques should remain under lock and key. “In the same vein, the ban on interstate travel continues as the dusk to dawn curfew also remains,” he said.

Barcelona coach, Quique Setien, has reacted to his side’s La Liga 2-2 draw against Celta Vigo on Saturday. He also explained why he benched forward, Antoine Griezmann, against Celta Vigo. Barcelona and Celta played a draw at the Municipal de Balaidos following goals from Luis Suarez (2), Fyodor Smolov (1) and Lago Aspas (1). “We controlled a large part of the game, but we failed to score more goals,” Setien said at his post-match press conference. “The consequences have been fatal, Celta Vigo’s equalizer hurt us a lot. “We lacked the ability to keep hold of the ball in the last minutes.” On why he benched Griezmann, Setien added: “I do not care if signings are expensive or cheap. These are technical decisions that I make thinking they can be the best for the team.”

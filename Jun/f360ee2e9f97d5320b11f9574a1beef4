Edo State Commissioner for Information, Paul Ohonbamu, has resigned his appointment from Governor Godwin Obaseki’s cabinet. He announced his resignation in a letter addressed to Obaseki on Thursday. Ohonbamu explained that he decided to step aside as cabinet member and operate outside for the general good of Edo. He thanked the governor for the opportunity given to him to serve the state. “I am particularly delighted that His Excellency’s second term bid is firm and surefooted. Whether we shall meet again I know not, therefore, our everlasting farewell take. If we do meet why we shall smile, if not it is true this parting was well made,” he said. The development comes weeks after Taiwo Akerele left Obaseki. He was the Chief of Staff to Governor Obaseki. There are speculations that more Obaseki’s appointees would leave the cabinet before June 22. The date has been set for All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary.

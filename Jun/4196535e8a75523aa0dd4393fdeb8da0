Nigerian singer, Gabriel Oche Amanyi, popularly known as Terry G has reacted to the backlash by Nigerians over the reported arrest of popular Instagram sensation, Ray Hushpuppi. Hushpuppi was reportedly arrested in the early hours of Wednesday by Interpol at the United Arab Emirates. He was alleged to have been nabbed after allegedly diverting COVID-19 funds up to the tune of $35 million. His arrest has since been met with backlash from Nigerians.
Speaking on the development, Terry G took to his Instagram page, appealing to Nigerians slamming Hushpuppi to pray for him. According to him, no one is clean or perfect. Alongside a picture of Hushpuppi, the Akpako master wrote: “None of us is clean nor perfect, all we pray is for God to ‘bo our asiri’ (Cover our secrets) pray for him.”<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-802483" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2FA6AEBD-4A92-42B5-B626-8C689273D648.jpeg" alt="" width="559" height="704" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2FA6AEBD-4A92-42B5-B626-8C689273D648.jpeg 559w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2FA6AEBD-4A92-42B5-B626-8C689273D648-238x300.jpeg.webp 238w" sizes="(max-width: 559px) 100vw, 559px">

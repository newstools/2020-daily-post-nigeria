Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has told his players that they can only win the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), if they remain humble. Nigeria have won their first two fixtures in the qualifying rounds, which was suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic. Rohr and his men will be looking to win the country’s fourth title next year. In an interview with Channels TV, Rohr warned the players that even qualification for the tournament has not been secured yet. “Let’s qualify first and I think we are on a good way to that and then, let’s stay humble if we want to win it. “I think we have a good team, we are already number three now in Africa. When I arrived, we were number 13. So we are on a good way but it needs time, and we even don’t know when the AFCON will hold.”

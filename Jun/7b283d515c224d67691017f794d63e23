A former Governor of old Kaduna State, Balarabe Musa, has told President Muhammadu Buhari to go after those behind the annulment of June 12, 1993 presidential election without further delay. Musa spoke at the commemoration of Democracy Day in Kaduna on Friday, insisting that those who annulled the polls were responsible for the many challenges facing Nigeria today. The former Governor commended Buhari for honouring the adjudged winner of the election late MKO Abiola but maintained that the President should complete the task he started. He called on Buhari to investigate the circumstances leading to the annulment, fish out those responsible and punish them to guide against future occurrence. “If President Muhammadu Buhari does not go further and do this, anybody can do same thing that Babangida did and got away with it; up till now, he (Babangida) is getting away with it. We must make sure that does not happen,” he said. The Kaduna-based politician also said that Nigerian leaders must do something fundamental in changing the socio-economic, political and cultural system controlling all development in this country. He said to achieve this, Nigeria must embark on socialist reconstruction, which would start with the leading role of the economy, “to ensure equality, justice, dignity of human and progressive development.”

Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum has ordered the reopening of three Secondary Schools in Bama town. Bama Local Government Area is about 60km from Maiduguri, the Borno State capital and the second largest town in the state. Bama however, suffered untold hardship at the height of the Boko Haram insurgency when the terrorists overran the town killing hundreds of people before it was liberated by the Nigerian military. Since the return of civil authority in the town, schools have remained closed as a result of pockets of attacks by the dreaded Islamic sect. However, when the governor visited the area yesterday, he ordered the reopening of three schools to enable students of the area to have access to education. Governor Zulum, who was in Bama to supervise the distribution of food items, announced plans to reopen three secondary schools at the Shehu of Bama Palace in Bama. This move according to the governor was to enable students continue with their education. Although some see this move as too early especially with recent attacks by Boko Haram and the COVID-19 pandemic, the governor said there could never be a better time to reopen school than now.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State has picked Worgu Boms, a former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in the state, as a replacement for Victor Giadom, for the party’s vacant post of the Deputy National Secretary. Giadom resigned his position as the party’s National Deputy Secretary in 2018 to run for the 2019 governorship election as a running mate. The development was disclosed to newsmen at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja on Saturday by the National Vice Chairman South-South, Hon. Hillard Eta.

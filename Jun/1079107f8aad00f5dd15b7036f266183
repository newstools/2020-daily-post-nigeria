A 20-year-old man, Peter Moses, who allegedly defiled a five-year-old girl, has been remanded at the Correctional Centre by an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistrates’ Court. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Adefumike Anoma, however, adjourned the case until July 21 for mention. Moses is standing trial on a count charge of rape. The Prosecutor, Insp. Monica Ikebuilo told the court that the defendant committed the offence on June 2 in Ado-Ekiti. Ikebuilo said the defendant defiled the five-year-old girl, adding that the victim’s parents were neighbours with the defendant. She said that the offence contravened Section 31 (2) of Child’s Right Laws of Ekiti, 2012. The prosecutor, therefore, urged the court to remand the defendant in the correctional centre pending legal advice from the office of Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). The plea of the defendant was not taken in court.

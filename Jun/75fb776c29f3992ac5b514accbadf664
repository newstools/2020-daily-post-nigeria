Lille striker, Victor Osimhen, is not considering a move to the Premier League this summer, according to his agent Osita Okolo. Osimhen was signed by the Ligue 1 club last summer, after Nicolas Pepe left for Arsenal. The Nigerian frontman enjoyed an impressive debut in France, scoring 18 goals and providing six assists, before the season was ended prematurely last month. Osimhen’s fine form has attracted interest around Europe, with top English clubs like Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur keen on him. However, it now appears the 21-year-old would rather move to Italy. “I can say that, for now, Osimhen hasn’t agreed anything with Napoli or another club,” Okolo told Radio Marte. “I can also deny that he dreams of going to the Premier League, I don’t know why [the press] says certain things. Naples is a fantastic city and Napoli are a very good team.”

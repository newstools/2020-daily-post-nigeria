Tension heightened on Saturdayâ€™s night at the Ondo State Government House in Alagbaka, Akure after the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi was prevented from leaving the Government House by the Commissioner of Police, Salami Bolaji. DAILY POST gathered that the security operatives were acting out the order of the Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The Deputy Governor was alleged to have looted government property from his lodge in his bid to take them to his personal house within the state capital. The move against Ajayi was not unconnected to his planned defection from the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, that is expected to take place on Sunday. In a video obtained by DAILY POST, the deputy governor was seen exchanging words with the Commissioner of Police, Salami Bolaji at the gate of the Government House as he was prevented from leaving. He said it was unfortunate that the police were being used in the ongoing political battle in the state.

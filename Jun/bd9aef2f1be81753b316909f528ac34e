The Speaker, Bauchi State House Assembly, Alhaji Abubakar Suleiman, has told legislators to submit themselves for the COVID-19 test. Abubakar made the call at the special plenary on Monday on the spread of the virus in the state. He said this while confirming that the member representing Toro/Jama’a Constituency, Alhaji Tukur Ibrahim tested positive to coronavirus. “He is receiving treatment; we are praying for his quick recovery so he can reunite with his family and legislators. “Samples of members are being taken for the COVID-19 tests; other members, whose samples have not been taken, should meet the medical personnel who are already in the House.” Sulaiman also called on the legislators and the general public to maintain the protocols on coronavirus, to stop further spread of the disease. “Such protocols include social distancing, regular hand washing with running water, use of face masks among others,” he added. The speaker noted that the assembly would do everything possible to curb further spread of the dreaded virus in the state.

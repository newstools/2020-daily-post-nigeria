Manchester United defender, Luke Shaw, has said the entire squad was “really happy” after Odion Ighalo’s loan deal was extended. Ighalo has signed a new contract with the Red Devils until January 2021. The Nigerian striker arrived in January this year and has impressed at Old Trafford, scoring four times in eight appearances. The COVID-19 break in football led to uncertainty about Ighalo’s future, but that has now been resolved. Shaw told United’s official website: “All the players are happy for him. “Obviously, his situation was up in the air and we try not to talk about that kind of thing at training but we’re just so happy for him.”

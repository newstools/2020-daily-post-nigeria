A faction of the All Progressive Congress (APC) in Cross River State has suspended the National Vice Chairman, South-South, Ntufam Hilliard Etta from the Party. In a press release issued on Thursday by the State Secretary, Chief Francis Ekpenyong and made available to DAILY POST, the party said the meeting was to formally announce the suspension of Ntufam Hilliard Etta for anti-party activities. The party alleged that Ntufam Etta has factionalised the party and created parallel structures in the state which offends the provisions of article 21 (a) (1) (11) and (vi) of the constitution of APC, 2014, as amended and is punishable under article 21 (D) (1) (a) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) and (j) of the same constitution. “His suspension followed due process and came on the heels of complaints of anti-party activities in his ward by a member of his ward Mr Andem Okokon. The ward five executive committees of the party set up a fact-finding committee to hear and determine the complaint. “Upon the receipt of the report of the fact-finding committee/disciplinary committee, the ward five executive committee ratified the report of the committee and transmitted its decision to the Calabar Municipal Chapter executive committee which also ratified the decision to the state executive committee of our party “The position of the party has since been communicated to Ntufam Hilliard Etta through correspondence both by the ward and the state structures and we are surprised that Ntufam Hilliard Etta has ignored the party’s position and has carried on, parading himself as the acting National Chairman of our great party with impunity. “By his suspension from the membership of our great party, his rights and privileges as a member of our great party are temporarily terminated until his suspension is lifted” the group stated. When contacted via phone on Thursday, the Publicity Secretary of one of the factions which Ntufam Hilliard Etta belonged to, Mr Bassey Ita said the group that addressed the press was illegal and should be discountenanced.

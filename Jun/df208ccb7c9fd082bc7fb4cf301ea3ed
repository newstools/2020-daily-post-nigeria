The Presidential Task Force, PTF, on COVID-19 has expressed displeasure over the concert held by Naira Marley on Saturday in Abuja, despite the ban on large gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic. The PTF National Coordinator, Dr. Sani Aliyu, made this known on Monday during the daily COVID-19 briefing. Aliyu said the singer’s fate will be determined by the Federal Capital Territory Administration, adding that the PTF will support any sanction made against the musician. He said: “With regards to the fate of Naira Marley, I believe the FCT authorities have already taken action with regards to the chief organizers. “But the decision on whether or not he will face penalties is actually a decision of the FCT authorities. “The PTF will always support any measure taken against people who continue to flout the directives we have put in place, particularly if they are putting public health at risk.” However, the Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, Chikwe Ihekweazu, while speaking said there are no plans to track those who attended the concert. He said: “On the plan whether we are going to trace the people that attended that concert, no. “We have more important work to do than to do that, but if we have a lot of positive cases from that community, then we have a problem. “We would have a problem if someone that went to that gathering turns positive. “We hope that doesn’t happen.” Recall that the Singer hosted a ‘Drive-in’ concert on Saturday night at Jabi Lake Mall amidst the coronavirus virus pandemic. The event, however, attracted criticisms from Nigerians as the attendees were clustered in a viral video, while Naira Marley performed despite an increase in coronavirus cases. Reacting to the development, the Federal Government on Monday suspended the flight that conveyed the artist to the venue for the concert.

President Muhammadu Buhari in a letter to the Nigerian Senate has replaced the dead nominee on the board of the Federal Character Commission from Kwara State. The letter which was read on the floor of the Senate by its President, Dr Ahmad Lawan on Tuesday, confirmed officially that the Kwara State FCC nominee died on May 19th. Buhari in the letter named Mr. James Gia Kolo as his replacement. Part of the letter reads: “In compliance with provision of section 154, subsection 1 of the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, I have the pleasure to present for confirmation by the senate, Mr James Gia Kolo as a member representing Kwara State in the Federal Character Commission (FCC), replacing the nominee earlier sent for the state, Mr Daniel James Kolo who died on 19th May 2020,” he said. The development is coming three weeks after the President replaced Tobias Okwuru, a former House of Representatives member, who was meant to serve on the FCC board. In the report earlier laid on Tuesday, Senate Committee Chairman on the Federal Character Commission and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator Danjuma La’ah revealed that a certificate of death of the Kwara nominee has been made available, hence, Senate should consider the replacement.

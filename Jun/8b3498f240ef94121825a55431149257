Chelsea have agreed contract extensions with Willian and Pedro until the end of the season. Both players were set to be free agents from June 30. However, the UK Sun reports that they will sign short-term extensions in order to help play a part in the Blues’ domestic season run-in. Neither player can join a new team until the transfer window reopens and both will be risking injury by playing for Frank Lampard’s side if selected. Pedro has already agreed to terms on a move to Roma where he will sign a two-year contract. Willian’s future remains up in the air, but Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur are believed to be keen.

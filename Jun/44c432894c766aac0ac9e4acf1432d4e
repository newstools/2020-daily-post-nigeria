The All Progressives Congress (APC) chairman in Etsako West Local Government of Edo, Mrs Rabiat Ezolomhe, has stated she and her members still remain in the party. She spoke while addressing newsmen in Auchi on Friday. NAN quoted her as declaring that APC was their home and they will not abandon it. National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, is from Etsako West. As Governor Godwin Obaseki defected to decamp to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), APC members have been decamping too. Ezolomhe said: “We learnt that people are saying that we left the party. We are not leaving APC, it is our home, we cannot destroy the house that we built.” The chairman said they “can’t run away from the house we laboured for since 2018, our tenure is not over yet, these are my members right here with me. Ezolomhe assured that as members of the Local Government Areas, “we remain members of the ruling party, we are authentic members of APC”. “Nobody can take away our position from us. We are not following anybody to any party. Our party is APC,” she said. APC chairman of Ward 10 in Etsako West Local, Mr Stephen Oshawo, also said that they were still APC members. Meanwhile, the PDP is set to screen Obaseki for the party’s primary.

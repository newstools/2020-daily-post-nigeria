A Jigawa State Higher Court sitting in Birnin Kudu Local Government, on Thursday, remanded 11 suspects over alleged rape of a12-year-old girl in Dutse Local Government. DAILY POST reported that police in Jigawa State had arrested eleven suspects over alleged rape of a 12-year-old old girl. The Prosecutor narrated to the court that, the accused persons allegedly lured the girl and had an unlawful carnal knowledge with the victim at different times and threatened to kill her if she disclosed the incident to anybody. He said the offence was contrary to section 282(1) of panel code law of Jigawa State. Defence counsel, Bar. AG Wakil said the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the case, therefore, requested the court to grant bail to the accused persons pending when the case was transferred to the appropriate court. Prosecuting counsel, who is also the State Attorney General, Dr. Musa Adamu Aliyu, disputed the bail application made by the defence counsel. Presiding Judge, Justice Musa Ubale, therefore, rejected the application filed by the defence counsel. He, however, ordered for remand of the suspects at the correctional centre for two weeks. The case was adjourned to Thursday, June 25, 2020, for further hearing.

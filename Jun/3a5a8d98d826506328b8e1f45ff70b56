Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has condoled with the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi over the death of his elder brother, Dede Amaechi. Wike’s condolence is contained in a statement signed by Mr. Paulinus Nsirim, Rivers Commissioner for Information and Communications, on Saturday in Port Harcourt. The governor described the demise of the deceased as a great loss not only to the family but the entire State. He, however, prayed to God to grant the Minister and his family the fortitude to bear the loss. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has already condoled with Rotimi Amaechi and his family over the death of Dede Amaechi. Buhari said: “In this moment of grief, our thoughts and prayers are with the Amaechi family and people of Rivers State.”<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803199" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wike-ameachi.jpg" alt="" width="602" height="389" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wike-ameachi.jpg 602w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/wike-ameachi-300x194.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px">

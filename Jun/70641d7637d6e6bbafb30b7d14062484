The All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to an ex parte order granted in favour of Deputy National Secretary, Victor Giadom. On Saturday, APC stated that none of the four defendants named on the said documents were served with the originating summons in the suit. A statement by APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, said Justice Liman of the Federal High Court had on March 13, 2020, affirmed the appointment of Sen. Abiola Ajimobi as Acting Deputy National Chairman. It said the court granted an order of interim injunction restraining the defendant either by itself or its agents refusing to recognize Waziri Bulama as Ag. National Secretary, Ajimobi as Ag. Deputy National Chairman (South) and Paul Chukwuma as Ag. National Auditor. APC said complying with Article 14.2 (iii) of the APC Constitution, Ajimobi assumed the position of acting National Chairman on March 13, 2020. “In essence, there was no vacancy to fill on the said March 16, 2020, as Sen. Ajimobi had already assumed the role of Acting National Chairman. APC assured its members that the APC has no leadership vacuum. It said by the party’s constitution, Ajimobi has assumed the role of National Chairman following the decision of the Court of Appeal upholding the interlocutory injunction suspending the National Chairman from office. “A majority of members of the NWC are determined to preserve our Party’s zero tolerance for impunity and will continue to uphold the law in fulfilment of the mandate given to us by members of our great Party”, Issa-Onilu said.

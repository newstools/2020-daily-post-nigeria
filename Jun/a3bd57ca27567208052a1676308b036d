There was a mild drama at an Akure Magistrate Court, Ondo State following the appearance of two human heads allegedly severed by suspected grave diggers. The human heads were presented to the court as exhibits in the ongoing trial of the suspected grave diggers who were allegedly caught with the human heads. DAILY POST had reported the arrest of some grave diggers after they were caught digging out a corpse buried in a cemetery at Imafon, Akure, the Ondo State capital. Following the trial of the suspects, they were ordered to be remanded in police custody after their bail applications were rejected by the Presiding Magistrate, Tope Aladejana. The Magistrate also ordered that their case file be sent to the Office of Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice following the request of the Police Prosecutor, Inspector Uloh Goodluck. Earlier, the Counsels representing the defendants, Femi Adetoye and Jide Agboola had prayed the court to grant the suspects bail as they argued that the offense is a bailable offense. Their request was subsequently turned down by the Magistrate.

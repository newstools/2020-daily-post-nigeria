Canadian Pop singer, Justin Brew Bieber has filed a $20 million lawsuit against two women who accused him of sexual assault on social media. According to TMZ, the women who go by the name danielleglvn and ItsnotKadi on Twitter had on the 20th of June alleged that Bieber sexually assaulted them between 2014-2015. Danielle who first posted on Twitter alleged that Bieber sexually assaulted her in a Four Seasons hotel in March of 2014. She wrote “Justin had made me agree to not say anything to anyone, or I can get in serious legal trouble. “He then asked me to join him in bed. That’s when I asked myself, how in the world is this normal?” Also, on the same day, the second woman identified as Kadi claimed that Bieber’s bodyguard, Mikey invited her up to his hotel room after a New York City meet-and-greet in May 2015, and sexually assaulted her. “I asked him to stop and continued to say that I cannot have sex with anyone prior to marriage,” Kadi said. Meanwhile, Bieber vehemently denied both Danielle and Kadi’s allegations by sharing news articles, social media photos, screenshots of emails, and lodging receipts from the time in question to counter the allegations against him. According to him, he never stayed at the Four Seasons, where one of the women claimed the alleged incident took place. He also said he spent the night of March 9, 2014, at an Airbnb and March 10, 2014, at the Westin with his then-girlfriend, Selena Gomez. However, the singer through his lawyers sued the two women for defamation, stating that the accusations against him are factually impossible and disproven both by indisputable documentary evidence and the individual’s own admissions. The suit also claims that the women “fraudulently schemed to seek attention and fame by maliciously posting despicable, blatantly false, fabricated, defamatory accusations that Bieber had engaged in sexual assault.

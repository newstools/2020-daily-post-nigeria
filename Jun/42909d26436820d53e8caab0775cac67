Two men have died in fatal multiple road accidents that occurred at the Isara bridge axis along the diversion area of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State. 11 other men sustained various degrees of injuries in the accident that involved 23 persons. The accident, which occurred around 9:50am on Monday, involved four vehicles: a Toyota bus marked, BEN 133 YQ and three Man-diesel trucks with registration numbers, KFU 101 LG, QAP 584 XA and LSD 759 XR. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps told DAILY POST that the accident was caused by wrongful overtaking and reckless driving on the part of the Man-diesel marked LSD 759 XR, moving from Lagos to Ibadan. TRACE Spokesperson, Babatunde Akinbiyi, said “The Man-Diesel, which caused the unfortunate mishap was outbound Lagos-Ibadan, when in an attempt to overtake the vehicle in its front, closed with the other three vehicles in the opposite direction.” The vehicles were reportedly coming from Niger State to Lagos. The two dead victims, it was learnt, were among the occupants in the commercial bus. DAILY POST reports that the injured victims have been rescued to Victory Hospital, Ogere Remo and Idera Hospital Gateway Trailer Park, while the dead were deposited at FOS Mortuary, Ipara Remo. The vehicles involved have also been taken to the Police MTD, Ode Remo. “While TRACE Corps commiserate with the family of the deceased, drivers of articulated vehicles are again admonished to be safety conscious, especially at diversion zones, more so that the rains are here again,” Akinbiyi added

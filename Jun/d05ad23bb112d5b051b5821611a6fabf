APC had cleared Dr. Pius Odubu, Hon. Osaro Obaze and Mr. Osagie Ize-Iyamu to contest the primaries. The APC National Working Committee, headed by Sen. Abiola Ajimobi, the Deputy National Chairman, South, performed the ceremony on Thursday at the APC’s National Secretariat in Abuja. Recall that a seven-member election committee is headed by Gov.

Ajimobi, who was represented by Mr. Hilliard Eta, the APC’s National Vice Chairman, South/South, disclosed that the committees’ job was to carry out the process of selecting the party’s flag bearer, who would contest on September 19, Edo governorship election. He said: “Their job is very simple, to carry out the process of selecting the flag bearer of the party in Edo State. “We know that after that exercise, there may be concerns and disagreements. That’s why we have constituted members of the APC Governorship Primary Election Appeal Committee. “I inaugurate these two committees with the powers that have been conferred on me by the very generous members of the National Working Committee (NWC), who chose Sen. Ajimobi, on whose behalf, I perform this function.” The primary election committee members include Governor Hope Uzodinma (Chairman), Senator Ajibola Bashiru (Secretary).

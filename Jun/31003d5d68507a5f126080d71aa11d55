Convener of pro-democracy group, Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju has given reason he would not run for any political office in Nigeria. Adeyanju, on Monday, said many Nigerians at the grassroots level will not allow him run for any political office because they do not believe in ideas or big grammar but just money to vote in anyone. He added that he doesn’t have millions of Naira to waste, hence ‘laughs’ whenever people advise him to contest. The activist disclosed this on his Twitter page, stressing that the real problem in Nigeria is those at the grassroots level. His tweets read: “When I hear people advise me to run for political office, all I do is laugh. Do I have 100 or N200m to waste? In Nigeria, the grassroots does not want to hear big grammar or bright ideas. All they want is money -Party agents, etc. “We are not ready and we have too many issues in Nigeria. “When I see people lying to themselves and others on social media about elections in Nigeria and giving false hope that does not exist, I just laugh. The earlier we start telling ourselves the truth, the better. The real problem is in the grassroots.” DAILY POST had reported that one of the sons of former vice-president Atiku Abubakar, Adamu, announced that his father will run for president again in 2023. The former Vice President contested the last presidential election in 2019 under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and lost to the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari.

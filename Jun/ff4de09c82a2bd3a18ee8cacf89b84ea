Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has insisted he is not a candidate to become the club’s next chairman. The Premier League club are looking for a replacement after Sir Chips Keswick announced his decision to step down from the role. Sir Chips spent 15 years on the board and seven years as chairman, before deciding to depart. It leaves Stan Kroenke, Josh Kroenke, Lord Harris and Ken Friar on the board. Ex-Gunners defender, Martin Keown, is one of those that have called on the club to be handed the role. But speaking to beIN Sports, Wenger said: “The candidate says that he’s not a candidate.” The Frenchman is currently FIFA’s chief of global football development, after spending 22 years as Arsenal’s manager.

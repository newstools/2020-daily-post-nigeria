Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) play a major role in most economies, particularly in developing countries. It is safe to say that the future of Africa’s economy rests on SMEs, and this is because they provide a wide range of employment opportunities and also contribute significantly to countries’ GDP. However, since the inception of the COVID-19 crisis, SMEs have witnessed a spiral in consumer behaviour, as most of them have moved their commercial transactions online. In light of this, Flutterwave has created a convenient and easy way for SMEs to sell their products online with an e-commerce innovation known as the Flutterwave Store. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-801815 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png" alt="" width="446" height="446" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png 446w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-300x300.png 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-150x150.png 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-80x80.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px"> The main aim of this store is to act as an online gateway to enable SMEs to own an online store without the need for coding or website development. Even though this ground-breaking innovation for SMEs rose up as a response to the pandemic, the CEO of Flutterwave, Olugbenga Agboola, says that the service will still be available post-pandemic.

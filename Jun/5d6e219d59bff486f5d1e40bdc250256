Some alleged cultists arrested and paraded by the Nigerian Navy in Calabar, Cross River State have said they are not cultists as claimed by the Navy. Otobong Sam Peter, one of the suspects from Atimbo, Akpabuyo local government area of the state said the Navy raided and utterly destroyed his property on allegations that he and others found in his hotel were suspected cultists. Peter alleged that about 17 of his customers were rounded up in his hotel and beaten mercilessly at about 6.30pm on Sunday, May 24 and that the Navy also indiscriminately arrested other passers-by on the streets, mainly young men, between that Sunday and Monday morning. He said that after he identified himself as the owner of the hotel where the raid took place and sought to know what crimes they were arrested for, he was set free but that others arrested alongside him were not that lucky to escape additional humiliation as they were later paraded by the Navy as cultists. Mr Peter described the insinuation that cultists were arrested in his hotel during initiation as cooked up story by the Navy to cover up alleged dehumanization of Nigerians, most of whom, he said, had been released on bail by the Police who took custody of the suspects after being paraded by the Navy. Speaking with DAILY POST, the Information Officer, Nigeria Navy Ship Victory, Calabar, Sub Lt Ola Olaegbe said “We don’t have any issue with the Hotel, we have an issue with the suspected cultists who were in the Hotel for initiation. “We acted on a tip-off that the suspects were in the Hotel for initiation. During the profiling, some of them confirmed that they are suspected cultists and they were members of a particular cults group and were there for initiation. “We handed them over to relevant security agencies and we are not aware that they have been released and in any case, the Police are doing their work” but denied knowledge of any petition against the Navy.

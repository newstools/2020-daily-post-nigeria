Some airlines have dragged the British Government to court. This followed the rule that all travelers from abroad must self-isolate for 14 days. The only country exempted from the quarantine rule, which took effect on Monday June 8, is Ireland. Authorities said the measure would further curb the spread of coronavirus. On Friday, British Airways, Ryanair and Easyjet demanded an urgent judicial review of the quarantine rule. Dpa reports that the airlines urged the government to return to the previous rule requiring quarantine for arrivals from “high risk” countries. They warned that it will have “a devastating effect on British tourism and the wider economy and destroy thousands of jobs”. The companies said there was “no consultation and no scientific evidence provided for such a severe policy.”

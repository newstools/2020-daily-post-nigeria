Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said he wants Willian and Pedro to remain at the club. Speaking during a Zoom press conference on Friday, Lampard insisted he won’t have issues picking the two players for the Aston Villa game, despite their contracts expiring just nine days after the game. The Blues are currently in talks with Willian and Pedro about temporary extensions to their contracts. However, Pedro is believed to have reached a pre-contract arrangement with Italian giants Roma, which means he might not be available for upcoming fixtures. Willian hasn’t agreed a deal with another club, but the Brazilian is yet to agree on an extension until the end of the season. “We want them to extend their stay and make sure they can see out the season. “I’ve had nothing but open conversations with them. We’re just trying to make that extension happen. The players have to be happy. We have to be happy. “Hopefully, we can get there before the 23rd of June, next week, because that’s the day we have to get it done by,” Lampard said.

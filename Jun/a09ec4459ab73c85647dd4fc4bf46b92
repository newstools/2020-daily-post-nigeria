Premier League giants, Arsenal have offered to triple Atletico Madrid midfielder, Thomas Partey’s wages, Goal reports. Partey, who has a £44.5million release clause in his current contract with Atletico, had drawn the interest of Arsenal in recent weeks. The Ghanian international is now weighing up his options after receiving a huge contract offer from the Gunners. Arsenal is prepared to triple the wages Partey currently earns at Atletico if he agrees to join Mikel Arteta’s side this summer. Atletico has so far rebuffed Arsenal’s advances for Partey, but Diego Simeone’s side is now open to cashing in on the 27-year-old whose current contract at the club expires in 2023. Partey had said in the summer of 2018 that he was hopeful of playing in the Premier League, one day. He said: “The Premier League is good, it is very competitive and has some of the best players in the world. “Hopefully, one day. I want to play there.”

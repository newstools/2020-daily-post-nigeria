Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, was in Uyo, the capital of Akwa Ibom State, on Sunday. He had a meeting with Governor Udom Emmanuel at the Government House. The parley was held hours after Obaseki visited Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike in Port Harcourt. Since his disqualification by the All Progressives Congress (APC), Obaseki has been in touch with chieftains of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Vice President Atiku Abubakar reportedly spoke with him on phone after the party’s decision. Meanwhile, Obaseki has condemned the APC for upholding his exclusion from the June 22 primary election. The governor dismissed the Appeal Committee’s decision, noting that he never approached the panel to upturn his disqualification.

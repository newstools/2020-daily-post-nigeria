The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said a decision on the reopening of schools in the state, will be made in the next two weeks. Sanwo-Olu stated this during a media briefing on Thursday afternoon. “In two weeks, we would make a decision on the reopening of schools,” he said. According to Sanwo-Olu, “we are looking at the educational centres very differently”. The Governor also made it clear that “the state government will enforce compliance with all safety precautions”. Last week, the Lagos state Commissioner for Education, Folasade Adefisayo, said protocols were being put in place, to ensure the safety of students when school reopens. Adefisayi also hinted that students might not need to come to school daily. Lagos has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria with 5,440.

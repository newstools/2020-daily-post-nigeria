The immediate past representative of Arochukwu constituency in the Abia State Assembly and a chieftain of the All Progressives Grand Alliance( APGA), Luke Ukara Onyeani, has revealed the rationale behind the avalanche of defections currently hitting the Abia chapter of APGA. DAILY POST recalls that Luke Ukara Onyeani, alongside the immediate past Commissioner for Industry, and a PDP chieftain, Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh, had on Tuesday defected to the All Progressives Congress, (APC), in the state. But, addressing newsmen in Umuahia, on Thursday, Onyeani, insisted that APGA under Ozonkpu Victor Oye-led National Working Committee,(NWC), has derailed on the core ideologies under which the party was formed. He said members of APGA were witnessing injustice, sabotage and impunity, a situation he claims thwarted the chances of the party as allegedly witnessed in 2019 general elections across the Southeast and beyond. The ex-Abia lawmaker disclosed that all members of the party in the State House of Assembly had registered in the All Progressives Congress(APC) and would soon jump ship. Ukara Onyeani said “In APGA, we work with the APC. In 2015, we adopted the APC presidential candidate as our own presidential candidate. In 2019, even though we had a ‘presidential candidate,’ there was still an understanding that we will vote for APC presidential candidate”.

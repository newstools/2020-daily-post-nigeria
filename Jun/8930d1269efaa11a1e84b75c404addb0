The Federal Government has said schools who are running an international curriculum, will be allowed to write their third term exams online. This was confirmed by the Minister of State for Education, Emeka Nwajiuba, while speaking on Monday during the daily briefing of the Presidential TaskForce on COVID-19. According to Nwajiuba, this had become necessary, as there were private schools licenced to run foreign curriculum, especially for children of expatriates and diplomats. “Private Schools that run International Curriculum are free to conduct their third term examinations online. There are private schools licenced to run foreign curriculum essentially for children of expatriates and diplomats. “If such schools are able to host online classes for the curriculum they operate and they choose to use the period to cover their syllabus, it is permitted,” the Minister said.

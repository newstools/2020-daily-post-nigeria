Real Mallorca manager, Vicente Moreno, has vowed never to get into fights with Lionel Messi or anger the Barcelona captain again. Moreno said this ahead of his side’s La Liga clash against Barcelona on Saturday night at the Iberostar Stadium. According to him, he engaged in a heated outburst on the touchline with Messi back in December 2019, when the two teams met in La Liga, and the Argentine captain told him that Barcelona would score his team seven goals. However, Barcelona was unable to score seven goals against Mallorca in the encounter, but the Catalan club went on to win 5-2, with Messi grabbing three goals. “My players told me after the game that I had been the culprit for the defeat because I had angered Messi,” Moreno told Edu Pino on YouTube. “Messi was angry and, in the tunnel at the break, he told me they were going to score seven goals against us, and he told Luis Suarez that they had to score 7. “However, they didn’t manage to do it, but he scored a hat-trick. He’s the best player in the world. “Look at his genius, his character and his rage wanting to win and what happened gives it more value. “This time I’ll not get into fights. It’s no good for me.”

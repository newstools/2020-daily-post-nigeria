The Federal Government has issued a strong warning to states over reopening of schools across the country. DAILY POST had reported that some states had hinted that it will reopen schools soon. Cross River State Governor, Ben Ayade had last week ordered the gradual reopening of schools across the state. Ayade had directed that public schools in the state should resume on June 16, 2020. However, speaking on Monday, Boss Mustapha, Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 said the current situation of coronavirus did not in any way support such initiative. According to him, reopening of schools at this critical time could expose the general public to more danger. “We got reports that some states are considering reopening of schools, viewing centres and other gatherings that encourage large crown, such step is not encouraging at this moment. “PTF is emphasising that it’s not yet safe to do so. We need to be cautious and adhere to the PTF guideline.”

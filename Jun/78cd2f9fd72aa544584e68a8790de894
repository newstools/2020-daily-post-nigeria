Residents of Jalingo, Taraba State, struggled to save a military man from committing suicide on Thursday. Identified as Ali, he had climbed the Welcome to Taraba Tower. He threatened to jump to his death while speaking in Hausa and pidgin. The Nation quoted him as saying: “I want to die. Allow me to jump down and die.” Youths gathered and begged him not to carry out the act. An eye witness said they noticed someone climbing the Tower and pulling off his clothes. “We got there to discover he is someone we know. He was left with under pant and an inner vest and poised to jump. We went close and began to beg him,” he explained. A source said Ali has mental illness and has been relieved of his job. “He is an ex-soldier, fond of riding military motorbikes in town. He was sacked from the army when it was discovered he is mentally ill,” the source disclosed.

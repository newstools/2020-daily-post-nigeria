Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has criticized his players despite a 1-0 win over Leicester City in the FA Cup quarter-final on Sunday. Ross Barkley scored a second-half winner, as the Blues booked their spot in the last four, where they take on Manchester United at Wembley. Lampard admits he could have substituted most of his team at half time, claiming they got “lucky” in the game. The Chelsea boss took off Mason Mount, Billy Gilmour and Reece James at half time, following a poor display. “I could have made seven or eight subs at half time. We got lucky. If we turn up like that again we have no chance. “It was the worst we’ve played since I’ve been here. “The first half was not what we are used to in terms of our performance. We lacked urgency and intensity. I made three subs but it could have been more and different subs,” he told the media after the game.

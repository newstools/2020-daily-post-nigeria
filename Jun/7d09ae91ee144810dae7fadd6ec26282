The Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has described his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki’s departure from the All Progressives Congress, APC, as very painful. He expressed sympathy for the governor but insisted that notwithstanding his incumbency, the APC would take the state back from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Obaseki’s new party. The governor fielded questions from State House Correspondents on Monday evening, after a meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Professor Ibrahim Gambari by governors of the North-central states, at the Presidential Villa. “We have seen those in power before that were dethroned, we have seen practically that President Muhammadu Buhari of APC dethroned PDP, the former President that was on seat. So, that is not any trouble at all,” Bello boasted. “APC is going to win Edo State. But unfortunately, I really felt the leaving of my colleague, His Excellency Governor Godwin Obaseki, in whatever circumstance to another political party, it is painful anyway, but as a political party we are going to take it back,” he said. Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu will bear the APC’s flag in the governorship election after he was declared the winner of the Edo State party primaries with a total of 27,838 votes.

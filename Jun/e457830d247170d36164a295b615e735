The Federal Government has revealed when schools will reopen, amid the coronavirus outbreak in the country. Dr Osagie Ehanire, Minister for Health said schools will reopen when government is able to ensure balance in safety and preventing of COVID-19 explosion across the country. Schools, religious and public gatherings were banned about two months ago by the federal government due to the coronavirus outbreak. After months of closure, government, however, relaxed the ban on religious gatherings for four weeks while schools will remain closed. However, Ehanire, while addressing reporters during the 100th day briefing of the presidential task force on COVID-19 in Abuja, over the weekend said no date has been fixed for reopening of schools. The Minister said government would continue to monitor and study the situations with a view to deciding when to reopen schools. According to Ehanire: “There is no fixed date on schools’ resumption. The presidential task force on COVID-19 is studying the situation, carrying out reviews every two and four weeks to assess the situation and judge when it is safe. “The Federal Government is taking very seriously the balance between safety and preventing of disease explosion, and the opening of schools. “We are encouraging schools to embrace online training and education as much as possible. “As soon as the details are established and the risk of transmission is measured and established, then, schools will reopen.”

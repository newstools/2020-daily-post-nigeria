Former Manchester City midfield maestro, Yaya Toure, has predicted that the current Super Eagles squad can make Nigeria rule Africa again in the future. The Ivory Coast legend believes the emergence of new talents like Nantes’ Simon Moses, Lille’s Victor Osimhen and Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi, will help Gernot Rohr’s men retain their place among the best countries in Africa. “Nigeria has some interesting players coming through, like Moses Simon, Victor Osimhen, Wilfred Ndidi, and many more. “They have always been a force in Africa and the talents coming through will make them better in the future,” Toure was quoted by Brila.net as saying. Super Eagles have won the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) title three times in the past. They finished third-place at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt after defeating Tunisia 1-0, thanks to Odion Ighalo’s early first-half goal.

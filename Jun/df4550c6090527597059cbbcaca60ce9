The Director-General of the Progressives Governors Forum, Salihu Lukman, has said the crisis in the All Progressives Congress, APC, has exposed the failure of the party’s leaders in resolving issues. Lukman said the leadership crisis may be an indication that President Muhammadu Buhari, Bola Tinubu, Chief Bisi Akande, Chief Ogbonnaya Onu and Chief Tony Momoh are incapable of resolving the leadership crisis. In a statement he signed, Lukman lamented that APC was collapsing with no leader in charge. “How can a party so blessed with experienced and very skillful leaders such as Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Chief Bisi Akande, Chief Ogbonnaya Onu, Chief Tony Momoh, etc. be incapable of resolving the problem of leadership vacancy. “The combined moral authority of President Buhari and Asiwaju Tinubu should have involuntarily moderated the conduct of other leaders of the party, especially members of the NWC. “Does the current APC leadership crisis, therefore, suggest the declining moral authority of our two leaders? It is very easy to reach conclusions,” he said. An Appeal Court ruling suspending Adams Oshiomhole as the National Chairman of APC had led to a leadership crisis in the ruling party. Following the ruling, APC Deputy National Secretary Victor Giadom declared himself Oshiomhole’s replacement. However, APC National Working Committee, NWC, had appointed former Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi as acting chairman.

Former Liverpool and Real Madrid player, Michael Owen, has predicted Chelsea to beat Leicester City 2-1 in today’s FA Cup quarter-final clash at the King Power Stadium. Chelsea head to the game after beating Manchester City 2-1 in the Premier League in their last encounter, while Leicester City played a goalless draw with Brighton. Providing his prediction, Owen wrote in his column for BetVictor: “Leicester City was given a stern test by Championship side Birmingham City at the King Power Stadium before eventually running out 1-0 winners, while Chelsea was comfortable 2-0 winners over Liverpool in their fifth-round tie,” Owen told BetVictor. “I have been impressed with both of these teams so far this season. Brendan Rogers has got Leicester playing really well, and he is getting absolutely everything out of the team. “The Foxes are enjoying their best season since winning the title in 2015-16, and they already look to have secured their spot in next year’s Champions League, while Chelsea look favourites in their battle for fourth. “Chelsea’s ambitions were surely restricted with the transfer embargo in place so, if they could secure Champions League qualification and a Wembley appearance, it would definitely be seen as a decent season for them. “Chelsea have only recorded one win against Leicester in the last six meetings, and that victory came in the FA Cup. “The sides met at the King Power Stadium at the same stage of the competition in 2018 and Chelsea ran out 2-1 winners after extra time. I’m predicting the same result this weekend; a 2-1 away win for Frank Lampard’s Chelsea.” The match is scheduled for 1 pm.

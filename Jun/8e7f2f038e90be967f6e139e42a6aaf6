The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has admitted that the country might just be starting to experience COVID-19. NCDC Director-General, Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, stated this while speaking at the House of Representatives on Monday, when members of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) appeared before a joint committee of the House. “We are still in the middle of a very, very bad outbreak. In fact, it is most likely that we are at the beginning of a very bad outbreak. This is the honest truth. “And as we dig into the details of what we have done, I really crave your indulgence to please, bear in mind that we do this work together, because we really have a collective responsibility to our people,” the NCDC boss said. Ihekweazu also denied claims that the NCDC had spent millions on text messages to sensitise Nigerians. A total of 12,801 confirmed cases have been recorded in the country so far.

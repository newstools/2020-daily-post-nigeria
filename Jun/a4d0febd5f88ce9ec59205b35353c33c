Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will leave Paul Pogba on the bench, for this Friday’s Premier League clash at Tottenham Hotspur, according to The Athletic. Pogba has not featured for the Red Devils since Boxing Day, after suffering a foot injury. The Frenchman has made only eight appearances in all competitions this season. Pogba would have to wait to make a return, as Solskjaer is planning to leave him out for United’s first game since March. It is understood that the team has been preparing for the Spurs game without Pogba in the starting XI. Although match fitness might be an issue, United was also enjoying an excellent run of form before lockdown, going 10 games unbeaten across all competitions.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has lashed out at the Video Assistant Referee (VAR), following their 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Friday. Steven Bergwijn gave the hosts a 1-0 lead in the first half, after David De Gea failed to keep out his powerful shot. However, United levelled from the spot through Bruno Fernandes, after Paul Pogba was fouled in the area by Eric Dier. Referee Jon Moss awarded the Red Devils a late penalty, but VAR overruled the call. “I am unhappy with the VAR, not the referee on the first, the referee can make a mistake but VAR is there to do the job. “In the second I am unhappy with Jon Moss because he did not give the free kick leading up to it and then gave a penalty. In this case, the VAR gave the truth,” Mourinho told Sky Sports.

In the notice, the FIRS recalled that it had earlier mandated all companies operating in the Nigerian Oil & Gas Sector, to deduct VAT charged by their suppliers or contractors from the payments due and remit same to the service, but that it had observed that some companies were not complying with the notice to withhold and remit VAT, hence the need for further clarifications which came in form of a public notice.

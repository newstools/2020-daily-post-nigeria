At least 69 people were reportedly killed and a village razed to the ground in Borno northeast Nigeria on Tuesday afternoon by suspected members of the dreaded Islamic sect, Boko Haram. DAILY POST reports that the attack, which occurred at Faduma Koloram, a village in Gubio local government area of Borno State, took soldiers and members of the civilian joint task force unawares, according to sources in the area. “They arrived in vehicles and on motorcycles, shooting with AK-47s, razing the village, stole 1,200 cattle and camels,” a resident, a Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) member confirmed the account. According to the sources, the attackers pounced on the village because they suspected residents of sharing information on their movements with security authorities. “It’s an unfortunate day for us to witness this,” said CJTF fighter Kachallah Bumu. He said the residents were armed, and had repelled previous attacks, but this one caught them off guard. “They took us unawares and killed our people,” he said. Attempt to get military spokesman to speak on the attack did not yield result.

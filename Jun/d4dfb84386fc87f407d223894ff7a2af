Arsenal were ready to offer Willian a Â£250,000-a-week contract before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the UK Mirror reports. The Brazilian is out of contract at Chelsea this summer and it remains to be seen if the Gunners will follow through with a deal for the 31-year-old. Free agents usually get big deals, but Arsenal may struggle to hit that figure now. It is believed that contracts for free agents, could drop by 50 per cent and even better ones like Willian, Jan Vertonghen and Adam Lallana could get 25 per cent less. Willian is represented by super agent Kia Joorabchian, whose influence is growing at the Emirates. He was on target on Thursday night, as the Blues defeated Manchester City 2-1 to hand Liverpool the Premier League title.

Interpol has reportedly arrested popular Nigerian Instagram celebrity, Raymond Igbalodely also known as Hushpuppi. Hushpuppi was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday at the United Arab Emirates. He was alleged to have been nabbed after allegedly diverting coronavirus funds up to the tune of $35 million. The Real estate agent and his alleged fraud syndicate were said to have been on the radar of the Federal Bureau of Investigations, FBI, for a while now. However, some Nigerians have expressed their different opinions on the reported arrest of Hushpuppi. Tweets gathered by DAILY POST reads below: @aproko_doctor: “I’m happy that Hushpuppi has been caught. A lot of young people wanted his levels of questionable wealth, at least, now they know there are consequences. “Did you think his money was legit? If you do, I have one cream to sell to you that enlarges your penis with one single rub.” @Tee_Classiquem1: “Everyone wants to drag Hushpuppi because we already paint a narrative in our minds that he’s a fraudster even before this day, the sugar daddy that sleeps with you, do you know his source of income? The Chief that you befriend on your street, do you know how he’s making his cash?” @desh0la: “There is no real place like home….if only Hushpuppi was in Nigeria when interpol arrested him, shebi EFCC would have bailed him.” @AsiwajuLerry: “If you keep fraudsters as friends, you really need to slow down with the way you slander Hushpuppi. “God of Mompha” “God of Hushpuppi” Hope you guys are seeing God of Interpol and God of EFCC today?? @EWAWUNMIII: “Hushpuppi is a legit criminal flaunting his unknown wealth and peer pressuring young Nigerians to start doing fraud. He got what he deserved tbh!”

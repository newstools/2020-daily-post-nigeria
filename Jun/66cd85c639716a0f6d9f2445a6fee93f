Liverpool legend, Steven Gerrard, has named the club’s captain, Jordan Henderson, as the player that should win the English Premier League Player of the 2019/2020 campaign. The annual Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) Awards would have been scheduled to take place on April 26, but have naturally been postponed due to the spread of coronavirus across the globe. But Gerrard, who is currently the head coach of Rangers, believes the 30-year-old deserves the award because he is committed both on and off the pitch. Asked who should win the award, Gerrard told The Athletic: “If Henderson got it I do not think anyone could argue or grumble. “He would deserve it as much as anyone else who is in the running for it. “I try to be non-biased when I talk about things like this. Kevin De Bruyne has been superb this season. “The same goes for Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Jordan and Sadio Mane. Any of them would deserve it. Would I like to see Jordan win it? Yes, I would. “I would also like to see him win the Football Writers’ award. He is someone who commits himself to the game and is a real ambassador and role model on and off the pitch.”

Edo State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Anselm Ojezua, has said he will not be leaving the party with Godwin Obaseki. Ojezua was reacting to the resignation of Governor Obaseki from the APC. Obaseki was last weekend disqualified by the APC screening committee for discrepancies in his certificates. He formally announced his resignation shortly after meeting Buhari on Tuesday. Reacting, Ojezua told NAN that he would not move with the governor as he was elected as chairman of APC with a four-year mandate, which would expire in 2022. The party chairman said, “I won’t move. As you can see, I still have my mandate as the elected party chairman of APC in Edo which expires by 2020, and I intend to complete that mandate.” he added.

The National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, Barrister Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., has warned the embattled Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki against decamping to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Saturday announced the disqualification of Obaseki from the June 22 primary election. Governor Obaseki had vowed not to appeal the committee’s verdict. He is, however, reported to be consulting with Governors and key members of the opposition party as his supporters await his next decision. Bamgbose has also described Obaseki’s disqualification by the APC screening committee as very painful but advised the governor to note that defecting to any other party to contest the forthcoming governorship election, “won’t be a good option, no matter the pressure on him to do so.” “Defecting to another party, maybe politically disastrous for him at this crucial period of his political career,” Bamgbose warned. “He should see his disqualification as an act of God. His disqualification, unknown to him will preserve his life. Whoever occupies the position after him should watch it. Such may not finish his tenure. “Obaseki should jettison his intention to defect for whatever reason. Victory will be denied him even if he defects to another party. “Let him watch his utterances against his party, calling the Appeal Committee ‘a gathering of jesters’ may not be in the best interest of his political career. “He should reject any pressure to defect. He should remain in APC no matter what happens. Oshiomhole will one day leave as Chairman of APC. “The truth of the matter is that unknown to Oshiomhole, he has saved the life of the sitting Governor. It’s not yet over with Obaseki as a member of APC. “His disqualification is a great blessing in disguise. Defection should be ruled out completely. I hope he will listen to divine wisdom.”

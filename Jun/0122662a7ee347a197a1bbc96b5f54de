A Magistrate Court sitting in Port Harcourt has remanded the former Managing Director of the Rivers State Micro Finance Agency, RIMA Ipalibo Sogules. Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike had sacked Sogules along with 3 other heads of department over alleged fraud. DAILY POST reports that Chief magistrate A.O Amadi-Nna ordered the remand of Sogules and three others; Nimi Harry, Ukele Ujorji and Sofiri Koko who were charged with alleged conspiracy and advanced fee fraud of over thirteen million naira. Justice Amadi-Nna denied bail to the defendants despite several pleas from their Counsel. However, State Counsel, Chidi Ekeh, insisted that the defendants be remanded based on the two charges, adding that the court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the matter. The Chief Magistrate referred the case file to the Department of Public Prosecution, DPP for advise and adjourned the case to the 6th of July 2020 for mention.

Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, has urged Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to leave Emirates for another Premier League club, Aston Villa this summer’s transfer window. Aubameyang’s future at Arsenal remains uncertain. The Gabon captain is yet to agree on fresh terms with the Gunners and has been linked with an exit. His current contract with Arsenal runs out next summer. “I just want to say, Pierre, I hope you are at Aston Villa next year,” Willian was quoted by Metro UK as telling Aubameyang during a video chat. William added: “I have got to put that in there, just in case. “Mikel [Arteta] and I will have some words later.”

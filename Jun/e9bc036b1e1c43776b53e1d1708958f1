Following the allegation by the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi that members of the Ondo State House of Assembly have been financially induced by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to impeach him, the lawmakers have described the claim as false. According to the lawmakers, who described the Deputy Governor as a “drowning man” stated that they do not need to be induced before carrying out their constitutional responsibility. Recall that Ajayi had on Tuesday alleged that his boss, Akeredolu had been inducing the lawmakers with N10 million each for his impeachment. According to the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Olugbenga Omole, such allegation was not expected to have emanated from the caliber of the Deputy Governor. Omole, who reacted via a statement issued on Wednesday, described as reckless and a ploy to drag the lawmakers into the crisis between Ajayi and his boss. The spokesperson of the assembly who maintained that the allegation was smacks of naivety on the part of the Deputy Governor stated that the move was politics taken too far. “We are not surprised because he is a drowning man and he will hold on to anything to survive,” Omole stated.

Chelsea Manager, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that defender, Fikayo Tomori and forward, Callum Hudson-Odoi will both miss his side’s Premier League clash against Manchester City on Thursday night. According to Lampard, Tomori is a week away from training properly with the Chelsea squad, while Hudson-Odoi is still searching for match fitness. Chelsea will tonight host Pep Guardiola’s men at Stamford Bridge, following a 2-1 victory against Aston Villa in their last encounter. “We are all the same as we were for Aston Villa,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying at his pre-match press conference. “Fikayo Tomori is still probably about a week away from training properly with us, and Callum Hudson-Odoi is still searching for fitness. He’s fit but not fit yet for the match.” He added: “When you play against [Manchester] City, there are benchmarks for you. “We have to say as a club like Chelsea that we want to be at that level – competing for first and competing in cup competitions. “We have a job to do, and our job is to go up against one of the best teams in the world over the last few seasons and try to get a result.” The match is scheduled at 8:15 pm Nigerian time.

The Jigawa State Task Force on COVID-19 has disclosed that so far only 16 COVID-19 patients are currently in the stateâ€™s isolation centre. The Chairman COVID-19 State Task Force, Dr. Abba Zakar Umar, made this known in a statement issued to DAILY POST on Sunday. He said this is coming after the state discharged additional 23 patients after they recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. The chairman of the task force said the patients were discharged after their results returned negative for the second time. The state had recorded 317 COVID-19 cases out of which 301 have recovered and were discharged from the Isolation centre. DAILY POST reported that state government had lifted all the lockdown and suspension of markets following the decreasing number of COVID-19 cases in the state. Zakar, therefore, called on people to continue observing social distancing, use of face mask and hand sanitizers as means of preventing the spread of the deadly virus.

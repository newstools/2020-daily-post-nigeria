The Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) in Cross River State has warned the state government against its plan to commence a trial resumption of schools. The Cross River government plans to open three public schools in each of the three Senatorial Districts across the State on June 16th. But NMA in a press release signed by its Chairman, Dr Agam Ayuk and the Secretary, Dr Ezoke Epoke said the plan by the state government to commence a trial resumption of three public schools is worrisome. The Association maintained that the quick resumption of schools, despite genuine reasons, has the potential of triggering disease outbreak among students. NMA, however, called for the adoption of educational technologies to provide remote learning opportunities and educational programmes for students in public schools in the interim. The statement read in part: “The declaration by the Cross River Government on a trial resumption of three public schools in each of the three Senatorial Districts in the State to commence on June 16, 2020, is alarming.” Despite its disagreement with government’s decision, the association pledged to support the state in fighting COVID-19 “The Association and her members remain committed to working with the state and the Federal Government to fight the COVID-19 pandemic,” It added.

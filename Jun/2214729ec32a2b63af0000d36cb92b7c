Wife of Governor Nasiru Ahmad El-Rufai of Kaduna State, Aisha-Ummi Garba El-Rufai, has suggested for tougher punishment for rapists in the country. According to Aisha-Ummi Garba El-Rufai, all hands must be on deck in the fight against rape, stressing that everyone’s help is required in the fight against rape. She strongly suggested that unless the laws on the legal punishment for rape are changed, sexual predators and rape perpetrators would always keep destroying people’s lives without any serious consequences. Aisha, a UNICEF Ambassador for Nutrition & Breastfeeding, and Chairperson KADENAP, said on her social media account that heads have to roll instantly for such monsters to be repelled. She lamented, “The existing laws are such that each state is autonomous in its dispensation of criminal laws.” She suggested that the country needs to begin the unrelenting advocacy and tenacious movement for each state in Nigeria to adopt extremely harsh laws, execution and punishment for rape offenders. Aisha-Ummi Garba El-Rufai opined that it might be difficult and slow for the country to get 2/3rds of the National Assembly to vote for and pass these appropriately severe punishments into law. She noted that even if this happens, it remains the independent right of each state to either adopt or ignore the bill if passed – at their own pace and convenience. She expressed the hope that the father in every Governor, the parent in every lawmaker and policy influencer would support and help protect the girls, boys and women from rapes and brutal violations. Aisha-Ummi Garba El-Rufai stated that everyone and anyone who can help, can collectively put in all efforts and pursue this tenaciously until something is done on how to tackle and stop rape tragedies in our societies.

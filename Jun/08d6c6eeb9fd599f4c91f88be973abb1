Adamawa State on Tuesday marked 16 days of no COVID-19 infection. The government also stressed that the state currently does not have an active case “The last time any infection was confirmed in the state was 16 days ago,” the state Commissioner of Health, Prof Abdullahi Isah, said at an event in the state capital, Yola. The commissioner spoke at a ceremony organised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to celebrate survivors of COVID-19 in the state and to stress the point that COVID-19 is real but not a death sentence. “We’ve had 42 people who have tested positive and been admitted for treatment but they have all been discharged,” the commissioner added. The commissioner who represented the Chairman of the state COVID-19 Containment Committee and Secretary to the State Government, Malam Bashir Ahmed, advised against taking COVID-19 for granted despite the low infection rate in the state. Making a direct reference to the COVID-19 survivors who were represented at the event, the Containment Committee chairman said through the health commissioner, “You have proof that the isolation centre is not a dead end. You have defeated COVID-19. For that, I declare you all as heroes and heroines.” He disclosed that since the COVID-19 index case was confirmed in the state on April 22, the state had tested 374 cases out of which 42 proved positive, with 19 suspected cases pending. A representative of the COVID-19 survivors who spoke at the event urged Nigerians to believe that the disease exists and make deliberate efforts to avoid infection. “I didn’t believe it was real until I suddenly became ill and experienced difficulty in breathing. I called the NCDC and that was the beginning of my journey to the isolation and treatment centre,” the survivor said, thanking the state COVID-19 Containment Committee and health officers for their efforts.

President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday said he was upset over incidents of rape and gender-based violence against women and young girls across the country. Buhari who made this known in his Democracy Day broadcast, reiterated his administration’s determination to fight gender-based violence. He said this will be achieved through the instrumentality of the law and awareness creation, adding that Nigerian women remain a special treasure to this nation. He, therefore, assured that all reported cases of rape, assaults and other sexual offences would be thoroughly investigated and the culprits will be prosecuted accordingly. “It is for this reason that my administration will continue to give them a place of pride in the affairs of the country. “I salute your courage, enterprise and resilience as well as your contributions to national development. “I wish to assure all our women of this administration’s determination to fight Gender-Based Violence through the instrumentality of the law and awareness creation. “I am particularly upset at recent incidents of rape, especially of very young girls. “The Police are pursuing these cases with a view to bringing perpetrators to swift justice,’’ he added.

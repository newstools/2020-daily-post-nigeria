Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairman, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) has reacted to details of Raymond Abass aka Hushpuppi’s arrest. Hushpuppi and his gang allegedly defrauded over 1.9 million victims, using fake email to people and diverting payments to their account. Dubai Police say the suspects are part of a ring that has executed a series of scams totaling up to $435.6 million Dabiri-Erewa, Thursday night on Twitter, stated that the case was damaging to Nigeria. The SSA to President Muhammadu Buhari, however, insisted that fraud does not reflect the citizens. Her tweets read: “Committing crime and still having the audacity to show off”. “Ramoni Igbalode aka Hushpuppi. This is really denting to our image as a people, but like I always say, fraud does not represent who we are as Nigerians. Hardworking . dedicated, committed. “Whether your name is Ramoni Igbalode Or Invictus Obi, Crime is crime. The law must take its full course!! To those countries, another Nigerian arrested, is what they will say.” Dabiri-Erewa added that those who soil Nigeria’s image will be called out and “the millions making us proud” celebrated.

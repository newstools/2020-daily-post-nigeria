Prophet T.B Joshua of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, SCOAN, has thanked the government for announcing reopening of worship centres, but insisted his church will not open for now. The government, through the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 had on Monday announced the reopening of churches, mosques and other religious centres in the country. T.B Joshua said he will not gather his congregation until when he “hears from God” to do so. Joshua, whose church is one of Nigeria’s major tourist attractions, said he received a “revelation” from God about the church’s initial closure. “Viewers, that same God we are waiting to hear from on when to reopen – when things will go back to normal – as usual,” Joshua said in a statement released to his official Facebook page. “God’s time is the best. We are waiting at His feet for that time. We are tarrying for the Holy Spirit’s instruction. Pray without ceasing.” Prophet Joshua said he would continue his usual broadcasts on Emmanuel TV “until we hear from God when to reopen.” He noted that what he does is God’s work, not his, and thank God the government for understanding.

There was pandemonium at the Muslim Hospital, Ede, Osun State, over the weekend, when a suspected COVID-19 patient, Mutiu Olawuyi, who is said to be working with the Osun State Ministry of Health died in the hospital. His younger brother, Ayo Olawuyi, reportedly disagreed with the hospital management on the need to conduct autopsy on the corpse to ascertain his COVID-19 status. A source at the hospital revealed that the deceased died shortly after he was admitted into the hospital, in which the Director of the Hospital, Dr Moshood Akanbi, insisted on conducting autopsy on the corpse. According to Akanbi; “Mr Mutiu Olawuyi was rushed to the emergency unit of our hospital by his brother, Ayo, around 9:19 pm on Friday. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-810989" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200628-WA0040.jpg" alt="" width="1072" height="804" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200628-WA0040.jpg 1072w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200628-WA0040-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200628-WA0040-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1072px) 100vw, 1072px"> “Medical personnel on duty swiftly attended to the patient because he was in a critical condition.

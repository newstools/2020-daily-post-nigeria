The Ogun State Police command has confirmed the arrest of three members of an armed robbery syndicate. Police said the suspect were those who had earlier escaped arrest when operatives of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) stormed their hideout at Adesan area of Mowe. According to the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, the suspects, Saheed Bello, the leader of the gang; and Sadiq Bello, were traced to Academy area of Ibadan, based on intelligence investigation embarked upon by CSP Tijani Mohammed-led SARS operatives, adding that they were promptly apprehended. Their arrest, DAILY POST learnt, led the police to the residence of one Ibrahim Rasheed, who is the gang’s herbalist, at Ile-Ogbo in Osun State. Items recovered from them, according to Oyeyemi, were one locally made single-barrelled pistol and five live cartridges. In a statement on Monday, he informed that the gang had been responsible for series of robbery cases around Mowe/Ofada areas of Ogun State in recent times. DAILY POST recalls that four members of the gang had earlier been arrested on June 7 by the SARS operatives, while the recently arrested ones escaped. But, the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, reportedly launched a serious manhunt for them, leading to their arrest. “Meanwhile, the Ogun State Commissioner of Police has directed a full scale investigation into the past activities of the suspects with a view to charging them to court as soon as investigation is concluded.”

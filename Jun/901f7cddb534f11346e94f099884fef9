President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the sack of the Managing Director, Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading, PLC (NBET), Dr Marilyn Amobi. Buhari had, in January, overruled her sack by Minister of Power, Sale Mamman. On Monday, Mamman’s spokesman, Aaron Artimas, announced Amobi’s removal in a statement. The official said she will be replaced by Dr. Nnaemeka Eweluka, the company’s General Counsel and Secretary. The statement said the appointment was in “furtherance of the reorganisation/realignments in the power sector.” It said Eweluka “Is to succeed Dr. Marilyn Amobi, as substantive Managing Director/CEO, while the former MD is to hand over and proceed on terminal leave with immediate effect.” Eweluka, a lawyer, comes to the position with over 20 years experience, spanning private practice, academics and the power sector. Artimas added that he is “a specialist on privatisation and legal energy reforms as well as a member of the Chartered Institute of Arbitration.”

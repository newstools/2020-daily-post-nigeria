The Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has said he is in support of the All Progressives Congress (APC) decision, to disqualify Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State, from the June 22 primaries. Obaseki will not contest for second term on the platform of the APC, after the party’s screening committee disqualified him, over alleged “defective certificate.” Ganduje, while speaking with reporters on Monday, said what matters at the moment is the legal implications of the likely outcome of the exercise. The Kano Governor cited Bayelsa as an example, claiming the ruling party won the election in the state, but lost to the opposition on point of legality at the court. “As far as Edo is concerned, we are worried about the legality of our action. We believe the national headquarters of our party is doing all it takes to stay in the right course,” Ganduje said. “We are conscious of legal implications, we don’t want to overlook anything that will turn to be our albatross, the issue of Bayelsa state where we won an election and taken away is still fresh in our memory.” Ganduje expressed optimism that no matter what happened, the APC would emerge victorious in the forthcoming gubernatorial election in Edo.

The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has reacted to reports that Atiku Abubakar, former Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, will be running for the same office in 2023. One of Atiku’s sons, Abubakar Adamu had explained that the former Vice President would contest for presidency again in 2023 because “he has been an astute, strategic, master politician for almost four decades.” Adamu, who is the Commissioner for Works and Energy in Adamawa State made the disclosure while presenting his Ministry’s one-year score card. Atiku was defeated during the 2015 presidential election by President Muhammadu Buhari after several attempts. Reacting to the declaration, ACYF President-General, Yerima Shettima said the North had not taken position on backing any candidate, ahead of the next presidential election. Speaking with DAILY POST, Shettima said consultations would be made and the North would come up with a candidate. He said: “There is going to be wide consultations, the North has not taken a position and if you are to be his son, you will also say the same thing that you want your father to be the president. “There is nothing wrong in Atiku’s son saying his father will contest or win election, anybody can say such. “The North has not taken position on Atiku and any candidate for now, there is no consultation to that effect. “We will definitely consult with our kinsmen so that we can agree and take a common position.” On North retaining power in 2023, Shettima said: “The assurance I have is that we run a just society and also we run a democratic government where people will go out en-masse and do the needful by voting.”

Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello, has denied that there is a plot to kick out National Chairman of the party, Ahmed Bola Tinubu. Bello stated this while speaking on Politics Today, a programme aired on Channels Television on Friday. The Governor also denied that there was crisis within the ruling party and described it as “disagreement between members.” He said: “In APC we had no crisis, just a disagreement between members. “Bola Tinubu has paid his dues. And nobody is undermining him. “He continues to play a fatherly role. We need him and he needs us.” Tinubu was not invited to Thursday’s National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting. It was the meeting, that President Muhammadu Buhari dissolved the APC’s National Working Committee (NWC), a move that was widely interpreted as a tactic to sideline Tinubu and the embattled National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole.

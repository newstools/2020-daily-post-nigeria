Manchester United gaffer, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has heaped praises on strikers, Odion Ighalo and Anthony Martial following the Red Devils’ FA Cup quarter-final 2-1 victory against Norwich City on Saturday. Two goals from Ighalo and Harry Maguire ensured Man United qualified for the FA Cup semi-finals for the third time in five seasons. Ighalo netted the first goal at Norwich City and challenged the loose ball that was finished by Maguire for the late win in extra-time, while Martial came on from the bench in extra time. “It is great to have the option to rotate,” Solskjaer told the BBC after the match. “Anthony has done really well. He came on and did brilliant, created chances. But Odion gives me a chance to rest Antho and is a proven goalscorer. “And today he has played a part in both goals and is great to have him around the dressing room.” Man United’s next match is against Brighton in the Premier League on Tuesday.

A commercial motorcyclist and his passenger were on Monday morning crushed to death by a tipper lorry. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. TRACE Corps Spokesperson, Babatunde Akinbiyi, said the accident occurred around 8:10 am around Indomie axis, inbound Idiroko road. The accident, it was learned, involved a white and blue coloured Iveco Tipper, with registration number, XA977JBD and a Honda motorcycle with number plate, LAR935WT. According to Akinbiyi, four men were involved in the accident. He said the Okada rider was inbound Oju-Ore, Ota, from Iyana-Iyesi, around Winners axis, when he suddenly decided to face incoming traffic, by driving in a direction prohibited by traffic law (one way) from Oju-Ore to Idiroko, due to traffic congestion. “In the process of maneuvering in-between vehicles, including a tipper loaded with granite and the motorcycle in front of it, the tipper ran over them and the Okada rider and one of the two passengers he was carrying died on the spot. “The two dead victims’ bodies have been deposited at the morgue of Ifo General Hospital, while the driver of the tipper and the accidented vehicle, as well as the motorcycle, have been taken to the Onipanu Divisional Police Station, Ota,” Akinbiyi informed.

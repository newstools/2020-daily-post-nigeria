The National Human Rights Commission, NHRC, has appealed to the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, to join the commission in the campaign against rape, sexual and gender-based violence against women and the girl-child. The Chief Legal Officer of the commission, Ina Audu, in company of other officers of the commission, disclosed this during a visit to the Kaduna State CAN Chairman, Rev. John Joseph Hayab-led exco on Friday, in Kaduna. Mrs. Audu said they were on five days advocacy visit and street walk on campaign against rapes, sexual and gender-based violence that have escalated during the COVID-19 lockdown. She said even though the commission had been crying out against rapes and sexual abuses, it decided to embark on the advocacy and street walk to many places. According to Mrs. Audu, even though many had being in the fight against the menace, most especially faith-based organizations like church Pastors and Reverend Fathers because of their outreach to people, there was a need to inform them to intensify the campaign. She also reiterated the need for Pastors, lmams and other clergymen to intensify the teachings against rapes and other sexual and gender-based violence in their Churches and Mosques and as well let the people know that it’s wrong and criminal to rape women, girls and even boys. Responding, the Kaduna CAN chairman, Rev. John Joseph Hayab, said the religious leaders have big roles to play and to keep educating their members that rape and other gender violence, in whatever guise, is criminal and evil, whether to a woman, girl-child, and even to boys. Hayab expressed dismay, “lt’s possible that this rape issue has been happening to our children without people even knowing until now when people are forced to stay at home due to COVID-19. Or it’s been wrongly handled by the law enforcement agencies.”

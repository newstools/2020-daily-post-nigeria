A thunderstorm has killed 18 suspected kidnappers at a forest in Adamawa State. Sources said the men of the underworld were sharing ransom money they got from their victims when the thunder struck them. The incident occurred within the Toungo Local Government Area of the state, local sources said. Toungo is a town and local government area in the southern part of Adamawa State on the Nigeria-Cameroon border. “The bandits, it was gathered, had collected over N20 million from their wealthy victims between Koncha in Cameroon and Toungo in Nigeria,” a source in Toungo said. According to the source, the suspected kidnappers met their end because angry victims went spiritual against them. “Angered by incessant attacks by the kidnappers, community leaders and victims consulted a native doctor to send thunder after the bandits. They met their Waterloo when they gathered to share the money,” the source said, adding that local hunters could not retrieve their corpses nor their money inside some bags as well as their weapons. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, said Friday morning that the incident actually happened within Cameroon soil near the border with Nigeria. “We heard that the victims engaged the services of a native doctor, but it was said to have occurred in the neighbouring Cameroon, which is not under our jurisdiction,” Nguroje said.

The Osun State House of Assembly on Wednesday passed into law the bill that recommends life imprisonment for rape perpetrators and 14 years jail term for attempted rape. The Speaker, RT. Hon. Timothy Owoeye, in his submission, asserted that with the passage of the bill will assist to curtail the case of rape that is more rampant in the state. The bill, having passed through thorough evaluation at a public hearing was later considered by Committee of the whole before passing third reading. Owoeye noted that the law would also permit active participation of youth in sanitized government activities in the state. He observed that the bill would charge the law enforcement agents to prosecute rape cases logically and implored the youth to desist from the ugly character. He said “I enjoy the youth to shun act of getting richer overnight.” In their separate remarks, the lawmakers urged youths to desist from ungodly acts against women. They advised the youth to engage in one vocational or the other in other to be self-reliant. These content links are provided by Content.ad.

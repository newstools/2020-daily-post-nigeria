Chelsea returned to action for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Premier League to be put on hold, beating Reading 1-0 in a friendly played on Wednesday afternoon at Cobham. Pedro scored the only goal of the match in the first-half to give Frank Lampard’s men a 1-0 victory against the Championship side. N’Golo Kante, who returned to contact training on Tuesday, was among those who played, as were, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Billy Gilmour, and Christian Pulisic. English Premier League (EPL) clubs have been given the all-clear to play friendlies ahead of the scheduled restart on June 17. Recall that EPL has been on suspension for almost three months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Chelsea, who are fourth in the standings, are away to Aston Villa on June 21.

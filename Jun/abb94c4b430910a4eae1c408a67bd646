Following the announced commencement of an indefinite strike by the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) on Monday, a former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to do everything possible to get the health workers back to the negotiation table immediately amid the COVID-19 pandemic. DAILY POST had earlier reported that following the expiration of its notice, NARD had commenced a nationwide strike. NARD President, Dr. Aliyu Sokomba, had warned that the doctors would embark on an industrial action if the Federal Government failed to meet its demands. In a circular Sunday night, the body ordered its members nationwide to down tools. The decision was consequent upon the 14 days ultimatum “served the government for indefinite strike action, in accordance with the resolution of the Ordinary General Meeting of the Association on May 29.” NARD told all resident doctors, medical officers below the rank of Principal Medical Officer and House Officers across all the Federal and State hospitals in Nigeria, to embark “on a total and indefinite strike”. The strike took effect 12:01 am on Monday, June 15 2020. Reacting, Ezekwesili in a tweet on her official Twitter page on Monday, called for ‘dialogue’. She said: “Oh No! @MBuhari@NGRPresident@NigeriaGov@Fmohnigeria should do EVERYTHING possible to get them back to the negotiation table immediately. “We all know the Doctors and other Health Workers have a strong case as evidenced by our dysfunctional Health System but DIALOGUE, please.”

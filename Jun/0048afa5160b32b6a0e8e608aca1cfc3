Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has pulled out of the reconciliation efforts of the Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. He told newsmen in Port Harcourt today that some members of the National Working Committee NWC of the PDP are sycophants and tax collectors who will never tell the truth. According to him, instead of the NWC to carry everybody along in Edo State, they resorted to using the media to blackmail him. “I told them that in Edo State, we must handle the issue carefully and carry everybody along. They must respect human beings and not behave like tax collectors. “They said because an order was obtained from a Federal High Court in Port Harcourt, then I am responsible. “I have had sleepless nights to resolve the issue in Edo state. The Governors of Edo, Adamawa, and Delta states, know what I have done to resolve the issues in Edo state. “As a result of this senseless accusation, I have pulled out of Edo State settlement. My integrity matters. Governor Wike said he would no longer participate in any reconciliation and wondered why the NWC now wants to consult governors of the party. He questioned why the NWC did not consult with Governors in the case of Bayelsa State. The governor warned that if PDP is not careful, the crisis in the All Progressives Congress (APC) would be a child’s play. “I am brought up not to accept injustice, and that is why I keep speaking out on national issues. Nobody in PDP can intimidate Rivers State. “Nobody can threaten me because I said things must be done constitutionally. I will always continue to satisfy my conscience. “From now on, I want to concentrate on the development of Rivers State,” he added.

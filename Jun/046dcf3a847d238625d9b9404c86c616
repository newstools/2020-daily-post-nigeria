Real Madrid captain, Sergio Ramos has warned La Liga rivals Barcelona that his side is going to do everything possible to win the Spanish top-flight league title this season. Ramos issued the warning after leading Real Madrid to beat Mallorca 2-0 on Wednesday night in the La Liga. The 34-year-old scored a sublime free-kick against Mallorca at the Santiago Bernabeu, to give Zinedine Zidane’s men all three points against the visitors. The victory sees Real Madrid on 68 points after 31 La Liga fixtures just like Barcelona. However, Madrid is ahead of their bitter rivals on head-to-head record. “We know every remaining game is like a final and we’re going to give it everything we have to win LaLiga,” Ramos was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying after the game. “We would love to win it as a reward for this effort we’ve put in following the interruption due to the coronavirus. We’ve had a few very tough weeks of training, and we’re seeing the benefits.” Ramos will now hope to lead Real Madrid to victory when they take on Espanyol on Sunday in their next La Liga fixture.

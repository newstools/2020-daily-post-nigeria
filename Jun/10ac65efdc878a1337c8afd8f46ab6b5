The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti State has vowed to end the current rift among stakeholders in the party and take over the state in 2022. The party, through the Caretaker Committee headed by Senator Hosea Agboola, also assured all members of fairness and pursuit of peace as the mission of the current leadership is to bring both old and new members together again. Following the expiration of the tenure of Barrister Gboyega Oguntuase-led executive of the party in Ekiti and inability to conduct state Congress, the Prince Uche Secondus-led National Working set up the caretaker Committee to preside over the party in the state. Speaking with journalists in Ado-Ekiti Yesterday, Agboola and the Secretary of the committee, Diran Odeyemi, said the mission at present is to bring the party back to its 2002 form so as to form a formidable force against the present government. According to Agboola, there was no iota of truth in the rumour that the caretaker committee was favouring a faction loyal to former Governor Ayodele Fayose. He said the party would work hard in the pursuit of its peace mission to bring back former Minister of Works, Senator Adedayo Adeyeye as the return of former Governor Segun Oni is already a big boost. “The fact that former Governor Segun Oni has just rejoined the PDP is the greatest achievement of this committee. “We are going to reach out to former Minister of Works, Dayo Adeyeye and others who left before the July 14, 2018 governorship election and bring them back to the party. “This committee was set up without bias. We have visited Governor Fayose, Senators Olujimi and Duro Faseyi and what all of them were pushing for are peace and unity, nothing more. “The party belongs to all the party members, not anyone from ward to the national level. Whoever wants to come is welcome. PDP is a brand. It remains the only party where you can contest without belonging to any clique or godfather,” Agboola stated.

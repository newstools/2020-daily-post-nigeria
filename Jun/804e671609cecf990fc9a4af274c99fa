Barcelona midfielder, Ivan Rakitic, has ruled out the possibility of leaving the club this summer’s transfer window amid interest from Premier League giants, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur. Rakitic, whose current contract at Barcelona will expire in 2021, has been linked with a move to Manchester United, Tottenham, Juventus, Sevilla and Atletico Madrid in the past. The Croatian international has not been regular for the La Liga champions so far this season due to competitions from Frenkie De Jong and Arthur. The 32-year-old, who joined Barcelona from Sevilla in 2014, was among the eight players the Catalan club want to sell this summer. But Rakitic has now insisted that he has no intention of leaving Barcelona in the next transfer window. “I spoke to the club ten or fifteen days ago, and the conclusion is that I have nothing to talk about because I have a contract with Barcelona until the summer of 2021 and it is the entity I want to be in and play with,” Rakitic told Croatian publication, Tportal. “Furthermore, my wife and my daughters are good in the city. “There is no reason to think about other things. I am training well, and I am sure that Rakitic will be in Barcelona longer.”

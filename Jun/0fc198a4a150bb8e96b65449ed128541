Mallam Aminu Ado, a 58-year-old man, has been arrested by men of the Nigeria police for allegedly impersonating the widow of Abba Kyari, late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari. Ado, according to the police, has been duping unsuspecting Nigerians through the act. The man also known as Al Amin Yerima, was paraded by the Force Public Relations Officer, DCP Frank Mba, in Abuja on Monday. The Force PRO told journalists that after the death of the former chief of staff, Ado went on to impersonate the widow and reached out to prominent Nigerians asking for donations to enable him organize special prayers for her husband. “In the course of doing that some of the prominent Nigerians became suspicious and reached out to us. He has been cooperative with the investigation and held back no facts. “He is 58 years old. He had also had a stint with EFCC in 2019. He was charged to an Abuja High Court and was convicted and imprisoned for three months as a result of the plea bargain he successfully initiated by his lawyers,” Mba said He said that Ado installed an app on his phone capable of changing his voice to that of a woman to which he used to perpetuate the criminal act. Mba explained that Ado admitted doing it without the consent of any member of Kyari’s family. Ado was quoted to have also admitted contacting the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, House of Representatives Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila and the Governor of Plateau State, Simon Lalong to collect money. The suspect said he knew the politicians very well as he was also a politician and they have been talking. “I am a politician and I have the ambition of being governor of Kano State 2023 insha allah,” he confidently said.

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has blamed the injuries his side suffered during their 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday, for disrupting his game plan. Arteta was forced to replace Granit Xhaka and Pablo Mari in the first half, as the Gunners were outclassed at the Etihad. Mari’s replacement, David Luiz, gifted City two goals either side of half time before he was sent off. “Everything went wrong from the first minute when Granit [Xhaka] got injured and we had to change the plan a little bit. “But every possible accident that could’ve happened hopefully happened today and not in the rest of the 10 games we have ahead of us,” Arteta told Sky Sports. Arsenal travel to Brighton on Saturday.

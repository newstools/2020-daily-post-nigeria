The Benin Zonal Office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Tuesday, arraigned Alabi Azeez Babatunde and Elizabeth Farotimi for alleged N10 million fraud. The duo were made to appear before Justice Demi-Ajayi of the Federal High Court, Benin, Edo State. DAILY POST learnt that the suspects were alleged to have sometime in 2018 defrauded Alkairu Sani of the sum of N10,085,000, by claiming to have supernatural powers and ability to multiply any amount of money. EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale disclosed this through a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja. One of the charges read: “That you, Alabi Azeez Babatunde, Elizabeth Farotimi and Ogungbemi Taiwo (at large) on and about the month of August 2018 in Benin, Edo State, within the jurisdiction of the Federal High Court of Nigeria did with intent to defraud, induced one Alkairu Sani to pay the aggregate sum of N9,225,000 (Nine Million, Two Hundred and Twenty -Five Thousand Naira) Only into account No: 0041475970, domiciled in Union Bank PLC and operated by you, by representing yourselves as possessing the power of increasing and doubling the said amount through sacrifices and invocation of juju, contrary to Section 2( b) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act 2006 and punishable under Section 2(c) of the same Act”. But the defendants pleaded not guilty of all the charges, prompting prosecution counsel, I.M. Elody to pray the court to fix a trial date and to remand them in the custody of Nigerian Correctional Service, Benin City. However, the defence counsel, Emmanuel Okorie prayed the court for a short date of adjournment to enable him file the defendants’ bail applications. In his ruling, Justice Demi-Ajayi ordered that the defendants be remanded in the Nigerian Correctional facility, Oko Central, Benin City and adjourned hearing on the bail to July 1.

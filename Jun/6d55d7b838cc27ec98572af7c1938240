Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has reportedly decided to battle Premier League rival, Chelsea for Leicester City defender, Ben Chilwell, according to the UK Telegraph. Guardiola has his heart set on the left-back and wants Man City to sign him this summer’s transfer window. Chilwell could be Guardiola’s first signing this summer as he prepares to bolster his team for next season. Leicester City is expected to demand close to £85million for Chilwell as they sold their former defender, Harry Maguire to Manchester United last summer. DAILY POST recalls that Chilwell has been heavily linked with a move to Chelsea this summer. Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, is keen to add the 23-year-old to his squad as Marcos Alonso’s replacement at Stamford Bridge.

Lille manager, Christophe Galtier, has admitted that he expects to lose striker Victor Osimhen and centre-back Gabriel this summer. The Ligue 1 side narrowly missed out on clinching a Champions League spot for next season, which means they are likely to sanction sales to raise cash. Osimhen and Gabriel are two of the squad members that have attracted a lot of attention from European clubs. The Nigerian has been linked with Premier League heavyweights and Napoli, while Gabriel has been associated with Everton. “I can confirm that both Gabriel and Victor are likely to depart. I’ve expected it for a long time. “They are working very seriously and we’re working currently with the players who are currently here who are likely to replace them and obviously on future players who will come to us to replace them in their posts,” Galtier said according to Goal.

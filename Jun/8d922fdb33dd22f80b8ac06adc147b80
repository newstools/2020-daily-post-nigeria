A rights group, Nigeria Arise Against Crime (NAAC), has written President Muhammadu Buhari, asking him to without further delay, sack the current Service Chiefs. NAAC said that dismissing these security chiefs would rescue Nigeria and the current government from the embarrassment of losing several lives to insurgents and bandits on a daily basis. Yusuf Kazeem, the National Coordinator of the group, made the call at a press conference in Abuja on Thursday. The group insisted that sustaining the security chiefs who have exhausted their wit is a disservice to the nation’s security architecture. The group vowed to stage a nationwide protest against the government to bring to the attention of the world gimmicks being played by the military top hierarchy to cover up for their deficiencies. “We will in the coming days mobilise for protests in all the states of the federation including the Federal Capital Territory to ensure that the President brings in persons with fresh ideas and energy to further prosecute the war against insecurity,” the group noted. The group said that facts available to it show that the Service Chiefs have exhausted their wit. It noted that nothing new from the security chiefs is being done to add vigour to the fight against insurgents, bandits and other criminal elements across the country.

The Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) says it will hold its 11th teleconference on Wednesday to review the grievances of the Nigeria Association of Resident Doctors (NARD). This was contained in a statement issued by Mr. Abdulrazaque Bello-Barkindo, the Head, Media and Public Affairs of the forum, in Abuja on Monday. Bello-Barkindo said the review had become necessary after brokering the suspension of industrial action by NARD, in order to ensure that doctors returned to work and provide services under a convivial working atmosphere. DAILY POST recalls that NARD had, on Sunday, announced the suspension of its two weeks industrial action, after a meeting initiated by the leadership of the NGF with the executives of the association. Bello-Barkindo said that the meeting, expected to be joined by all the 36 governors at 2 pm., had other critical issues listed on its agenda. “According to the invitation issued by the Director-General of the forum, Mr Asishana Okauru on Monday, several crucial national issues will be addressed by the governors, prominent among which are health, economy and infrastructure. “Also expected to feature at the NGF meeting is a presentation on the update of the COVID-19 strategic plan by the Health Minister, Dr Osagie Ohanire. “Another update on the NGF’s committee of governors mandated by the forum to interface with the Presidential Task Force on the COVID-19 pandemic, headed by Dr Ifeanyi Okowa, Governor of Delta State, will also be brought before the forum for review. “Recall that governors have been in the forefront of the struggle to get Nigeria off the global polio map, which finally materialised a couple of weeks ago. “The report will be placed before them at the meeting to accord them the chance to adopt new strategies of maintaining the polio-free status of the country,” he said.

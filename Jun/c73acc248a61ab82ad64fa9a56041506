Igbo Youth Congress (IYC) has called for the rearrest of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP)’s spokesman, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, saying that his arrest would save the nation of imminent crises. The group said that the call has become necessary in view of the allegation of $10 million bribe Ugochinyere alleged was given to the Speaker of Nigeria’s House of Representatives, Hon,. Femi Gbajabiamila. In a statement issued and made available to DAILY POST in Abuja on Thursday, by the IYC’s National President, Dr Stephen Nwafor, the group wondered how CUPP’s spokesman was unable to prove claims that Bill Gates Foundation offered $10 million bribe to facilitate the passage of Infectious Disease Control Bill. Dr. Nwafor said, CUPP’s spokesman was out to service the surreptitious motive of some political elements in the country, adding that the allegation was not only weighty, but dangerous. The group further noted that the Igbo people of South East Nigeria distaste falsehood of this magnitude, stressing that the solution to the looming problem was for the IGP to re-arrest and prosecute him. “What Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere is doing is obvious that he has been hired by some political elements to do the hatchet job. “We are deeply worried that a man with no certificate, no verifiable address and known for evil projects would choose to ridicule the entire Igbos especially the Igbo lawmakers in the National Assembly by leveling such unfounded allegation. “Let him tell the world when he graduated from the University and the year of his NYSC. Because of his gullibility, he has allowed himself to be used by desperate politicians to mock the country at it’s trying moment”, the statement said. The group further allayed fears that the image of Ndi Igbo would be dragged in the mud, if activities of Ugochinyere was allowed unchecked.

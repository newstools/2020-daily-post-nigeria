Eight Premier League clubs have crossed UEFA’s Financial Fair Play threshold, the UK Mirror reports. This is contained in the Annual Review of Football Finance published by Deloitte, examining clubs’ expenditure and revenue. The review from the 2018/2019 season, showed that eight top-flight clubs are above the 70% warning threshold stipulated by UEFA. Among them are Bournemouth, Everton and Leicester, who reported salaries to revenue ratios of 85%, 85% and 83% respectively. It is the first time since the 2015/2016 campaign there is more than one Premier League club with a ratio of more than 80%. Chelsea, West Ham, Crystal Palace, Southampton and Fulham (who have since been relegated) were the other clubs to report figures above 70%.

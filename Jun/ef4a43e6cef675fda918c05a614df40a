The International Criminal Court (ICC) has condemned the United States’ imposition of financial and travel sanctions on court officials. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions against persons investigating American troops for potential war crimes in Afghanistan. ICC, in a statement, expressed “profound regret at the announcement of further threats and coercive actions, including financial measures, against the court and its officials.” The UN-backed institution said the “attacks constitute an escalation and an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law and the court’s judicial proceedings.” ICC had announced that it would probe possible crimes against humanity in Afghanistan between 2003 and 2014, including those allegedly committed by U.S. forces and the CIA. The U.S. order includes visa restrictions against those affected and their families. “We will not stand by as our people are threatened by a kangaroo court,” Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo said. America warned that it would take tougher measures if the enquiry was carried out.

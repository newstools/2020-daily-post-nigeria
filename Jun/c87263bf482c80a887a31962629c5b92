Ogenyi Onazi has denied he ever had any problem with the former Super Eagles captain, John Mikel Obi. There were rumours that Onazi and Mikel had heated arguments before the 2018 World Cup in Russia. It is claimed that both midfielders stopped talking and their relationship completely collapsed by the time the Nigerian national team arrived for the competition two years ago. However, in an interview with Brila FM, Onazi insists there is mutual respect between him and Mikel Obi. “First of all, I can’t have a misunderstanding with John Obi Mikel, because he’s like a mentor to me. “It was a privilege for me to play with him in the national team,” he said.

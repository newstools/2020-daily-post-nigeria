Justice A. J. Awak of Gombe State High Court, on Wednesday, convicted an operative of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Zubairu Baba Ali. The officer attached to the Yobe State Command was sentenced to three years imprisonment for employment scam. He was arraigned before the court by the Gombe Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC). The one-count charge bordered on cheating to the tune of N300,000. The offense was contrary to Section 320 and punishable under Section 322 of the Penal Code Law of Northern Nigeria. Ali had in 2017, collected the money from one Muhammed Bashir Muhammad in Gombe, to secure a job at NSCDC. Bashir paid the money into a third-party accountâ€™s number. EFCC said the owner of the account with Keystone Bank, Iliyasu Yakubu Amana, admitted that he handed over the money to the convict. When arraigned, Ali pleaded guilty to the charge. Prosecution counsel, G. I. Ndeh, prayed the court to convict him accordingly. In his ruling, however, Justice Awak gave the convict an option of N50,000 fine.

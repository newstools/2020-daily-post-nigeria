Former four times boxing world champion, Roberto Duran, has been hospitalized after contracting the deadly Coronavirus disease. His son, Robin Duran disclosed this via his Instagram account on Friday saying that his father was taken to hospital after experiencing cold-like symptoms. Robin said they thought he had cold due to the fact that “he has a lung that doesn’t work 100 percent due to an accident he had in Argentina a few years ago”. According to him, the 69-year-old Panamanian boxing legend was being diagnosed with COVID-19 after a test was carried out. “My dad’s tests have just arrived and confirmed that he is positive for COVID-19. “Thank God that for now, he has no symptoms other than those of a cold. “He is not in intensive care or on a ventilator, he is still under observation. “We just talked to the doctor and he tells us that the lungs are fine and there is no indication of seriousness. “Let’s continue to have faith that everything will turn out well,” he said. Duran, who retired in 2001 with a professional record of 103-16, was best known for his “Hands of Stone” and his June 1980 victory over Sugar Ray Leonard that earned him the WBC Welterweight title. However, he was inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 2006 and was enshrined in the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 2007.

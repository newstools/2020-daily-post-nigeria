Ahead of the governorship election in Ondo State, the senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has advised governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to reserve his energy on something else and forget about his second term ambition. The cleric specifically said the Spirit of God no longer lives in Alagbaka government house. Addressing some journalists in Akure on Saturday, Giwa said governor Akeredolu had acted contrary to God’s will. He said,” Alagbaka government house is now being surrounded by darkness. The Spirit of God left Alagbaka House the day governor Akeredolu intentionally increased tuition fees from N25,000 to N150,000. “I don’t know who advised him to do so, but whoever asked him to implement such inhuman idea has led him astray. “You can’t claim to love people and at the same time inflicting pain on them. What kind of love is that? “I learnt the governor is running around and dashing out money to some religious leaders and politicians. It’s too late to do so, nobody can save him because those parents who cannot afford N150,000 for tuition fees are angry. “These parents have cried in pain to God to send Akeredolu’s government packing. I advise the governor to stop wasting the resources of Ondo State on ‘paperweight politicians’ who cannot win their wards or polling units. “The only person in the state that governor Akeredolu depends on is former governor, Olusegun Mimiko. Can he help him when the majority of Ondo people have already made up their minds? “Any governor that fails to walk on the paths of PA Adekunle Ajasin and Baba Adebayo Adefarati is not worthy to be re-elected. “If you rig yourself in, God will rig you out. Nobody can play God, and this nonsense must stop.”

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said he is more focused on finishing in third place, rather than helping Liverpool win the title. The Blues welcome champions Manchester City on Thursday night. If Liverpool beat Crystal Palace today, City will need to win at Stamford Bridge to keep the title race alive for another week at least. Lampard’s men need the points themselves, to cement their place in the top four. “I have had absolutely no thought of Liverpool’s situation, it makes no odds to us at all. “We respect Liverpool and Manchester City as two fantastic teams, in the last two to three seasons they’ve been dominant, but we can only look at what this match means for us,” Lampard told a Zoom press conference today.

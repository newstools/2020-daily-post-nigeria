The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Uche Secondus, on Monday, berated President Muhammadu Buhari of not taking charge of the critical sector of the country. Secondus, who stated that the country has been sliding under Buhari stressed that the president had shown no commitment towards rescuing the drifting economy and the security situation of the country. Secondus stated this in Akure, the Ondo State capital, while receiving the Deputy Governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi into the PDP fold. Recall that Ajayi had on Sunday dumped APC for PDP after the relationship between him and his boss, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu turned awry. According to the PDP National Chairman, President Buhari should show more interest in the economy of and as well concentrate on the security of lives and property rather that playing politics of APC. Meanwhile, Secondus who lauded Ajayi for his courageous move assured him of equal rights within the PDP. Secondus also blasted the Ondo State Commissioner of Police over the confrontation he had with the Deputy Governor.

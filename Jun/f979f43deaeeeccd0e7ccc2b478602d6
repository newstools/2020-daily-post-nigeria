Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard has warned the Blues that they need to be ready ahead of their next two Premier League fixtures against Aston Villa and Manchester City respectively. Chelsea will take on Aston Villa in an away Premier League fixture on June 21 and host Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City four days later (June 25) at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea currently sits in the fourth position on the Premier League table with 48 points from 29 games. The Premier League will resume on June 17 after almost three months of suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lampard believes Chelsea will face a difficult start, adding that Aston Villa is fighting for their lives, while Man City has huge qualities. “Every game now in the nine Premier League is going to have something on it for different reasons,” Lampard told Chelsea’s official website. “The first two games are good examples of that. Villa is fighting for their lives, and City has a huge quality, we know that. “It’s a difficult start, and we will need to be ready.”

The Premier League has given clubs permission to play friendly matches ahead of the planned resumption of the season, according to Sky Sports. However, the venues must be no more than 90 minutes away and players must travel in their own cars. Club coaching staff will officiate the matches, as PGMOL referees and assistants are yet to be tested for COVID-19. If played at a stadium, players will enter via the playersâ€™ entrance and walk straight onto the pitch, before warming up. Dressing rooms will not be used. Top-flight clubs were given the go-ahead to resume contract training last week, paving the way for competitive action to resume June 17.

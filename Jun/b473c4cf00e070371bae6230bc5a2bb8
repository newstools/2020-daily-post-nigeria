Former Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has revealed the only way Manchester United can finish in fourth place ahead of Chelsea this season. According to Owen, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side must have a positive mindset and win their first game against Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur on June 19, if they want to secure the Champions League spot for next season ahead of Frank Lampard’s men. Chelsea currently has three points ahead of Man United on the Premier League table. The Premier League will resume on June 17 following almost three months of suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Man United had all the momentum. I do not think they necessarily need to do too much, continue as they were,” Owen told Premier League Productions. “Will Manchester United secure a top-four finish in the Premier League? Yes No ‘You have got a positive mindset and, if they can win their first game, it will all come flooding back. It is vital for them. “Their run of fixtures is okay as well, and they are going to put some pressure on Chelsea for that fourth place. I think they could do it, and they have got momentum. “Fernandes is a brilliant signing and is looking good, Pogba’s coming back, Rashford’s coming back so even though you could say you are breaking their momentum with this [break], two of their best players are going to be fit or very close to fitness when we come back as well.”

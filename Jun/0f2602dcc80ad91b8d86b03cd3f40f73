The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, have asked the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the Nigeria Police Force, NPF, to stop fighting a lost battle. PDP said the Nigeria Police can not stop the mass defection from the APC into its fold. The party made the remark while condemning what it described as an attack on the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi by the state Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami. Recall that Ajayi had dumped the APC for PDP after he was reported to have been prevented from leaving the state’s Government House. However, a statement by PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan reads: “APC and the Nigeria Police Force should stop fighting a lost battle, as nothing can stop the imminent mass defection from the fizzling APC to the PDP across the country. “Saturday’s despicable attack on Ondo Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, by the APC, using the Ondo State Commissioner of @PoliceNG, Bolaji Salami, has further spurred Nigerians in their irrevocable determination to abandon the sinking APC and move to the PDP. “The thoughtless and rude attempt to use the Police to stop the Ondo Deputy Governor from leaving the disorganized APC is symptomatic of the last kicks of a degraded and derelict political party that is now clutching at straws and can only resort to the use of compromised security agents as a face-saving measure. “The APC is unnerved because Nigerians are no longer ready to stomach the deception and lies of 2015 as well as the impunity, political brigandage and the electoral fraud of 2019. “This is because the situation in the country in the last five years have left no one in doubt that the APC is an ill wind; a soulless mob; a decrepit ship of insatiate pirates, political vampires and ravenous power mongers, who thrive in lies, deception and treasury looting; and whose only legacies are economic ruins, an institution of poverty, escalated insecurity, confusion, divisiveness, humongous corruption, dissipated reserves and accumulated debts.”

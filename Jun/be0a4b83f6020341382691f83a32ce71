Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has criticised Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, for describing Nigerian pastors as evil. Kanu had described pastors as demonic for failing to speak out against inequality. The IPOB leader had called on pastors to de-emphasize the collection of tithes and offerings. Reacting, Omokri insisted that Kanu’s remark was faulty. In a post on his Facebook, the former presidential aide said he pastored a church for years during which he assisted members. He wrote: “Dear Nnamdi Kanu, “I pastored a church in Nigeria for 4 years. I never collected salary. I assisted members and tithes and offering was not mandatory. My focus was evangelism and character development. “Your statement that every pastor in Nigeria is evil is faulty. It is even sadder still, became myself and other pastors clamoured for your release when you were in prison. I may not be perfect, but I am not evil and there are hundreds of pastors in Nigeria that are even better than I.”

Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, is reportedly ready to sell four (4) players, to help fund a summer rebuild, according to The Times. The players are Kyle Walker-Peters, Danny Rose, Eric Dier, and Serge Aurier. Tottenham is keen to fund a move for £35 million Southampton midfielder, Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg this summer’s transfer window. Mourinho is eager to bolster his midfield this summer following the departure of Christian Eriksen to Inter Milan last January. However, Walker-Peters is currently on loan at Southampton. Rose is also on loan at Newcastle United, while Dier and Aurier are not on loans. Tottenham will host Manchester United on June 19 in the Premier League after almost three months of suspending the English top-flight league due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

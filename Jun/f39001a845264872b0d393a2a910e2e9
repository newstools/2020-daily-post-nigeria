Popular Nigerian music star, Peter Okoye, has disclosed that his family tested positive for COVID-19. Okoye, who was a member of the defunct Psquare disclosed that he, his wife; Lola and daughter, Aliona tested positive for COVID-19. He made the disclosure on his Twitter page while advising Nigerians that the virus was real. The singer, however, disclosed that they have all tested negative, following proper treatment. Okoye said his family and two domestic staff were infected for three weeks. He urged Nigerians to adhere to the guideline issued by the government to curb the spread of the virus. He said:” I had COVID-19 for about three weeks and it happened to me. I was sick and I tested positive. ” It’s been hell for this family in this house. Not just me. Even two of my domestic staff. “After a week, my daughter caught the virus as well. It was sad that when she caught it, the doctor insisted that she had to be self-isolated in her own room but my wife did something very courageous. She said no. “Five or six days later, my daughter was pronounced negative. When she was pronounced negative, we knew it wasn’t going to end there. The next day, Lola became positive. It has been hell but we had a bad experience. ” I just want to tell everybody that this COVID19 is real. Don’t take it for granted. ” I am happy to announce that my wife, myself, our daughter and two of our domestic staff, all of us are now negative.” Meanwhile, Nigeria’s COVID-19 toll stands at 23,298 cases. This followed the confirmation of 684 new cases as of Friday night by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC.

Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford, has congratulated Odion Ighalo on extending his stay at the club. The Premier League side and Shanghai Shenhua have reached an agreement that will see Ighalo remain at Old Trafford until January 2021. The 30-year-old has been allowed to remain with United, amid uncertainty over the resumption of the Chinese Super League and when foreign players can return. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brought in Ighalo in the January window, after Rashford suffered a back injury. However, the England forward is fit again and will be ready to lead the attack for United, when the season restarts. Rashford retweeted United’s official announcement on Ighalo’s loan extension and commented, “Congrats @ighalojude”. Ighalo replied: “Thanks bro”.

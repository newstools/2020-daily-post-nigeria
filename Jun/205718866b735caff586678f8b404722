Anambra State Indigenes have expressed excitement over Nigeria Carrier, Air Peace’s recent historic trip to China, saying that the opening of a direct route by the airline will boost businesses in the state. A statement by Chief Alex Onukwe, National President of the Association of Anambra Town Unions (ASATU), an umbrella body of town unions in the state, described the airline as one established to boost the country’s image. The statement stated, “Just two days ago, Air Peace flew 312 Indian nationals on its B777 aircraft direct from Murtala Mohammed International Airport in Lagos to Kochi in India nonstop for 10 hours, an event which New Delhi celebrated for its historical value as the first direct flight between Nigeria and India. “Three days earlier, the carrier had lifted 301 Chinese from Lagos to Guangzhou in a direct deal with the Chinese government, the second in as many months”. Onukwe recalled that the airline had earlier flown Israeli citizens from Nigeria to Tel Aviv in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. He noted that Anambra people are happy over the opening of a direct flight to China, as that it will boost businesses in the state. He noted that what was more heartwarming was that in all the routes the airline flies, it takes the Nigerian flag with it, doing the country proud all across the world.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has revealed that his conversations with Timo Werner, convinced the striker to join the club ahead of Liverpool. The 24-year-old was consistently linked with a move to Anfield, but the Blues agreed a £47.5 million ($59m) deal with RB Leipzig for the player. Werner will sign a £170,000-a-week contract with the west Londoners. It is believed that one of the reasons Liverpool ended their interest in the German, was due to the financial issues caused by COVID-19. “He’s got huge talent, had a fantastic season this year but before that as well. Where we probably couldn’t do as much business in the last couple of windows for whatever reasons, it’s given us a chance to see some youth have more time in the team. “But we were very clear about the fact we wanted to improve and Timo Werner is always a signing that will improve us. I’m certainly very excited to have him playing for Chelsea and we look forward to having him,” Lampard told a Zoom press conference on Friday.

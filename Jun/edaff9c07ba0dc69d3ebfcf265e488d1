Following the recent spike in the cases of COVID-19 in Ondo State, the state government on Friday, threatened to order another round of lockdown across the state. While stating that the state might be forced to lock down if the people continue to ignore the measures put in place to contain the spread of the deadly disease, the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, on Special duties and Strategies, Doyin Odebowale, said that social distancing was not effectively observed during Jumaat service monitored in the state. With four deaths already recorded in the state and 11 new cases discovered in the last three days, Odebowale maintained the state will not take chances if the cases continue to rise. He further disclosed that 160 persons who might have come in contact with last confirmed COVID-19 cases in the state are currently being searched for. Odebowale said the state government was not happy with the situation. Recall that on May 27, 2020, the Governor of Ondo State, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu had eased the partial lockdown in the state when he ordered the resumption of religious activities in the state. As regards the situation in mosques, he said that the COVID-19 Committee would meet with Muslim leaders in the state to sensitize them more on the need to observe COVID-19 protocols. “We have been engaging the leadership and we hoped there will be an engagement. We expect them to improve on. There was not much so distancing and we are not satisfied. “We will get in touch with the leadership. We are getting more cases and we are not happy. We don’t want a situation where the government locks down the state again. If it continues, the government will lock down the state.” State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro, said the compliance level was about 60 percent. Dr. Adegbenro urged individuals to help stop the spread of COVID-19.

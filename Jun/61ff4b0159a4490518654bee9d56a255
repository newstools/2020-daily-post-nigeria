Less than 48 hours after they suspended the senator representing Bauchi North senatorial district of Bauchi State in the Senate, Adamu Muhammad Bulkachuwa, from the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the ward level, leaders of the Kafin Kuka /Tsakuwa/Kofar Gabas have made a U-turn on the decision by withdrawing the suspension. The party at the ward level on Tuesday announced the suspension of Senator Bulkachuwa from the party. They alleged that the senator had been absent from his constituency since his inauguration as a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, adding that he neither visited the district since the outbreak of COVID-19 nor provided any palliatives for his constituents, hence he shouldn’t be regarded as a party man. But in a press release signed by the APC ward Chairman, Sa’adu Mohammed, and made available to DAILY POST, the party leaders stated that the purported suspension was done in error and has been withdrawn. Mohammed apologized for the purported suspension, adding that he was notified by the party that what was done at the ward level was wrong and against the APC constitution. “I, Sa’adu Mohammed, ward Chairman of Kafin Kuka /Tsakuwa/Kofar Gabas hereby apologize on what happened on 9/6/2020 at a meeting with some of my executives. I was called by the mother union that what we did was wrong and out of the constitution of APC; that I cannot take decisions on my own. I hereby apologize and that Sen Adamu Muhammad Bulkachuwa remains a valid member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kafin Kuka /Tsakuwa/Kofar Gabas ward. I seek your apologies,” the release stated. The appendix to the release was signed by 20 members of the executive council to signify that it was a collective decision. They, therefore, urged all those offended by the previous action to allow peace to reign within the party in the area and the state as a whole.

The Aare Musulumi of Yoruba land, Edo and Delta States, Alhaji Daud Makanjuola Akinola, on Sunday, charged the new Commissioner of Police in Oyo State, Mr. Joe Nwachukwu Enwonwu, not to allow another killing of innocent citizens occur, before the killers of those who have been killed recently are arrested. Akinola gave this charge when he led the Aare Musulumi in council to pay condolence visits to the families of Barakat Bello, a 18-year old teenager who was killed by some unknown gunmen and Grace Oshiagwu, a 21-year old lady who was killed yesterday. DAILY POST gathered that no fewer than three ladies have been killed by yet-to-be-identified persons suspected to be rapists-cum-ritualists in the last two weeks in Akinyele Local Government Area of Oyo State. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803469" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170519.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170519.jpg 2560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170519-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170519-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170519-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170519-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"> Grace Oshiagwu was allegedly raped and murdered at Idi-Ori, Sasa-Ojoo in Akinyele Local Government Area on Saturday. Our correspondent recalls that the incident is coming barely two weeks after the death of Barakat Bello, who was recently raped and murdered in Ibadan. Azeezat Shomuyiwa, another lady was also murdered by unknown assailants in the same local government area of the state. DAILY POST, however, learnt that killers of the three victims are yet to be arrested or named. But, Akinola while reacting, urged the Police Commissioner not to allow further killings occur in the state, before the perpetrators of the previous crimes are arrested. Akinola, who noted that residents of the state and the entire South West part of the country are currently in fear due to the recent killings, also charged Oyo state government under Engineer Seyi Makinde not to toy with security issues. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-803468" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170934.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170934.jpg 2560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170934-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170934-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170934-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_20200614_170934-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"> He said, “We are concerned citizens of Oyo State, what is going on now is a big concern to all of us. These are young girls. We are just coming from the residence of these young girls who have been killed. They were raped and killed. Before, what we are hearing is kidnapping, what oz going on now is that nobody is feeling safe now. “Those people are not coming for material things. They raped and killed them. We are appealing to the government to make our environment safe for the masses. We went to these places and for the same thing. We are appealing to the state government to put more efforts on security matter. “I want to charge the new Commissioner of Police to look very carefully at this security matter. He is new in the state, he should look carefully at these incidents. We don’t want our girls to be raped and killed anymore. We should not allow another one to occur before they arrest the killers of these young girls. “The neighbours too should also help themselves, we should be having joint security meetings because government cannot do it alone. “Government cannot do everything, we also need to help ourselves. But, I am still appealing to the Oyo State government to help us do more on security matter in the state.”

The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has moved the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) to 2022, due to the COVID-19 outbreak. CAFâ€™s Executive Committee confirmed the decision on Tuesday after a meeting. The tournament was scheduled to begin on January 9, 2021, in Cameroon, but will now be played from January 2022. It is understood that CAF feels there might not be enough for the qualifiers to be concluded in time for the AFCON. CAF also confirmed the 2020 African Nations Championship for home-based players will be played next year, having originally been scheduled for April 2020. Africa had reported more than 397,000 COVID-19 infections and over 9,900 deaths as of Tuesday afternoon, according to data from worldometer.

Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has expressed sadness over the demise of his predecessor, Abiola Ajimobi. The governor, in a condolence message to the Ajimobi family and the people of Oyo, directed that the state’s flag fly at half mast on Friday. Makinde said he could imagine the pain the family must be going through because of the loss of their patriarch. “It is my prayer that God grants them all the strength to bear this great loss. I join the good people of Oyo State as we mourn the death of a statesman. I have directed that flags fly at half-mast tomorrow.” Makinde said Ajimobi will be remembered for leaving a blueprint for some of the activities that his administration is undertaking. “The Oyo State Government will be extending to his family, all the courtesies deserving of his personage. May his soul rest in peace”, he added.

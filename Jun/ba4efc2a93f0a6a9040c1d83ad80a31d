The UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres has commiserated with the government and people of Burundi over the death of President Pierre Nkurunziza. Guterres, in a statement released on Tuesday, extended his sympathy to the former president’s family. ”The UN remains willing to supporting Burundi in defeating the coronavirus pandemic, and in its continuing efforts to create a stable, prosperous, and peaceful future for all the country’s citizens,” he said. NAN reports that the government said there would be a period of national mourning for seven days from Tuesday and that flags would be flown at half-mast. Recall that Nkurunziza’s death was confirmed by the country’s government on its official Twitter page. A statement by the authority said the President had attended a volleyball match on Saturday afternoon and was taken to the hospital that evening after falling ill. He then suffered a heart attack and died at a hospital in Karuzi, eastern Burundi.

One of the police officers charged for George Floyd’s death, Thomas Lane, has been freed. Lane was one of the four officers arrested and charged for aiding and abetting second degree murder and manslaughter. He posted bail of $750,000 and was released on Wednesday from the Hennepin County Jail, with conditions. The other three officers remain in custody. The 37-year-old got into trouble following his role in the arrest of Floyd, who was murdered by another officer, Derek Chauvin. Lane’s counsel, last week said his client was a rookie, adding that the only thing he (Lane) did was hold Floyd’s feet so he could not kick. The criminal complaint also said that Lane expressed concern about Floyd and asked Chauvin twice if they should roll Floyd to his side, but Chauvin said no until the black American died.

Juventus defender, Leonardo Bonucci, has reacted to forward, Cristiano Ronaldo’s penalty miss against AC Milan in the Coppa Italia second leg semi-final 0-0 draw on Friday. Recall that both Juventus and AC Milan played a 1-1 draw in the first leg at the San Siro Stadium in February. However, in the return leg at an empty Allianz Stadium on Friday night, Ronaldo missed from the spot-kick seconds before Ante Rebic was sent off. The 35-year-old dragged his effort wide, hitting the post as Juventus reached the final of the Coppa Italia on away goals, where they will face the winner between Napoli and Inter Milan later this month. Reacting to the development, Bonucci defended Ronaldo, adding that the former Real Madrid star is always essential for the Serie A champions. “Even the greatest miss (penalties). Cristiano is always important for us,” Bonucci told Rai Sport. ‘He increases the pressure on opponents’ defenders. He was unfortunate today and (AC Milan goalkeeper Gianluigi) Donnarumma did well. “We’ll see a great Juventus and a great Ronaldo again.”

The World Health Organisation, WHO, has revealed the likely source of the new outbreak of Ebola virus in Republic of Congo.

He disclosed that investigations were still ongoing to determine the source of the new outbreak of Ebola. Tedros said “Genetic sequencing from new Ebola cases in Democratic Republic of Congo has revealed that the outbreak is not linked to north kivu or the 2018 equetor outbreak, investigations are ongoing to understand the source but likely a new introduction from an animal source.” DAILY POST recalls that WHO had on Tuesday confirmed eight fresh cases of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The agency reported that the cases were recorded in Wangata health zone, Mbandaka, in Équateur province and four patients have died of the disease.

Arsenal on Thursday confirmed that two players would leave the club on July 1 once their contracts expire. The Gunners disclosed this in a statement via its official website. The two players are Tobi Omole and Matthew Dennis. A club statement on Arsenal’s official website read: “Tobi Omole and Matthew Dennis will leave the club at the end of their contracts on July 1. “Everyone at the club would like to thank Tobi and Matthew for their contributions and wish them well in their future careers.” Omole joined Arsenal’s Hale End academy in 2014 and later signed his first professional deal with the North London club in 2018. The 20-year-old featured in fourteen Premier League 2 and four EFL Trophy appearances, scoring one goal for the club. Dennis, on the other hand, joined Arsenal’s academy at the age of six, after a successful trial period with the club. The second-year scholar made 28 appearances for Arsenal’s Under-18s. The winger scored three times, including a late winner against Southampton in this year’s FA Youth Cup fourth round.

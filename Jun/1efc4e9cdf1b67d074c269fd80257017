Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, has lambasted security agencies for not apprehending some supporters of the Minister of Transportation, Chibuike Amaechi, who recently threatened to destroy the state. Paulinus Nsirim, the State’s Commissioner for Information and Communications, quoted the Governor to have said this on Arise Television, while reacting to the threat by a pro-Amaechi group which has gone viral on social media. Wike expressed surprise that the threat does not mean anything to security agencies. Recall that after the video went viral on social media, Amaechi had cautioned his supporters and Rivers State people to steer clear of violence as that is not the best way to resolve any issue, stating that he is a man of peace. Governor Wike said these Amaechi’s supporters were courageous because their pay masters have assured them of security cover. He said it was unfortunate that a group of persons can now threaten to destroy the state and the security agencies cannot even speak about. “I will not go to court against anybody because the threat is in the public domain. It is obvious, that they have the Police, Department of State Security, Air Force, Navy and the Army,” Wike said. “Otherwise, how do you explain the long silence of the Nigeria security agencies over such threats already trending online. For whatever reasons, why won’t they bother about the person making such threats because of an internal problem within APC. “Remember, for the first time in the history of this country when Chibuike Amaechi was governor, he shut down the courts for two years. Based on that experience, more threats and attacks are seen. “The minister is now coming to say that he is not a man of violence which is not true. We are not children to be so deceived.” Wike recalled that during the campaign leading to the last general elections, the Minister came to the state chanting war songs but was not cautioned by anyone.

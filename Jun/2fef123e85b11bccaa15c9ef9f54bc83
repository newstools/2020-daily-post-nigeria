Manchester United had to cancel a friendly game against Stoke City on Tuesday, after one of the players from the Championship club tested positive for COVID-19. Stoke’s players were taken to a separate building at Carrington when they arrived. They were given the results of Monday’s tests shortly before the friendly, when they were informed one of their players had tested positive. United’s medical team were immediately alerted and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side were kept away from Stoke’s players and staff. A source at United’s training ground told the UK Mirror: “Stoke were rushed out of the Academy very quickly indeed. “United’s officials didn’t hang about – they had Stoke out of there really quickly as you’d imagine. “It could have been a scary situation but United’s protocols were absolutely spot on and prevented what could have been a major problem with the season now just days away.”

The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, on Monday frowned at the comment credited to the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, that Fulani will rule Nigeria forever. President-General of AYCF, Yerima Shettima, described the comment as “childish.” Recall that the body’s President-General, Bello Abdullahi Bodejo, had reportedly said Fulani had produced some of Nigeria’s presidents, hence will rule the country forever. Bodejo had said Fulanis owned Nigeria, adding that the race has concluded arrangements to flag-off its own security outfit. He had said the Fulani “produced Nigeria. They produced the first prime minister. If they produced the first president, another president, another president and so on, are they not the owner of the country? “Fulani are ruling Nigeria and they must continue to rule the country forever. That is the truth.” Reacting to the comment, Shettima, in
a chat with DAILY POST, assured that Nigeria belongs to everybody. According to Shettima: “He sounded childish, if somebody wakes up from his house and speaks out of experience then he should not be considered. “The country belongs to all of us so nobody can just wake up and say they must rule. “In politics nothing is must, there are democratic processes so I don’t know what he is talking about and he does not speak for the generality of the North.”

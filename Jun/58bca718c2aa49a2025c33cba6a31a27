Victor Giadom, who is laying claim to being the acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, has told members of the party to surrender to a “higher organ”. This follows a public endorsement from President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday. Buhari will attend a virtual National Executive Council (NEC) on Thursday, which will be put together by Giadom. Speaking on Channels Television’s Politics Wednesday, Giadom said he expects the President to attend the meeting, adding that all other APC excos have been invited. “My position is very clear. The National Working Committee cannot resolve the present situation in our party; a higher organ of the party, which is the National Executive Committee of the party has the responsibility to wade into the situation that we find ourselves. “But I am worried about some of my colleagues who do not want to surrender the situation that we find ourselves to a higher organ of the party that can find solution for all of us. “I, therefore, want to advise everybody, my colleagues and the entire NEC members to avail themselves to the zoom code that has been circulated to them and attend the meeting as scheduled,” Giadom said.

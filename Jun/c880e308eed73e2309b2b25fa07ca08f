Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he will not buy “rotten apples” and new signings must reflect his personality. During his first summer transfer window, Solskjaer signed Harry Maguire, Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka. The Norwegian then brought in Bruno Fernandes last January and Odion Ighalo on loan. But United continue to be linked with more names this summer. “I wouldn’t be able to look at myself if I didn’t know I’d given everything for my team-mates and my manager. “That’s what I also now look for in players that we sign or we bring up from the youth team. You have to have a good personality and that you are professional because one rotten apple in the basket will make the others rotten,” Solskjaer told the Shiv Nadar Foundation. United are scheduled to restart their Premier League campaign with a trip to Tottenham Hotspur on June 19.

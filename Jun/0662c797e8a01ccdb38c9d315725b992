A late-night inferno on Sunday destroyed property worth millions of naira in Akure, the Ondo State capital. The inferno which engulfed 13 shops and two houses occurred at Obanla area of the state capital, a few meters from the popular Oja-Oba market. The fire was suspected to have been caused by gas leaks as sources said that the inferno started from one of the shops where gas cylinders were stored. According to some eyewitnesses, the situation could have been salvaged if the men of the Stateâ€™s Fire Service had arrived at the scene on time. They argued that by the time the firemen arrived at the scene the buildings had turned to debris following hours of intense fire.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-803842" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FB_IMG_1592220857504.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FB_IMG_1592220857504.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FB_IMG_1592220857504-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> One of the shop owners who simply gave his name as Favour said he could not believe he watched his business burnt to the ground Favour said he was alerted on the phone late in the night but it was too late to salvage any goods from the shop by the time he arrived, as the fire had already consumed virtually everything in the shop.

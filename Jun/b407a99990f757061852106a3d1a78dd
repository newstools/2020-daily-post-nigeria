A policeman has allegedly killed a youth in Maiha Local Government Area of Adamawa State over an N100 tip. Arabo Dauda, a 20-year-old motorcyclist, was killed by the policemen for refusing his demand for N100, according to sources. The sources said Arabo who was passing a police checkpoint with a gallon of fuel he went to buy at a petrol station, was stopped by the alleged killer cop who insisted that he be given N100 before Arabo would pass. The sources said the killing of the young man is the result of the reckless shootings by policemen over bribes. Chairman of Maiha Local Government Council, Dr Idi Aminu, who identified young Arabo Dauda as being of Tambajam Ward of Wuro-ba Adamu village of Maiha, said the incident caused mass anger. “Angry youths vowed a reprisal attack,” he said, adding that the youths, in their frighteningly large numbers demanded the life of the policemen. “They were, however, prevented by the battle-ready soldiers who the policemen ran to seeking refuge” The Maiha council chairman said. He said he had been deeply involved in efforts to ensure that the situation remained calm, and assured that the offender had been summoned to the police state headquarters in Yola. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of Adamawa State, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, has not responded to the development as calls put to him were yet to be answered as at press time.

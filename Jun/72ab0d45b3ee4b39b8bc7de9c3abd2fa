A former Chelsea and Arsenal striker, Nicolas Anelka, has named Arsene Wenger and Sam Allardyce as the best managers he ever worked with. Anelka played under Wenger, Allardyce, Carlo Ancelotti, Vicente Del Bosque, Guus Hiddink, Luiz Felipe Scolari and Kevin Keegan during his career. But the former France international has described Wenger and Allardyce as managers who know how to get the best out of him. “For me, I take into consideration football, attitude, my understanding with the coach, mentality and how he used me on the field and because of this, there are only two names: Big Sam and Arsene Wenger,” Anelka told Bolton’s official website. “They knew how to use my qualities to get the best out of me.” Anelka is currently working as a youth coach at Lille. The 41-year-old played for 13 different clubs including Liverpool, Manchester City, Bolton, Juventus, Real Madrid, and PSG from 1996-2015.

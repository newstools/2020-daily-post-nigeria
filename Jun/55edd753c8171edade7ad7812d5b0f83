One person was critically injured, while five others reportedly sustained minor injuries on Tuesday in a communal clash over a land dispute in the Edu Local Government Area of Kwara State. Spokesman of the state Police Command, Mr, Ajayi Okasanmi, who confirmed this to DAILY POST in a phone chat said the clash which occurred between Lafiagi and Edogi communities was the result of a land dispute but no lives were lost. Okasanmi who spoke from the Lafiagi crisis spot said “we are on the ground at the crisis area and we have been able to put the situation under control.” DAILY POST learned that a court had delivered judgement favouring one of the two parties in the dispute but restrained the two communities from doing anything on the land pending the determination of the substantive case. The clash which broke out on Monday night lasted till Tuesday and was triggered by one of the rival community members who allegedly breached the court’s ruling and trespassed into the disputed land. The trespass allegedly provoked some angry youths from the other community who launched an attack leading to a free for all fight. While sources claim some residential houses were razed during the clash, Okasanmi said only one kiosk where an Edogi person was selling engine oil was burnt.

Ohanaeze Youth Council,(OYC), an Igbo socio-cultural Organization, has said it would liase with ethnic youth nationalities to chart a best approach to proffer functional solutions to tackle the security challenges ranging from Boko Haram, dreaded herdsmen, banditry and kidnapping. This was even as President Muhammadu Buhari has berated his Service Chiefs over the spate of insecurity across the country. Buhari said the Security Chiefs have not done their best in curbing the issue of insecurity in the country. The President also warned that “excuses will no longer be tolerated,” because he expects them to live up to expectations. But, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, the OYC President, in a statement made available to newsmen, on Friday evening, lamented the series of killings by dreaded herdsmen and kidnappers, asserting that it would adopt lawful and peaceful actions to end the mass killings being executed terrorists. Ohanaeze disclosed that youths from various ethnic nationalities in the country would meet consultactively to draw a new line of actions that would assist President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration and security agencies to curb the menace of killings by terrorists. Recall that Nigeria is currently faced with unending killings occasioned by the nefarious activities of the deadly Boko Haram sect. Nigeria has so far recorded about 4,000 deaths as a result of the mass killings of innocent citizens of the country by the wicked Islamic Sect.

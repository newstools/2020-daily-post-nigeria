Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich has reportedly approved two ‘big-money’ signings for manager, Frank Lampard, this summer’s transfer window. According to the Athletic, Abramovich is “enthusiastic” about the club’s future under Lampard and is prepared to fund the signings at the end of the 2019/20 season. Chelsea and Lampard failed to sign in any player in the last January transfer window. One of Chelsea’s top targets to sign this summer is Leicester City left-back, Ben Chilwell. RB Leipzig striker, Timo Werner, Bayer Leverkusen midfielder, Kai Havertz, Lyon forward, Moussa Dembele, and Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, are all on Chelsea’s shortlist. The Stamford Bridge club is also targeting Ajax’s Nicolas Tagliafico and Porto’s Alex Telles, but Chilwell is Lampard’s first choice. Speaking on his team, Lampard recently admitted that he is keen for Chelsea to sign a few players this summer. “I am certainly excited about the squad we have got, and we can get a few additions for areas I feel we need,” Lampard told Chelsea’s official magazine. “We did not bring in anyone in January.”

Former Arsenal midfielder, Santi Cazorla, has responded to Manager Mikel Arteta’s offer for him to return to Emirates. Cazorla, who currently plays for Villarreal, had reportedly been offered the chance to work as a coach in the North London club by Arteta this summer after he retires from football. The 35-year-old and Arteta were former teammates at Arsenal. Cazorla’s current deal with Villarreal will expire at the end of the season. Speaking on the development, Cazorla said he has made a decision on his future but would not reveal anything yet, adding that he may wish to continue playing for at least another season. “I have already made my decision, but right now is not the time to say anything,” Cazorla told Cadena SER. “I have an idea of what I want, but in due course, I will reveal what I have decided. “Now is not the time because we have to be focused on competing. “[The season suspension] has helped me think, listen to my body, but I do not want to pre-empt you or to speculate too much.” Cazorla added: “I do not know [if I will continue my playing career elsewhere], I have an idea, but when the time comes I will communicate it and give the explanations. “I want to remain linked to football. I could be a coach, but I see myself more in a sporting director role.” Cazorla won two FA Cup titles during his six years at Arsenal under former Gunners manager, Arsene Wenger.

The member representing Toro Federal Constituency of Bauchi State, Hon. Umar Lawal Muda has lamented the difficulty in the registration process for the federal government’s poverty alleviation programme, N-Power by his constituents. Speaking on Saturday, the lawmaker said the challenge his constituents and other Nigerians encounter in registering for the N-Power programme was putting them under pressure. While faulting the processes of registration, the lawmaker argued that those in rural communities around the country would be deprived, thereby eroding the essence of N-Power that was actually meant for them. He explained that there are no available Internet facilities and the lack of financial institutions in rural communities are factors militating against the success of the programme among rural dwellers. He said: “This is why rural dwellers are disadvantaged and left out of the government’s social welfare and protection programme, it is our collective responsibility to fill the gaps and create a level playing ground for everyone. “All potential applicants have no bank accounts and therefore could not boast of the Bank Verification Number (BVN) code as required by N-Power. “The N-Power programme is said to be “open for all” regardless of education and social status, but it doesn’t provide any alternative to Online Application.

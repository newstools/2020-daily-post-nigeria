The legislative arm of Ovia South-West Local Government Area of Edo has suspended three of its councillors indefinitely over alleged illegal sitting where they purportedly carried out the suspension of the leader and the Chief Whip of the House. Councillors suspended include; Mr. Thompson Idubor Iyase, representing Udo Ward, Mr. Desmond Owenvbiugie, representing Usen Ward and Miss Blessing Perewari, representing Ofunama ward. Three out of the 10 councillors in the council, had two weeks ago, suspended the leader and his Deputy, which allegedly happened in the private residence of a very influential chieftain of the party. This was part of the resolutions made by the six councillors during their plenary on Tuesday. The leader of the legislative arm, Rt. Hon. Robert Ekeme Fiyes, who presided over the sitting, also lifted the suspension of the council’s Vice Chairman, Mr Fred Aimienwanwu who was also illegally suspended by the three councillors. In its resolutions, the legislative arm of the Ovia South-West LGA also summoned the council Chairman, Comr Destiny Enabulele to render the income and expenditure of the council to the House. He further said the signatures of the seven councillors who did not partake in the alleged removal were forged. “We are not aware of any impeachment; our signatures were forged into a document and three of our members went to the house of a leader of APC who is not even from our local government but in government and purportedly removed the leaders and suspended a councillor. “The allegation is that we are not loyal to the chairman who is supporting Governor Obaseki,” he said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-811170 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200630-WA0013.jpg" alt="" width="756" height="1008" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200630-WA0013.jpg 756w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200630-WA0013-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 756px) 100vw, 756px">

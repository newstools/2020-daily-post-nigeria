The Deputy National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Victor Giadom, is insisting he is the Acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Giadom arrived at the APC’s national secretariat Abuja this morning, where he held a press conference. He called for the screening exercise that resulted in the disqualification of the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, to be cancelled and asked the aspirants to reappear for fresh screening. On Tuesday night, the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) appointed the immediate past governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, as the acting National Chairman. This follows the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole by an Appeal Court. However, Giadom argues that he has the legal backing to replace Oshiomhole. According to him, a High Court order has rendered Ajimobi’s appointment null and void and of no effect.

CSP Nnudam Fredrick, command spokesman, said the community leader in Ikot Inyang in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area allegedly defiled an 11-year-old girl. He said, the community leader, 60, bought bean-cake (akara) from the 11-year-old and asked her to follow him to his room in order to take her money. “On reaching the room, the suspect grabbed the victim and forcefully raped her,” he added Fredrick said the command also received intelligence report, and arrested a pastor in one of the churches in Ntak Inyang in Etim Ekpo LGA for allegedly defiling an eight-year-old girl. The victim was sent by her guardian to deliver a tin of milk to the pastor when the pastor allegedly raped her. Three other persons were also arrested for alleged defilement and rape. The suspects lured a 26-year-old lady to their house and unlawfully assaulted her with fist blows and machete. Fredrick said the suspects who also raped her in the process would be arraigned in court on completion of investigations. He, therefore, assured that it would tackle the issue of rape, gender-based violence and other crimes by ensuring the perpetrators are brought to book.

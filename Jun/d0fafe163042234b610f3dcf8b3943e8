Former Arsenal player, Charlie Nicholas and former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov have predicted the scoreline between Southampton and Arsenal when both teams clash in today’s Premier League fixture at the St. Mary’s Stadium. Nicholas predicted that Southampton and Arsenal would play a 2-2 draw, while Berbatov backed the Gunners to defeat the host 2-1. Arsenal head to the match following a 2-1 defeat against Brighton in their last game, while Southampton won Norwich City 3-0. Writing in his column for Sky Sports, Nicholas said: “How do you work it out for Arsenal? The defence is poor – Mikel Arteta left Kieran Tierney out, but he does need games to get fit. He needs games to get confidence, but how do you get that in this defence? He has been brought into this. “I do not know what his midfield selection is. Matteo Guendouzi is a talent, but he needs experience with him, while Dani Ceballos is good on the ball but not without it, and we are in an absolute mess at the minute. “We do not usually get something at Southampton, and the top four is long gone, but I would be grateful for yet another draw, just to get the point on the board. Southampton 2, Arsenal 2.” On his part, Berbatov said in his column for Metro: “I don’t want to see Arsenal lose three in a row, saying that Danny Ings is back from the restart scoring, so this isn’t going to be an easy one for Arsenal, but they really need to finally start showing some balls and I think they just might in this one. Southampton 1, Arsenal 2.” The match is scheduled at 6 pm Nigerian time.

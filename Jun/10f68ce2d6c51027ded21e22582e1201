Popular singer, Wizkid has berated Nigerian pastors over their inability to heal coronavirus patients. Wizkid said he has never heard about any pastor who was brave enough to go into isolation centres to heal COVID-19 patients. In a tweet on his verified Twitter handle, Wizkid wrote: “I have not seen any Naija pastor go to isolation centres to heal anybody from COVID-19.” Recall that Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries had urged the Federal government to allow pastors entrance into isolation centers to pray for COVID-19 patients. However, as at Thursday night, Nigeria recorded 14,554. This followed the confirmation of 681 cases by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC.

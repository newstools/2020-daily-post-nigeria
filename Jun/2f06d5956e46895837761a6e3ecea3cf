Bukola Saraki, immediate past President of the Senate, has taken a swipe at Adams Oshiomhole, following the defection of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State from the All Progressives Congress to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Saraki, in a statement on Friday, by his media aide, Yusuph Olaniyonu, welcomed Obaseki to the PDP. The former Governor of Kwara State said Oshiomhole had continued to divide APC and would soon meet his waterloo. Saraki added that the fate of the suspended APC Chairman should serve as a lesson to all politicians. Obaseki dumped the APC days after he was disqualified from contesting the governorship primary election on its platform. Saraki, however, applauded the PDP governors for their roles in ensuring that Obaseki defected to the party. The statement read in part: “The truth is always constant and no matter how far falsehood travels, the truth will catch up with it one day. “What is happening to Oshimhole now is a moment of truth. This same man who was garrulously proclaiming the end of the political career of some other people is now about to meet his waterloo. “He has continued to use his mouth to divide his party and I believe there is a lesson for all politicians to learn from the fate of the suspended APC chairman. “No autocrat can successfully pretend to be a Democrat. The true character of a man will come out one day,” Saraki added.

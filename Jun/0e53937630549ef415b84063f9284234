Real Madrid returned to LaLiga action for the first time since March this year, with a 3-1 win over Eibar on Sunday night. Zinedine Zidaneâ€™s men flew out of the blocks at the Alfred Di Stefano, to all but win the game in the opening half. Toni Kroos, Sergio Ramos and Marcelo scored to give Madrid a 3-0 lead at the interval. The visitors pulled one back through Pedro Bigas, but it was a rather comfortable victory for Los Blancos. The win takes them within two points of rivals Barcelona, who crushed Mallorca 4-0 yesterday. Barca host Leganes next, while Real Madrid clash with Valencia.

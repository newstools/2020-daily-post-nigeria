The All Progressives Congress, APC, in Ondo State has asked the Deputy Governor of the State, Agboola Ajayi to resign without further delay in the interest of peace. Recall that Ajayi formally left the ruling party at the weekend and defected to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, after a protracted crisis between him and the State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu. The APC, in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Rotimi Fashakin, said it was better for the Deputy Governor to honourably resign since he was sponsored by the party on the same ticket with Governor Akeredolu. The party said it was worrisome and unfortunate that the Deputy Governor and the Governor ended the journey which commenced in one accord a few years back this way. “We wished Ajayi had not taken this decision, after a series of efforts and attempts by royal fathers and party leaders, from within and outside the state to forestall this migration,” the party said. “The State Working Committee is taken aback by a reported statement credited to Ajayi that he would remain the deputy governor as long as his people have not asked him to quit. This statement is vexatious. “It is imperative to remind Ajayi that he ran on an APC ticket given to Akeredolu and both were sponsored by the party. Now that he chooses to defect, the party advises Ajayi to toe the path of wisdom, and resign honourably,” the ruling party said. The APC said it will be willing to reabsorb him and his followers whenever the Deputy Governor decided to come back to the ruling party.

Former Arsenal midfielder, Charlie Nicholas, has urged manager, Mikel Arteta, to sell Mesut Ozil and Shkodran Mustafi once the next transfer window opens this summer. Nicholas also claimed that Mustafi is not supposed to be an Arsenal player because he is not good enough. Ozil and Mustafi have faced criticism at Arsenal in recent seasons for their contributions to the North London club. Both German stars’ contracts at Arsenal will expire next summer, and it is unlikely the Gunners will offer either player an extension. That means both players, who cost Arsenal a combined total of around £80million, will be allowed to leave Emirates for nothing. “The problem still facing Arsenal is how do we get Mesut Ozil out the building with the wages he’s on?” Nicholas was quoted by Mirror UK as saying. “Will he stay and play just because he’s on big money? How do we start to get players like Shkodran Mustafi out the door when they are on big money?” “We have a problem with identifying players. Then what we did is we started paying £30 million, £40million for Mustafi and defenders who in all honesty, no disrespect to them it is only my opinion, are not cut out for Arsenal and have not been good enough. “So they have been buying wrong. The players then realised they are not a threat to win the English Premier League or we are out of the UEFA Champions League. “So the [Arsenal] hierarchy have got it all wrong.”

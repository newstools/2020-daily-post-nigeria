One of the All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirants for this year’s Edo state governorship election, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has mocked Governor Godwin Obaseki, over his decision to leave the party. Obaseki was disqualified from participating in the APC primaries this month and has now decamped to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Subsequently, PDP now granted him waiver to seek its ticket for the election. Ize-Iyamu has now claimed Obaseki attempted to impose himself as the candidate of the ruling party before he was disqualified. “He (Obaseki) has now left the party, following his rightful disqualification. Many party members heaved a sigh of relief when he left and currently, we are closing ranks and unifying the party for the election,” he told the Sun. “Should my party elect me at the primaries on June 22, all the issues you speak of will be resolved in no time because really, they are all political. As aforementioned, we are already reaching out to everyone involved now that the bad apple has voluntarily taken itself out of the bag.”

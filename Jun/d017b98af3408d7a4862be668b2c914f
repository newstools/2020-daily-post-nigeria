Barcelona youngster, Ansu Fati, has ruled out any possibility of leaving Camp Nou for Manchester United or any other club this summer’s transfer window. Recall that Fati had drawn the interest of Man United in the past few weeks. Man United view Fati as a viable alternative to Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, one of their priority targets for this summer. However, according to Mundo Deportivo, Fati is not considering an exit from Barcelona and has zero interest in joining Man United. Fati has made 25 appearances for Barcelona so far this season, scoring six goals. His release clause at Barca is £362million. The 17-year-old came through Barcelona’s La Masia academy.

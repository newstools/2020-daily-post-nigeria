Manchester City winger, Riyad Mahrez, has named Liverpool’s forward, Sadio Mane, as the player that should win the English Premier League Player of the 2019/2020 season. The annual Professional Footballers’ Association, PFA, Awards would have been scheduled to take place on April 26, but have naturally been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But Mahrez believes the Senegal international deserves the award because he has improved a lot technically, adding that he scores many goals now. Asked who should win the award, the Algeria captain told BT Sport: “I think it would be Mane. “Not too many skills, he’s not a player of skills, but he’s efficient. “He scores goals, like (Mohamed) Salah, When he was at Southampton, he was good, but he wasn’t as good as now. “He’s improved a lot technically and in front of the goal. He scores a lot of goals now because he improved a lot. ‘So yeah, I think this year it should be him.” Mane scored in Liverpool’s 4-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace on Wednesday night to take his goal tally for Jurgen Klopp’s side to 17 in all competitions so far this term.

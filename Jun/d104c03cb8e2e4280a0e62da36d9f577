A former Minister of Transportation, Chief Ebenezer Babatope, has insisted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) was not fair to Governor Godwin Obaseki by disqualifying him from participating in the party’s primary election. Babatope said this on Saturday in Lagos during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). DAILY POST recalls that Obaseki was disqualified from the party’s governorship primary, scheduled for June 22 by the APC screening committee. Reacting to the development, Babatope said Obaseki’s disqualification was a punishment meted to the governor for doing nothing. Babatope said: “You know I’m not a member of the APC, but I must say what the party has done to the governor is not fair. “We should have gotten to a stage in this country where politicians look at issues dispassionately and not because they belong to a particular party. “They are just punishing him for doing nothing really. “Obaseki contested and won on your platform the first term, nothing was wrong. “Are you just seeing all the issues with his certificates now? Too bad.”

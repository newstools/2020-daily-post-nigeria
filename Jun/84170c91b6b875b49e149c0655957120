Arsenal returned to action for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Premier League to be put on hold, hammering Charlton Athletic 6-0 in a friendly played on Saturday at an empty Emirates Stadium. Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang gave the Gunners a two-goal lead before half time. Eddie Nketiah netted a second-half hat-trick, while Joe Willock also got on the scoresheet. Premier League clubs have been given the all-clear to play friendlies ahead of the scheduled restart on June 17. Arsenal, who are ninth in the standings, are away to Manchester City on June 17 on the first day of the Premier Leagueâ€™s return.

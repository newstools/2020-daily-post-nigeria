Residents of Yabu and Ijegwu communities in Yala Local Government Area of Cross River State have deserted their villages over renewed communal clashes. DAILY POST gathered that the conflict was over a parcel of land between the two communities, which has been in dispute and ended in exchange of gunshots and machete cuts recently. Properties worth millions of naira were destroyed while many people sustained injuries during the clash. Sadly, the villagers have deserted the area following the conflict and the place is now quiet, except occasional exchange of gunfire. A resident of the area told newsmen that the elders of the two communities have met severally to make peace but were not able to reach a peace accord until youths took to arms. “The land in dispute adjoins both communities and there have been scuffles in the past but no exchange of gunfire until yesterday, ‘Sunday” when the two villages went to war,” a source said. He said many people have deserted the area following the conflict and that the place was now quiet except occasional exchange of gunfire. DSP Irene Ugbo, Cross River Police Command spokesman, who confirmed the development, said anti-riot policemen have been sent to the area.

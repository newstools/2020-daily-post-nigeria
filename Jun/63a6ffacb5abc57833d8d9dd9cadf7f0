An Edo State High Court of Justice sitting in Ekpoma, has restrained the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP; the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and others, from removing, excluding, preventing, or purporting to exclude or prevent any of the aspirants who have been cleared by the party from contesting in the governorship primary, according to Channels Television. The PDP primary is slated for Thursday, June 24. Recall that a Federal High court sitting in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, had earlier restrained the Governor of Edo State Godwin Obaseki from participating in the PDP primary election. One of the party’s aspirants, Omoregir Ogbeide-Ihiama, had approached the court, asking for the Governor, who just joined the PDP from the All Progressives Congress, APC, to be stopped from participating in the primaries. Omoregir Ogbeide-Ihama argued that since Obaseki was not part of the candidates screened by the PDP National Working Committee, NWC initially before the date on the timetable lapsed, he should not be allowed to participate in the primaries. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-808680" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-19-02-49-768x1024-1.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-19-02-49-768x1024-1.jpg 768w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-19-02-49-768x1024-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-808679" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-19-02-49-1-768x1024-1.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-19-02-49-1-768x1024-1.jpg 768w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-19-02-49-1-768x1024-1-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-808681" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-18-58-57.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-18-58-57.jpg 768w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-18-58-57-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-808682" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-18-58-56.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-18-58-56.jpg 768w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/PHOTO-2020-06-23-18-58-56-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"> Details later…

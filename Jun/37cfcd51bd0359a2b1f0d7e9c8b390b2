Manchester City will find out next month if their appeal against their two-year European ban has been successful. On Monday, The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) began hearing City’s appeal for allegedly breaching UEFA’s Financial Play Play rules. The hearing was held via video conference at their headquarters in Lausanne. It is expected to last three days and CAS general secretary, Matthieu Reeb, says they could now deliver their verdict in July, even before City resume their Champions League campaign. “The hearing has started well and the video conference is working well,” Reeb told reporters. UEFA banned City from European competition for two years and fined them £25m for allegedly overstating sponsorship revenue, to hide their non-compliance of their FFP rules between 2012 and 2016.

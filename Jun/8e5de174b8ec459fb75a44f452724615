The Federal Capital Territory Administration, FCTA, on Monday, kicked off the implementation of the State Community Policing in the nation’s capital. The initiative is aimed at reducing crime in communities and deepens the trust between the public and law enforcement agencies. Malam Muhammad Bello, the FCT Minister, stated this while inaugurating the 16-member State Community Policing Advisory Committee, SCPAC, for FCT, in Abuja. Bello said that with the Presidential approval granted for community-oriented policing across the country, Nigeria would start to witness a reduction in crime rate. The Minister, therefore, advised members of the committee to take the assignment very seriously and give it the utmost attention it deserved. Bello said: “Once there is a trust deficit in any guise or form, the workability of this policy becomes highly diminished, and we will have lost a great opportunity in improving the security profile of the territory. “It is necessary that selection into the Special Constabulary is fair and just with proper screening. “Those selected should also be provided with the necessary training needed for the job. There should also be a robust feedback and monitoring mechanism for the performance of those appointed to carry out tasks within the communities. “There should also be confidentiality of investigation and protection of informants.”

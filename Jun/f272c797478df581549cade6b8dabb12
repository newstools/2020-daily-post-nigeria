Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has been order to pay his former club £6.1million, after he lost a lawsuit over unpaid bonus. Barca confirmed in a statement on Friday, that Neymar’s claim to a £39.5m payment has been “fully dismissed”. The Brazilian left the Spanish club for PSG in 2017 for a world record fee of £201m (€222m). But the 28-year-old sought a court ruling concerning the terms of the last contract he signed at the Nou Camp a year earlier. Neymar had been linked with a return to the Nou Camp over the last year with a move close last summer, but the court ruling appears to have now ended any potential future move.

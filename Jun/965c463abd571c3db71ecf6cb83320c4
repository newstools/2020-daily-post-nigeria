FA Cup replays could be scrapped from next season, as the organizers look at dealing with fixture congestion, the UK Sun reports. The 2020/2021 season is not likely to kick off until the middle of September at the earliest, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. As a result, teams will have a hectic schedule if they progress both in domestic cups and European competitions. Because of this, replays might be scrapped, with ties to be decided by extra time or penalties, if there is no winner within 90 minutes. Replays from the fifth round onwards had already been disposed off this season, with Norwich beating Tottenham on penalties at that stage. And there could be more penalty shootouts in the competition next season.

FIFA has announced a new change to their rules that will allow the Premier League, La Liga and other European leagues to open this summer’s transfer window before the 2019/20 campaign ends. The Premier League will return on June 17, with Tottenham Hotspur hosting Manchester United and Manchester City facing Arsenal, while the La Liga resumed on June 11. FIFA, in a statement via its official website on Thursday, said: “The new temporary regulatory amendments approved by the Bureau of the Council are as follows: “To avoid any concerns regarding unemployed players, players are permitted to be registered with a maximum of three clubs and are eligible to play in official matches for three clubs during the same season. “To give priority to clubs to complete their (2019/20) season with their original squad, provide flexibility, and allow MAs to plan their football calendar properly, those associations following a dual-year calendar are permitted to commence the “first registration period” for the 2020/21 season before the completion of the 2019/20 season, subject to certain conditions.”

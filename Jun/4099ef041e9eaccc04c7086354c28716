Chelsea wants to sign Bayer Leverkusen midfielder, Kai Havertz, this summer, Sky Sports reports. The Bundesliga outfit is yet to receive an official offer for Havertz, but it is believed Bayern Munich and Real Madrid have held talks with the club. Blues owner, Roman Abramovich, is ready to back manager Frank Lampard significantly in the market. Chelsea has already agreed on a deal for RB Leipzig striker, Timo Werner, beating domestic rivals Liverpool to the German. Hakim Ziyech will officially move to Stamford Bridge from Ajax in July. Leicester left-back, Ben Chilwell, however, remains Chelseaâ€™s No 1 target this summer. Havertz is under contract at Leverkusen until June 2022. He has scored 15 goals and made eight assists across 38 games in all competitions so far in the 2019/2020 season.

The Ondo State Commissioner of Police, Salami Bolaji has said that the Ondo Police Command under his policing architecture will never police lawlessness in the State. Salami while reacting to a video on social media of his purported confrontation with the Deputy Governor of Ondo State over some number of cars, said the video was an attempt to foment sentiment and misunderstanding in the State. On Saturday night, Ajayi was prevented from leaving the Government House when he was stopped by the Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami who was said to be acting on Akeredolu’s order. Salami further said, he only came to the scene when his officers and men at the government house could not broker peace between the aides of the governor and that of the deputy governor over the number of cars the Deputy governor would drive out at the time. According to the CP, it is only necessary that his presence at the scene as the Command’s Commissioner of Police could calm frayed nerves. He also said, having listened to the reason for the misunderstanding, advised both sides to come to terms, a condition they both agreed. The police boss who said he has never been a politician all through his life and would not want to be dragged into politics affirmed that he is completely apolitical and as a police officer, his job is to protect the lives and properties of citizens of Ondo State.

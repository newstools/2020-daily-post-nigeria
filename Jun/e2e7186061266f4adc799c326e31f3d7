Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has admitted his side escaped with a point against rivals Everton on Sunday night. The hosts had the best chance to score late in the game, after Alisson Becker saved Dominic Calvert-Lewin’s effort. Tom Davies then hit the post from the rebound. The result means Klopp’s men will now win the title against Crystal Palace on Wednesday, provided Manchester City fail to beat Burnley on Monday. “I liked our defending and high midfield press but we didn’t have enough chances for the possession we had. We were dominant but they had the biggest chance and that’s how it is. “We were lucky in that moment. In the end, Everton defended really well and we were not smart enough to use the space we had,” Klopp told Sky Sports.

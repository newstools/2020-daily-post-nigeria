Bishop David Oyedepo of Living Faith Church, on Sunday, disclosed that his church recorded 114 COVID-19 healings. Oyedepo, who is the founder of Living Faith said the above number testified of being healed from COVID-19. He spoke during his sermon at the church’s headquarters in Ota, Ogun State, while faulting the partial reopening of markets. The cleric lamented that market places where people no longer observe social distancing or hygiene remain open but the church is being suppressed. According to Oyedepo: “Can anybody silence the church? Never! I have never heard of anybody that God healed in the market but people get healed in every church day and night, real tangible healing. “We have recorded 114 coronavirus healing testimonies. We got 10 this week. “And that is the place that is vulnerable, not the market.” Statistics from the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, says the country currently has 24,077 recorded cases of COVID-19. This followed NCDC’s confirmation of 779 cases on Saturday night.

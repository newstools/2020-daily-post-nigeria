Some persons suspected to be armed thugs invaded the Water Board promises in Calabar Municipality in Cross River State on Monday morning in a clear attempt to snatch the official Hilux vehicle of the Chairman of the water board, Godwin Igile. An eyewitness, who is a senior staff of water board and preferred anonymity, said for fear of severe sanction, he will not reveal his name but regretted the incident, noting that it was a shameful act. “What is in a vehicle that Managing Director, Victor Effiom can order suspected armed thugs to retrieve from a chairman of the board?” he queried. “The incident occurred this morning when the Chairman of the Board arrived at the board and the driver dropped him and while he (Driver) was negotiating to park the car, some thugs who were stood by pounced on him. “The suspected thugs numbering over three inflicted injuries on the driver who was rescued by some workers and the car key retrieved from them,” the eyewitness said. At the time of filing this report, the driver was said to be receiving treatment at an undisclosed health facility in Calabar. When DAILY POST spoke with the Chairman, Godwin Igile via phone Tuesday night, he neither confirmed nor denied the story but referred our correspondent to the Permanent Secretary of the Board, Joseph Bassey, who refused to answer his calls. However, the Permanent Secretary in the Governor’s Office who is in charge of security, confirmed the story, “The boys were sent there by the Managing Director Victor Effiom to retrieve the vehicle,” he stated.

The Premier League received a major boost in a bid to restart on June 17, after the latest round of COVID-19 tests produced no new positive cases. A total of 1,195 players and club staff were tested in the sixth round of screening, which was carried out on Thursday and Friday. “The Premier League can confirm that on Thursday 4 June and Friday 5 June, 1,195 players and club staff were tested for COVID-19. Of these, zero have tested positive,” the league said in a statement. This means there have been only 13 positive results from an overall 6,274 tests carried out on Premier League players and club staff. Testing will continue twice weekly, as officials look to resume the season that was put on hold in March.

The Nigerian government on Monday eased the lockdown in Kano State. President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive was disclosed by Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. Speaking at the daily briefing of the taskforce in Abuja, Mustapha also introduced phase one of the eased lockdown. He said: “Easing the total lockdown of Kano State and introduction of Phase One of the eased lockdown. “This is still a fight for life and our advancement to phase two does not mean that COVID-19 has ended. It is still potent and highly wasteful of human lives. “I implore all Nigerians and corporate citizens to take responsibility and play the expected role.” Mustapha had earlier announced the lifting of ban on religious gathering across the country. Recall that the Kano State Governor, Umar Ganduje, had in May extended the lockdown earlier imposed by the federal government on the state, following increasing cases of COVID-19. Ganduje had extended the lockdown by two weeks.

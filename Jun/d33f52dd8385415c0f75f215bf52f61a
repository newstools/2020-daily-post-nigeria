Chelsea are now favourites to sign Timo Werner from RB Leipzig. Werner has a €55m (£49.4m) release clause, which expires on Monday, June 15. Although the German striker looked set to sign for Chelsea’s Premier League rivals Liverpool, it is believed the Blues are now in front of the queue. The UK Mirror claims the Stamford Bridge club has offered Werner a five-year deal which will see him earn £200,000 per week. The 24-year-old wants to move to a Champions League club, where he will play regularly. He has scored 32 times this season, including 25 goals in 29 Bundesliga games.

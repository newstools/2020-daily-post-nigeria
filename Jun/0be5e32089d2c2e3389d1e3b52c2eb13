Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has criticized the UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, over how he handled the COVID-19 outbreak. Klopp feels his response to the pandemic is the reason the UK now has one of the highest death tolls in the world. According to the Reds boss, he was not too bothered about his side, missing out on their first Premier League title in 30 years. Klopp, however, admits he was worried the season would be cancelled, with Liverpool 25 points clear at the top. “I didn’t vote for this Government. This Government was the choice of other people. And the problem I had was that I got the news from England and the news from Germany. “From a personal point of view, I don’t understand why we started wearing face masks in closed areas on June 15 when five or six weeks ago, all the other countries were doing it,” Klopp told a Zoom press conference. Liverpool will be hoping to take a step further towards this title when they take on Merseyside rivals Everton in Sunday’s late kick-off.

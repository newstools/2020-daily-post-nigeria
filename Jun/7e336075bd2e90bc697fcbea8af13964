Liverpool defender, Virgil van Dijk, will sign a £220,000-per-week deal to become the highest-paid player in the club’s history, the UK Sun reports. The Reds are keen to tie the Dutchman down, with recent rumours linking him with a move to Paris Saint-Germain. However, an agreement is not expected to be reached quickly, with Jurgen Klopp’s men looking to wrap up their first title win in over 30 years. Liverpool travel to Everton for a Merseyside Derby on June 21. They could win their 19th league title at the home of their rivals, if Manchester City lose to Arsenal at the Etihad on June 17. Once the title is secured, Van Dijk will pen a five-year contract worth a whopping £57million.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, in Lagos on Tuesday, arraigned one Rahul Pathania, an Indian, and a vessel, M.V. Bount, before Justice Rilwan. M. Aikawa of the Federal High Court sitting in Ikoyi, Lagos State. He was arraigned on a three-count charge bordering on illegal dealing in petroleum products. The defendant was arrested alongside the vessel by the Nigerian Navy and subsequently handed over to the Commission for prosecution. One of the counts read: “That you, M.V.Bount and Rahul Pathania, on the 31st day of January 2020, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, conspired among yourselves to commit an offence to wit: dealing in 45 metric tons of petroleum product without appropriate licence and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 3(6) of the Miscellaneous Offences Act Cap M17, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, and punishable under Section 1(7) of the same Act.” The defendant pleaded guilty to the first count of conspiracy but not guilty to the others.

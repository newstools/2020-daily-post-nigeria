British Government on Tuesday announced that dexamethasone will now be used on COVID-19 patients. The government made the announcement after researchers in the UK identified a new drug, which has reduced COVID-19 deaths risk. The drug has reduced death risk for patients in ventilators by one-third and oxygen by one fifth. The drug, which is cheap and widely available can help save the lives of patients seriously ill with COVID-19. UK experts claim that the low-dose steroid treatment which was tested between March and June is a major breakthrough in the fight against the disease. According to BBC, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was a genuine case to celebrate â€œa remarkable British scientific achievement. He, therefore, added that the government has taken steps to ensure enough supplies. Currently, there are 8,194,790 confirmed coronavirus cases and 443,231 deaths worldwide.

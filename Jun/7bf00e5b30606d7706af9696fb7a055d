The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has advised passengers to arrive three hours before take-off time, ahead of the resumption of flights. According to FAAN, this was necessary, to allow passengers go through mandatory COVID-19 checks. The aviation agency shared the information in a tweet on Monday. “#COVID-19 Flight Resumption Protocol for Passengers: You are advised to arrive at the airport three hours before your flight due to the new COVID-19 safety checks,” FAAN tweeted. The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 recently announced June 21, as the tentative date for the resumption of domestic flights. The PTF, however, said the resumption of flights will depend on the readiness of airlines and aviation agencies.

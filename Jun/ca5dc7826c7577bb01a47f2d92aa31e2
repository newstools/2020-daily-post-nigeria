President Muhammadu Buhari is yet to appoint Monica Dongban-Mensem as the substantive president of the Court of Appeal because she is still being screened by relevant security agencies. This was revealed by Buhari’s spokesperson, Garba Shehu, in a statement on Sunday. Since Zainab Bulkachuwa retired in March this year. Dongban-Mensem has been acting as head of the appellate court. Although the National Judicial Council (NJC) recommended her as the substantive head of the court, Buhari has not sent Dongbam-Mensem’s name to the Senate for confirmation. Rather, he extended her tenure as acting president until September. “In the specific case of the acting president of the Court of Appeal, Her Lordship Justice M. S Dongban-Mensem, the statutory regulatory time of her acting period has not lapsed. “This is not about ethnicity or religion. It is about security and law enforcement agencies being allowed to complete their work,” part of the statement read.

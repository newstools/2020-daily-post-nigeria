Oyeleke Simeon Adegbola (Ogo-Oluwa /Surulere) Folarin who spoke on behalf of the lawmakers said Ajimobi’s death came as a rude shock to all the lawmakers. He said “Our great leader was full of life and radiated good health the last time we met. In fact, he looked younger than his age. “Though our Oga is no more, his legendary achievements as a public administrator lives on. He was undoubtedly and universally acknowledged as the Architect of Modern Oyo State; his records in the governance of Oyo State will be very difficult to match”. “We salute our fallen leader for his qualitative services to Nigeria and the APC. We will always remember him for his hard work, dedication and commitment.”

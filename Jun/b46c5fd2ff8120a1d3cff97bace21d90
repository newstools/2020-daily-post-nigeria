Former Liverpool player, Didi Hamann believes Bayer Leverkusen’s Kai Havertz should choose Chelsea over Manchester United as he looks to join a club in the Premier League. Havertz will leave Bayer Leverkusen once this summer’s transfer window opens, having built up the reputation as one of Europe’s best young midfielders. Chelsea appears to be the favourite club in the Premier League to land Havertz, but Frank Lampard’s side could still face some competition from Man United. European giants, Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are also said to be involved in the transfer race for Havertz, who is valued at £75million. But Hamann favours Chelsea over the Red Devils as a destination for the 20-year-old. Speaking on the development, Hamann told Sky Sports Germany, “Man United has lost its appeal in recent years, they are still the largest club in England, but they have major internal problems. “When a player like Kai Havertz changes clubs and signs somewhere for 5 years, the long-term Perspective is more important than participating in next season’s UEFA Champions League. “The player may have to make the decision in the next few weeks and can’t wait until the season in England ends in late July or early August. “Perspective is important for a player, but Manchester has been in a vacuum for years. “On the other hand, if I look at Chelsea, they have a coach with Frank Lampard who did a great job for the club as a player and I have the feeling that the Blues are growing again. “If Kai Havertz were to be added, it would be an incredibly exciting and interesting story. “If I think about where I see the clubs now, and in 2 or 3 years, the decision for Chelsea would be a relatively easy one for me as a player.”

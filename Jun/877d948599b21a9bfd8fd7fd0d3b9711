Former governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has reacted to the drama on Sunday in Ondo State where the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi was prevented from exiting the Government House. DAILY POST reported that Ajayi on Saturday night was stopped from leaving the Government House by the Commissioner of Police, Bolaji Salami, who was said to be acting on Akeredolu’s order. But, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu while defending the police operative, said they were only trying to prevent looting by the Deputy Governor’s aides. Hours later, the deputy governor defected to the People Democratic Party, PDP. Reacting, Fayose condemned the harassment by the police and manhandling of the deputy governor by the Police Commissioner. According to him, this depicts how democracy is being threatened under the All progressives Congress, APC. On his twitter page, Fayose wrote: “Even if the Deputy Governor is decamping to another party, does that give the Police Commissioner the right to hold him hostage? “Is there any law in this country, permitting police to prevent a Deputy Governor from using his official vehicles just because he is changing political parties? “That’s the level of threat that democracy is facing in our country under this APC and sadly, the President who should be the leader of the party cannot manage his immediate family not to talk of managing his party or the affairs of the nation.”

The factional Chairman of the Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Col. David Imuse, has listed some of the wrongdoings of Governor Godwin Obaseki which allegedly led to his disqualification from the June 22 primaries. Imuse, speaking to reporters in Benin City, claimed he had evidence that Obaseki worked against APC, by funding candidates of the opposition in the House of Assembly elections. According to him, the ease with which Obaseki was welcomed by the opposition, is an appreciation for his alleged investment. “Obaseki’s sins are legion. He has kept 14 members-elect of the House of Assembly out, he funded the long-drawn-out but aborted attempt to unseat the National Chairman. This drama is still playing‎ out in court as we speak, and was reflected in the Appeal Court ruling that was delivered yesterday,’ Imuse said. “He has also sponsored several litigations against the party, its organs and officials. Obaseki did everything within his power to weaken the APC and its structures preparatory to his defection. This was all in a bid to put the APC in a disadvantaged position in the forthcoming governorship elections in Edo State. So it is gratifying to have him exit from our ranks,” Imuse said. Speculation was rife that Obaseki will decamp to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) after he met with two PDP Governors – Nyesom Wike of Rivers state and Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom state last week.

A faction of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State says it has rejected the Governor Hope Uzodinma-led committee on the conduct of the party’s primary in the state. Anselm Ojezua, the factional chairman, made known the rejection in a statement he issued in Benin on Friday. The APC’s National Working Committee (NWC) had on Thursday, constituted the election committee led by Uzodinma to conduct a direct primary in Edo. “Our attention has been drawn to reports that a primary election committee has been inaugurated by the Hilliard Eta-led faction of the National Working Committee of our party to conduct the party’s primaries in Edo State,” Ojezua said. “This purported inauguration is reported to have been done while the controversy is raging as to the proper officer to take over from Adams Oshiomhole. “We have on good authority that the acting National Secretary, Victor Giadom, has been empowered by the FCT High Court in Abuja to act in that capacity. “In light of the above, we have no option than to reject the Uzodinma-led committee.”

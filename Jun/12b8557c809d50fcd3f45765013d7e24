Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez, has explained why his team failed to beat Celta Vigo in Saturday’s La Liga fixture. According to Suarez, Quique Setien’s side played well in the first half against Celta Vigo, but in the second half, it was different, adding that the host was more aggressive than the Catalan club. Barcelona played a 2-2 draw against Celta Vigo at the Municipal de Balaidos. Two goals from Luis Suarez and strikes from Fyodor Smolov and Lago Aspas ensured both sides shared a point each. “It was a vital match to fight for the title,” Suarez told La Liga TV after the match. “We had a good first half, creating chances, but in the second half, it was different, Celta was more aggressive. “It [the result] leaves a bitter taste, one of sadness and frustration because we have lost two points.” “For my part, I’m happy to help with both goals, but you are angry because things have to be corrected,” Suarez added. Barcelona will now take on Atletico Madrid on Tuesday in their next La Liga fixture.

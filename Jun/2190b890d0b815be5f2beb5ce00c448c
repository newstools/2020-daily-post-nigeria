Buying the Dip When any stock market takes a nosedive as we have seen with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, it doesn’t necessarily mean doom or gloom, especially for long term investors. Buying the dip is a basic investment principle that simply means ‘buy low and sell high’ but with a well-informed approach. It’s important you do your research on the company to know how their shares have performed over the years. Most companies have great shares that are profitable and are just affected by the temporary crisis but there is every likelihood that their stocks will rise in the future. History has taught us stock always grows People invest in stocks because over the last 100 years, stocks have tended to rise. Of course, there have been times where it crashes and periods where they have performed badly but overall, the Nigerian stock market has experienced steady growth as the economy has grown. While there have been a lot of ups and downs along the way, the market has generally moved upwards. And if you bought stocks and held them for 30, 40, or even 50 years, you would’ve made a lot of money. Many people invest in stocks simply because the odds are in their favour and that over time, the market will go up and earn them money. Invest in Stocks for Diversification When you purchase stocks, it allows you to diversify your money and this is a great way to create passive income for yourself. To diversify means the more ways you have to make money, the less you’re at risk from getting in financial trouble if any of your methods gets disrupted. For example, let’s say you have invested in Treasury Bills and Eurobonds and you have both a 9-5 and a side hustle; if you lose any of these sources of income, you would be able to depend on the other one because you have an option. This same principle applies to investing.

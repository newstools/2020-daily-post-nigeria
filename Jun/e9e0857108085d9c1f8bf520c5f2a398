The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has said that four states in Nigeria, Akwa Ibom, Benue, Cross River and Taraba are hosting over 57, 000 refugees from Cameroon. Speaking in Calabar on Friday to mark the World Refugee Day 2020 with a theme, ‘Everyone can make a difference, Every Action Counts’ the UNHCR Head of Field Christopher Mubanga regretted the influx of refugees in Nigeria. “Nigeria is presently hosting over 57, 000 Cameroonians refugees in Akwa Ibom, Benue, Cross River and Taraba. Cross River State alone hosts over 36, 000 Cameroonian refugees. This means, Cross River State alone hosts more than 63% of the refugees in Nigeria” he stated. He blamed the influx on the porous borders in Nigeria noting that “People are using illegal borders and routes to come into the country. We need to set up a monitoring system in our borders to detect foreigners. Our borders are not secured. He further said that our settlements (Camp) are congested, “This is a fact and it’s worrisome, it’s a concern, we are trying all we can to prevent an outbreak, our resources are not adequate, no more space for refugees in the settlements (Camp)” he said. Also speaking, the Director-General of State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) Princewill Ayim said that there are 162, 961 Nigeria refugees in Niger, 115, 653 Nigerians refugees in Cameroon and 13, 807 Nigerians refugees in Chard. He commended the UNHCR and other agencies for providing necessary support to cater for the refugees in Nigeria and other countries

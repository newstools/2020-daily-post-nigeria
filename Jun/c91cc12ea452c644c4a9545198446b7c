Leader of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has said Ondo people were against Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and would vote him out. He said this in a chat with newsmen at the weekend ahead of the October 20 governorship election. The cleric declared that Akeredolu runs a family government and may not even win the All Progressives Congress (APC) primary election slated for July. He said Akeredolu has “disappointed the good people of Ondo State.” “God doesn’t to sinners, but He listens to the godly person who does His will. You can say God is still with you when you must have turned a listening ear to their cries for help. “You increased tuition fees from N25, 000 to N150,000. Despite our pleadings, you instead threatened to shut down higher institutions across the state. “What happened to our moribund industries in the state? Oluwa Glass Company in Okitipupa, Ifon Ceramics, Araromi Ayesan Oil Palm, Alpha 3D factory in Ikare Akoko, Cocoa Processing Company, Ile Oluji, Cassava Processing Company, Ikoya and Fisheries in Akure are all begging for attention,” he said. The cleric noted that if the companies were functioning, youths won’t be “running to Lagos for jobs”. Giwa stated that Akeredolu has been running “a government of the father, wife, children and in-laws”. He added that the governor is contesting against Ondo people who have “made up their minds to send his government to the journey of no return.”

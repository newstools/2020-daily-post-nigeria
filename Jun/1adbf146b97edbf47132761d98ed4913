Internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Baissa East Primary school camp in Kurmi local government area of Taraba on Thursday said they were under threat of attack by suspected Ichen militiamen. Leader of the camp who pleaded anonymity told our correspondent on the phone that they have received several threats of attacks in the camp and have reported the same to relevant authorities. According to him, people in the camp were now living in palpable fear, following continued threats to attack the camp and called on the Taraba state government to save their lives. He said they were also facing food, shelter, water and medical challenges as the children were suffering from malaria and typhoid. Caretaker Chairman of Kurmi local government Council, Hon. Joseph Danladi confirmed the threat to attack the camp. Danladi said the state government was on top of the situation and would make an appropriate move soon. “Governor Darius Ishaku is aware of the development and measures are being put in place. “We don’t divulge security information on the phone, so I won’t speak more than this,” he said.

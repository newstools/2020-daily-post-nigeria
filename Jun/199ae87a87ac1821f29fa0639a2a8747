Michael Flor, a 70-year-old American has been charged $1.1 million by the hospital where he recovered from COVID-19. Flor nearly died of the Coronavirus disease after he spent 62 days at the hospital in the northwestern city, according to Seattle Times According to the report, nurses had at one point held up the phone so his wife and children could say goodbye after he came so close to death. But he recovered only to receive a 181-page bill totalling $1,122,501.04, Flor told the newspaper. The bill presented to the 70-year-old man includes: $9,736 per day for the intensive care room, nearly $409,000 for its transformation into a sterile room for 42 days, $82,000 for the use of a ventilator for 29 days, and nearly $100,000 for two days when his prognosis was life-threatening. However, the newspaper reports that Flor is covered by Medicare, a government insurance program for the elderly. But Flor said he feels “guilty” knowing that taxpayers will bear much of the cost of his heart-stopping hospital bills.” “It was a million bucks to save my life, and of course I’d say that’s money well-spent … But I also know I might be the only one saying that,” the Seatle Times quoted him as saying.

The embattled Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi, on Tuesday, accused Governor Oluwarotimi Akerdolu of plans to impeach him. The Deputy Governor accused his boss of giving out N10 million each to entice lawmakers in a bid to meet the requirement of two-third majority in order to carry out the impeachment on him. Ajayi have been having running battle with his boss, which culminated to the Deputy Governor’s decision to quit the APC before picking the membership card of the PDP. Shortly after his resignation from APC, the Deputy Governor disclosed that he will not resign from office stressing that the people who gave him the mandate did not ask him to resign as deputy governor. Meanwhile, additional security operatives were added to the existing security within the complex of the Ondo State House of Assembly. The security personnel were seen moving in and out of the assembly premises intermittently on Tuesday. According to the Deputy Governor in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Babatope Okeowo, the sudden appearance of policemen at the assembly complex was to prevent lawmakers opposed to the alleged impeachment plan from gaining access into the complex. Speaking on the allegation, the state Commissioner of Information, Donald Ojogo said, “This is the height of perfidy, another pernicious warp from an intellectually challenged and treacherous personality. Knowledge cannot be procured, but only be acquired. For anyone to aver that lawmakers have been financially induced is a gross display of emptiness. “It becomes more laughable when such comes from someone who had boasted about having majority members in the Assembly. Clearly, while the Executive led by Arakunrin Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu, SAN does not believe in inducement, it is left for our very reputable Legislative Arm to either confirm or debunk this spurious allegation.”

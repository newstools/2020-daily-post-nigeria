Charles Nzechi, the Candidate of the Labour Party(LP), for Ikwuano/Umuahia federal constituency in Abia State during the 2019 general election, and five thousand of his supporters, have dumped the party for the All Progressives Congress,(APC). This is coming barely a few weeks after a two-term Commissioner of Industry, Science and Technology, Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh and the immediate Past lawmaker that represented Arochukwu constituency in the Abia State House of Assembly, Hon. Luke Okara Onyeani, left their parties for the governing APC. Speaking while officially declaring for the APC in a short event held in Umuahia, on Friday, Nzechi disclosed that he has documented his membership at his Isingwu ward in Umuahia North local government area of Abia state. However, Nzechiâ€™s defection to All Progressives Congress, APC, was formalised at a ceremony held at the home of one of the ward leaders of APC in Isingwu, Chibuike Ude Agomuo of Amafor Ihungwu, Umuahia North Local Government Area of the state. DAILY POST learned that Abia State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress,(APC), has continued to witness the influx of politicians from other political parties, especially with the release of senator Orji Uzor Kalu, the Chief Whip of the Nigeria Senate from prison.

The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has explained why schools in the state remain closed. Sanwo-Olu, speaking at a press briefing at the State House in Marina, admitted that the guidelines for reopening schools were not ready. The Governor had promised two weeks ago, that the guidelines would be made public. He said schools cannot be allowed to reopen with the increasing cases of COVID-19 in the state. Sanwo-Olu, however, said his government was finalising the protocols to reopen basic and secondary schools, noting that meetings were currently being held with stakeholders. “Regarding the educational sector, I did mention that by now, we will be expressing a full guideline. Those guidelines are not ready yet because of the engagements we are having with the various stakeholders in that sector. But we will need to continue to encourage the online learning that we have. “That has started extensively with our higher institutions. We are encouraging other private sectors as well to use as much online capability as a form of intervention in the educational sector until the statistics that we have subsided and we are at a stage that all of these schools can reopen again,” Sanwo-Olu said.

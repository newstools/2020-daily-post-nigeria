Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has shared details of his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari. Both men met behind closed doors on Sunday at the State House in Abuja. Buhari and Lawan discussed the current state of security in the country, the crisis currently engulfing the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and other topics. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Lawan said “You know that the country is facing many serious and deep security challenges and I have come to meet with Mr President to discuss with him what we have discussed in the senate previously that we should do whatever it will take to improve the security situation in the country. The Senate President also called for more resources to be provided for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Police and Immigration to make more recruitments. On the COVID-19 pandemic, he added: “We provided for N500 billion worth of intervention for the COVID-19 in the revised budget and various agencies, the CBN, NNPC and the IOCs provided for palliatives and some kind of intervention for the COVID challenge.” Earlier this week, Buhari warned security chiefs that he will no longer accept excuses.

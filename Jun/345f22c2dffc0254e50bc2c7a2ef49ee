Senator Dino Melaye, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the November 16, 2019, Kogi-West senatorial election, has reacted to the National Assembly Election Petition Tribunal judgment dismissing his petition against the outcome of the Kogi West Senatorial District rerun election. The Tribunal on Wednesday upheld the election of Senator Smart Adeyemi and dismissed Melaye’s petition seeking for him to be declared the winner of the election. A three-man panel of judges in a unanimous ruling said Melaye and the PDP failed to validate their claims in the petition to warrant granting their appeal. Reacting, Meleya, in a tweet on his official Twitter handle, said he was disappointed by the Judgment. He explained that he never expected justices at the tribunal, adding that he will be appealing the Judgment. The 46-year-old politician, however, called on his supporters to stay away from violence and remain law-abiding. Melaye said in a video on Twitter with a caption: “I never expected Justice at this level. But we shall laugh last.” See video https://twitter.com/i/status/1270702189007249410

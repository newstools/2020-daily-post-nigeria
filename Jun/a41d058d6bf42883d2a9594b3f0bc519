He said the inter-state offenders, who divided themselves into groups, were intercepted inside the different commuter bus, with multifarious machetes, cutlasses, shovels and assorted charms. While on interrogations, Comrade Amitolu said the intruders claimed to be labourers at mining sites in Osun, but could not explain why they came with weapons and assorted charms and were trying to enter into the state illegally. He said, “The drivers of the commuter buses also claimed that they were only conveying the ”illegal travelers” from Ibadan, Oyo State capital to Osogbo, in Osun; after they had alighted from trucks coming from the North. “We thereafter sent them back to where they came from, to prevent transmission of COVID-19.” He added.

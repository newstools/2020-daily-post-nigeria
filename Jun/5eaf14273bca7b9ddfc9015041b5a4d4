The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State risks exclusion from the forthcoming governorship election, DAILY POST has learnt. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had scheduled October 10, 2020, for the exercise. Last week, the APC notified INEC that it fixed July 20, 2020, for its primary election. The ruling party invited the commission to monitor. But the letter with Ref. No. APC/NHDQ/INEC/19/020/013 was only signed by the Acting National Secretary, Waziri Bulama. INEC has now warned the APC that the letter violates the provision of Article 4.4 of the Commission’s Regulations and Guidelines for the Conduct of Party Primaries. The section requires that such notices must be jointly signed by party’s National Chairman and National Secretary. The electoral body thus rejected the Bulama’s letter and advised the party to do the needful. INEC memo to the APC was signed by the Secretary to the Commission, Mrs Rose Oriaran-Anthony. The development may affect the APC. By the provision of Section 85 (1) of the Electoral Act, parties are required to give INEC 21 days notice for the conduct of their primaries for governorship elections. INEC timetable released on February 6, 2020, shows that party primaries for the Ondo election starts on July 2 and ends on July 25, 2020. The last day for submission of candidates’ is July 28, 2020. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-809084" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/INEC-letter-to-APC.jpg" alt="" width="722" height="1010" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/INEC-letter-to-APC.jpg 722w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/INEC-letter-to-APC-214x300.jpg 214w" sizes="(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px">

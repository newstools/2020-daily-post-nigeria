Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is lining up Paul Pogba to play as his No 10, in a bid to fit him alongside Bruno Fernandes, the UK Sun reports. Pogba has returned to full fitness following an ankle injury and is fit for the Premier League restart, when they travel to Tottenham Hotspur on June 19. Solskjaer is hoping the Frenchman can strike up a formidable partnership with Fernandes. The Norwegian will be relying on his two stars, to fire United to a Champions League spot, with Solskjaer’s men currently in fifth place, three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Solskjaer has been working on a system where he can play Pogba and Fernandes together and has decided on deploying the World Cup winner in a new attacking midfield role. Pogba has already been prepped to play in that role, having featured in behind the main striker during last Saturday’s intra-squad friendly game at Old Trafford.

The Police Command in Kaduna State has said that it arrested one Umar Audi, 35, who allegedly kidnapped a 15-year-old girl, NAN reports. Audu who was charged with one count of child stealing was arraigned before a Chief Magistrates’ Court in Kafanchan, Kaduna State, on Wednesday. The presiding judge, Abdulaziz Ibrahim, however, did not take the plea of the accused due to lack of jurisdiction to entertain the matter, ordering that he be remanded in a correctional facility, pending legal advice. The state’s counsel from the Ministry of Justice, Mathias Joseph, told the court that the complainant reported the matter in the Salama Sexual Assault Referral Centre, Kafanchan and it was forwarded to Civil Defence for investigation. Joseph said that the complainant, who resides in Jagindi Tasha, Kaduna State, alleged that Audi sought his 15-year-old daughter’s hand in marriage. The prosecutor noted that Audi’s romantic overtures were rebuffed by the father and the village chief, who warned him to stay away from the girl. However, he defied their warnings and kidnapped the girl to an unknown destination. According to him, the offense was contrary to the provisions of Section 210 of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law, 2017. The judge adjourned the case until July 8, ordering that the case file be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecution for legal advice.

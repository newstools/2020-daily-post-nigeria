The Lagos State Police Command has released details of the alleged gruesome murder-suicide over the paternity of a child. The spokesman, Bala Elkana, in a statement, announced that the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, has ordered an investigation. It said that on Sunday, at about 4:00pm, Ilasan Police Station received information that a couple – Olamide Alli, female (25) and Chris Ndukwe, male (39) – were found dead in the man’s residence at Road 5, House 16a, Victory Point Estate in Ilasan, Lekki area. The team of homicide detectives deployed to the scene found the woman in the pool of her blood with deep cuts on her head, while the man’s mouth was foaming with whitish substance. Chris was said to have removed Olamide’s hair with plier, stabbed her to death with a kitchen knife and thereafter drank poisonous substances. “Two blood-stained kitchen knives, two empty bottles of the poisonous substances, three empty cans of energy drink and a plier were recovered from the scene,” the Police disclosed. The statement said the couple had been in a relationship for over seven years, though not married, but have two boys, ages 7 and 3. The relationship was described as complicated, as the couple were on and off over the years. While the man lives in Victory Point Estate Ilasan, the woman lives in Ogba. The Police revealed that Olamide visited the man alongside her 22-year-old sister, a night before the incident, on his invitation. “Her sister was the first to have noticed that the couple were dead and raised the alarm”, Elkana noted. In her statement, the lady recalled that she was woken up by a loud music from the room where the corpses were found, as herself and the kids slept in a different room. It is not yet clear what might have triggered the murder, the police said, adding that the corpses were removed and deposited in a mortuary for autopsy.

The Adamawa State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), has suspended its Secretary, Mr. Anthony Elishama, over alleged mismanagement of N1,350,000. The suspension is to last three months, within which time he is to refund the money. The suspension order was contained in a statement signed by the state Chairman of CAN, Bishop Stephen Mamza, who asked Anthony Elishama to return all official properties to the CAN State Secretariat in Yola immediately. In the statement obtained Saturday evening by DAILY POST, Mamza explained that Elishama’s suspension was decided during the state executive meeting of the association on Thursday. According to the CAN chairman, “Mr. Anthony Elishama’s suspension is as a result of mismanaging of funds belonging to the Nigerian Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) to the tune of N1.350 million.” He said the state executive of CAN expressed disappointment by the secretary’s action, adding that CAN leadership had zero tolerance to any type of financial indiscipline. He said that the secretary’s suspension would take effect from June 20, 2020, pending the state executive committee’s final decision on the issue.

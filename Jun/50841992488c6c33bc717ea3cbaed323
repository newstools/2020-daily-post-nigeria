Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has singled out winger, Christian Pulisic for praise following the Blues’ away Premier League 2-1 victory against Aston Villa on Sunday. Lampard said Pulisic was hungry during the encounter against the host, adding that the 21-year-old American international’s ability to always arrive in the box was a big thing. Lampard’s men defeated Aston Villa at the Villa Park Stadium, thanks to two goals from Pulisic and Olivier Giroud in the second half. Speaking on Pulisic’s performance against Aston Villa, Lampard was quoted by Goal as telling reporters after the game: “He was hungry. “I know that, and I felt for him. He has trained well. “The ability to arrive in the box is a big thing. “It’s a difference between being a very good player on the flank and a top-class player.” Pulisic will now hope to continue his impressive display for Chelsea when they host Manchester City in their next Premier League fixture on Thursday.

A former chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), John Oyegun, has claimed the party is becoming a threat to the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari and his government. Oyegun stated this in reaction to the leadership crisis within the APC, after a Court of Appeal upheld the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole as National Chairman of the ruling party. Ex-Governor of Oyo state, Abiola Ajimobi, was declared Acting Chairman by the National Working Committee (NWC), but the National Secretary, Victor Giadom, has insisted he is in charge of the ruling party. In a statement on Saturday, Oyegun said “Our own political party, the APC, is fast becoming the single most dangerous threat to the legacy of our government and our president. “In the last few months we have watched how the party has brazenly subverted its own principles of internal democracy and flagrant violation of every rule of decent political engagement in a manner that makes everyone associated with its promise of change liable to be accused of either hypocrisy or apostasy.” He also urged the APC to remember its victory in the 2015 presidential election and the peaceful transfer of power. According to Oyegun, that inspired other African nations, who have seen made more progress than Nigeria.

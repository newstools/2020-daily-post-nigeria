The Arthur Obiorah-led Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Wing has lauded the courage and boldness of former Governor of old Anambra State Chief Jim Nwobodo over his recent stand on Igbos succeeding President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Former Governor of old Anambra State, Jim Nwobodo, had on Monday, said a Nigerian President of Igbo extraction in 2023 was non-negotiable. DAILY POST reports that Nwobodo spoke in his Amaechi country home when a chieftaincy title was bestowed on him by the Amurri Ancient Kingdom. Nwobodo received the title from Dr. Ben Nwoye, the Enugu State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and the crown Prince of Amurri kingdom, on behalf of the community. However, in a statement issued on Wednesday, Ohanaeze youths also cautioned the President of Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, Alhaji Yerima Shettima, on some of his alleged caustic remarks which threaten the peace and unity of the nation. The Igbo youth organization reminded Shettima that it is not his duty to tell Ndigbo who their political leaders are or should be, he recalled that Ndigbo had related well with the north and would not shy away from that in future despite the utterances of Shettima and cohorts ‘who lack a sense of history’. Ohanaeze lauded the patriotism of some northern leaders who have insisted on political Justice and equity in 2023 and power shift to Igbo land. On the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, Ohanaeze youths stated that it had toured all borders of Igbo states to ensure compliance with the COVID-19 lockdown.

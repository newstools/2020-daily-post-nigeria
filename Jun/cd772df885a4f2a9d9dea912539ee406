The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday, screened Edo Governor Godwin Obaseki.
The party’s primary election scheduled to hold on Thursday, June 25. Governor Obaseki was screened at the party’s headquarters in Abuja. After he was questioned by the Kingsley Chinda-led screening committee, Obaseki commended the party for the exercise. Expressing optimism that he would secure the PDP ticket he said that the “screening exercise was fair and professional; I saw objectivity in it.” Obaseki noted he was not a divisive candidate, adding that he was “speaking with all the aspirants. My hope and purpose for the PDP is to have a united and very strong party.” He said party primary should not be divisive “because we, as a party, are focused on the same objective, but because we are individuals, our approaches may be different”. The governor did there are common grounds, common interests “and I am very hopeful that I will get it even as there are quite a number of delegates for the exercise,” he said. On credentials, Obaseki said he presented his certificates. “My secondary school, higher school, university and my National Youth Service certificate, so that they can look at them and see if there are inconsistencies.” Asked if he still enjoyed the sympathy of All Progressives Congress (APC) governors, Obaseki said he enjoyed national support, not just support from his colleagues from the APC. The governor said there are elder statesmen “who are apolitical; there are traditional rulers; I have people from different spectrums of the society who come around on solidarity with me”. Obaseki stressed that Nigerians are generally fair-minded people. He noted that they do not accept injustice, adding that “From what I have seen over the past several weeks and months, the support is just across the board. It is not just from APC governors alone.”

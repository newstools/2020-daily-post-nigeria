Bayern Munich have been crowned Bundesliga champions for the eighth consecutive year. Robert Lewandowski netted his 31st league goal of the season, as they beat relegation-threatened Werder Bremen 1-0 at the Weser Stadium on Tuesday. Hansi Flickâ€™s men were reduced to 10 men in the closing stages, after Alphonso Davies saw red in the 79th minute. But the visitors held on to ensure they won their 22nd game in the last 23 matches in all competitions. Bremen remain 17th, level on points with Dusseldorf, who currently occupy the relegation play-off spot but now with a game in hand over their rivals.

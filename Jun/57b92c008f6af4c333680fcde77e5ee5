Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, would be willing to sell N’Golo Kante, in order to raise money to complete other deals, the UK Times reports. The Blues have already sealed moves for Hakim Ziyech from Ajax and Timo Werner from RB Leipzig ahead of next season. However, Lampard would have to sacrifice some members of his current squad, if he wants to bring in more new faces. Kante arrived at Stamford Bridge in 2016 from Leicester City and has become of the key players at the club. However, his future is now in doubt, with Chelsea very keen on signing Kai Havertz from Bayer Leverkusen. Others at risk include Marcos Alonso, Baba Rahman, Kurt Zouma, Andreas Christensen, Tiemoue Bakayoko and Michy Batshuayi. Havertz will cost around £75m, but is believed to favour a switch to Real Madrid.

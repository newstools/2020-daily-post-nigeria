The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it received with shock the passing of the Senator representing Lagos East, Bayo Osinowo. The lawmaker died on Monday in Lagos. In a statement, APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Oniru, expressed sadness about the demise. The party said it joined other Nigerians, the National Assembly and the people of Lagos State to mourn the passage of the lawmaker. APC said Osinowo “contributed immensely to the development of Lagos State as a lawmaker in the House of Assembly and Nigeria as a Senator.” It noted that though his tenure in the Senate was brief, “our great party appreciates the loyalty of Senator Osinowo to the cause of the APC-led government.” The party prayed that Almighty God grants the deceased peaceful and eternal rest. Fondly called “Pepperito” by friends and associates, Osinowo was a four-term member of the Lagos House of Assembly, where he represented Kosofe constituency. In the 9th Senate, he chaired the Senate Committee on Commerce, Industries and Investment, and member of other standing committees.

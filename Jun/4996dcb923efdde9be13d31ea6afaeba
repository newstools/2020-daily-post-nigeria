Edo state Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has said the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, is afraid of educated people because “he did not go to school”. Obaseki stated this while speaking with State House correspondents on Tuesday. The governor, who has been at loggerheads with Oshiomhole, has dumped APC after being disqualified from the party’s primary election. “He (Oshiomhole) has not provided a level playing ground even in the selection process, the disqualification process: what is the basis for disqualifying someone like Chris Ogiemwonyi? “You are afraid of people who are educated because you didn’t go to school. “You are afraid of people who have something to offer because all he knows how to offer is brigandage, crisis,” Obaseki said. Obaseki is widely expected to join the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), ahead of the Edo state governorship elections in September.

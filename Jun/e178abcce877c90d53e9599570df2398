Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has expressed his optimism that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will remain at the club. However, Arteta feels the Gunners have a “responsibility to make him feel this is the right next step in his career.” In an interview over the weekend, Aubameyang revealed he is yet to get a new contract offer from the club, with his current deal expiring next summer. The Gabon striker has been consistently linked with several clubs like Barcelona, Real Madrid and Inter Milan. “I think it’s our responsibility to make him feel that this is the right next step in his career. In order to do that he needs to feel valued, I think he needs to feel that he belongs to us and we want him. “And then he really needs to believe we can take this club forward in the way we want to do and he’s going to be a key player to do that,” Arteta said in a prematch news conference held via Zoom on Monday.

The Cross River State Government’s Accountant General, Joe Adie, has decried the non-payment of salaries of local government workers in the state. Speaking to DAILY POST via phone in Calabar, Cross River, the Accountant General lamented the situation and blamed it on the Account Clarks in the local government councils. He said that if the state Governor, Prof Ben Ayade was aware that workers’ salaries in the local government areas had not been paid, he will be mad with those responsible for the non-payment of the salaries. “If Governor is aware that local government workers are not paid their May salaries, he will be mad with them as their counterparts in the state have been paid since.” The Accountant General pointed out that the delay was not caused by his office, explaining that his office was waiting for local government workers to bring in their vouchers and regretting that the vouchers for the month of May have not been brought to his office. “We are waiting for the local government councils to bring their vouchers to us; we cannot go to ask them. They are supposed to prepare it before today and bring them to us but they have not done so. “It’s not our duty to ask them. My office is waiting for them. “If they bring the vouchers now, I will ask them to sit at one corner and make sure that they do the needful and I get everything done and within 30 minutes, I am waiting for them,” he stated.

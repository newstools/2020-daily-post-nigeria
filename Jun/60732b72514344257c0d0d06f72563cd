President Muhammadu Buhari has joined Muslims across the nation to mourn a leading cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Olayiwola Kamaldeen. He passed on in Ilorin, Kwara State on Friday. Kamaldeen was until his death, the Khalifah Al-Adaby of Ansarul Islam Society of Nigeria. In a statement on Saturday by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu, Buhari described his demise as “a loss to the Emir of Ilorin, the Ilorin Community, Kwara State, Nigeria and the entire Muslim Community.” The president said the deceased was a front line Islamic jurist and an established technocrat who rose to the position of Permanent Secretary in government and Khalifah in the service of the Islamic faith. The Nigerian leader prayed to Allah to forgive the sheikh’s shortcomings, accept his return and repose his soul in Jannatul Firdaus.

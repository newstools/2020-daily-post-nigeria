The Oba of Benin, Omo N’Oba Nedo Uku Akpolokpolo Oba Ewuare II, has stated his position on political developments in Edo State. In a statement released on Thursday and signed by the Secretary to the Benin Traditional Council, Frank Irabor, the monarch kicked against godfatherism and imposition of candidates. The Oba also denied that he has ever asked any of the aspirants in the upcoming elections to step down for another. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primary will hold on June 23, a day after the All Progressives Congress (APC) conducts theirs. According to the statement: “HRM has said times without number that the palace of the Oba of Benin does not get involved in partisan politics. “The Omo N’Oba strongly advises that in order to eschew recurrent socio-political conflict that seems to constantly ravish the state, making Edo people a laughing stock to the rest of the country on how politicians manage the affairs of Edo people, our Edo political actors must eradicate the twin evil of political vices of godfatherism and consensus candidacy. The two practices seem antithetical to the very fundamental basis of democracy.” “Let everybody take note that the palace is very weary of imposition of candidates, when only certain individuals want, but the majority of the people do not want. ‘Ghana must go’ politics should end in the state. Politicians should stop cashing in on the poor masses and exploiting them for their votes,” it added.

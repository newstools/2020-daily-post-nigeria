Aisha Buhari, the First Lady of Nigeria has called on the Inspector-General of Police, IGP, to release her staff still in their custody in order not to expose them to the danger of coronavirus. She also called for stricter measures in the implementation of COVID-19 guidelines. Her comment follows the increasing rate of confirmed cases recorded in Nigeria in the past few days. The First Lady also urged the police to put those who disobey the COVID-19 restriction to undergo 14 days of mandatory isolation. On Thursday, the Nigeria Center for Disease Control, NCDC, recorded 661 COVID-19 cases, the highest so far since the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus. Her tweet read: “That Covid-19 is real and still very much around in our nation is not in doubt. Consequently, I call on all relevant Government Agencies to enforce the Quarantine Act signed by Mr. President and ensure no one is found violating this law and the NCDC guidelines especially on interstate travel without the necessary exemptions for the movement of essentials. “Anyone who does that should at the very least be made to undergo 14-day mandatory isolation no matter who the person is, no one should be above the law and the Police Command will do well to remember that. “Finally, I call on the IGP to release my assigned staff who are still in the custody of the Police in order to avoid putting their lives in danger or exposure to Covid-19 while in their custody.”

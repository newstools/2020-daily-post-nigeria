As we speak, I am a proud owner a 4-bedroom bungalow in Abuja, Nigeria. “Let me shock you, before now, twice my relatives squandered the house money I sent home, but today I bought and supervised my building from here at T Pumpy Estate.” Responding, T Pumpy MD/CEO, Akintayo Adaralegbe said the window is still open to anyone willing to become a landlord in Abuja. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-807762 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.46-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="581" height="581" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.46-PM.jpeg 581w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.46-PM-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.46-PM-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.46-PM-80x80.jpeg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px">  He said the company is still giving out its Airport Road land at N1.750m per plot. Mr. Adaralegbe explained the reason behind the slash in price of its land from N3.5m to N1.75m, offering 50 per cent discount by the company. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-807759 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.19.57-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="360" height="360" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.19.57-PM.jpeg 360w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.19.57-PM-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.19.57-PM-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.19.57-PM-80x80.jpeg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"> According to him, the promo was done to encourage Nigerians to own their houses due to the effect of Coronavirus pandemic on the livelihoods of many Nigerians and also to complement government’s national housing plan considering the effects covid 19 pandemics on the economy. He noted that although T Pumpy has 22 housing estates and properties scattered across Kyami, Kasana, Kuje, Lugbe, Gwagwalada and other places in the nation’s capital, however, the ongoing promo is only exclusive to their property along the Airport Road. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-807760 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.24-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="581" height="581" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.24-PM.jpeg 581w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.24-PM-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.24-PM-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.24-PM-80x80.jpeg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 581px) 100vw, 581px"> Speaking on the development, the CEO on Friday said the offer would end on June 30. In his words, “I have said this several times that one of my greatest passions is to see that every Nigerian own a house of his or her own. It is not all about business but a sincerity purpose to roofs over the heads of many Nigerians as much as I can assist.  He said, “Imagine owning a standard 600sqm plot of a duplex, a penthouse or a bungalow for as low N1.75m. We are doing this because of the economic effects of the coronavirus on the people. “Of course you known it is every man’s dream to own a house and that is why T Pumpy Concept Limited wants to make sure to actualize that dream for them. “The market worth of the land is N3.5m but we are giving it out at this price just to encourage Nigerians at this critical time. Our lands are verifiable and authentic; they are government-approved. This promo will end on June 30. “We sell and develop all types of estate lands for residential, educational, commercial and recreational purposes. There are lands for bungalows, penthouses, duplexes, with corresponding land sizes and amount. Crèches/nursery school plots are also available. “Our expertise in building to the highest quality standards is evident throughout our complete line of estates. Our Estates are constructed in a factory environment and our building materials are never exposed to the elements and every aspect of the building process is closely monitored to ensure high-quality standards. “We also undertake feasibility and viability studies of real estate development projects. They are government-approved estate plots suitable for 4 or 5 bedroom duplex, 4 or 5 bedroom penthouse and 3 bedroom bungalow. “The land and building plans are government-approved, authentic and highly verifiable.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-807761 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.05-PM.jpeg" alt="" width="480" height="480" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.05-PM.jpeg 480w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.05-PM-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.05-PM-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/WhatsApp-Image-2020-05-10-at-5.20.05-PM-80x80.jpeg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px"> T.

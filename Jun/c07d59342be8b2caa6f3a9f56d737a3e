The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Friday said the Peoples Democratic Party’s energy will help him take the state to the next level. Obaseki made the remark shortly after he picked up his membership form at the party’s Secretariat in Benin City, the state capital. Addressing supporters and party members, the governor promised to provide leadership that would ensure the party emerges winner of the forthcoming governorship election in the state. He said: “I am prepared to provide leadership that will lead this party to victory. I am prepared to provide leadership that will not only put PDP into office in Edo State but as a ruling party in Edo State, we will make sure that the level of progress, growth and participation in the political system and our people is unrivalled in this country. “I am very happy to be here. The reception I have received since I drove in here has been ecstatic. The energy I see in this party is the kind of energy I require to take Edo to the level we should go to next.” Following his protracted disagreement with Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Obaseki had a few days ago dumped the party for the PDP.

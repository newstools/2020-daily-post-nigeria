With the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, schools across major cities in the country have
closed down indefinitely, leaving millions of students without access to education. The
inaccessibility to academic activities for such a long time could be unhealthy to the
educational development of an individual. Though the days are starting to feel the same, students are losing valuable time to the global
crisis. To tackle the learning gap created by the pandemic, FirstBank have launched an e-
learning initiative in collaboration with partners, Robert & John, IBM and Curious Learning, to
foster the continuous learning in its commitment to drive 1 million students in Nigeria
through elearning, from primary, secondary and selected tertiary levels, during and after the
COVID-19 pandemic.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-809714" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/72946DA5-7B3C-40DF-B06F-3B1F6813652E.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1500" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/72946DA5-7B3C-40DF-B06F-3B1F6813652E.png 1500w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/72946DA5-7B3C-40DF-B06F-3B1F6813652E-300x300.png 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/72946DA5-7B3C-40DF-B06F-3B1F6813652E-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/72946DA5-7B3C-40DF-B06F-3B1F6813652E-150x150.png 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/72946DA5-7B3C-40DF-B06F-3B1F6813652E-80x80.png 80w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"> The partnership with Robert & John, offers Roducate, an e-learning solution with

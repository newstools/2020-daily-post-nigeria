The operatives of the anti-kidnap unit of the Imo State Police Command, Owerri, has arrested an alleged kidnap kingpin, Sampson Okorafor, for killing two other gang leaders during an exchange of gunfire. DAILY POST reports that the police squad was led to the onslaught by CSP Linus Nwaiwu. The incident, according to reports, took place on Monday at Emeabiam in Owerri West LGA of Imo State. Their arrest followed the kidnapping of one Mr. Chijioke Amadi, aged, 42 who hails from Ibeku Okwuato in Aboh Mbaise LGA, but resident in Naze, Owerri West. Reports have it that the force received a call that four armed-men with an ash coloured Volkswagen car allegedly kidnapped a businessman. They immediately mobilized and stormed the kidnappers hideout at Umuokpo Emebiam in Owerri West LGA where the bandits, on sighting them, opened fire on them. While two gang leaders, Sunday Emmanuel from Abia State and Ochendo from Ebonyi State were gunned down by the police, Chijioke from Emeabiam narrowly escaped. However, Sampson Okorafor from the same Abia State was arrested. Items recovered from them were 2-AK47 rifles, 90 rounds of live ammunition and a Volkswagen car. However, the victim was rescued and reunited with his family. The State Police Public Relation Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu said the successful operation followed the continued support of the new Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede and the Imo government.

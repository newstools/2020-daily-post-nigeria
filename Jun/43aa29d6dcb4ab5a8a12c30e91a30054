The All Progressives Congress (APC) Vice-Chairman, South-South, Prince Hilliard Eta, has taken over as the ruling party’s Acting National Chairman. There has been confusion in the party following the Appeal Court decision that upheld the suspension of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole as the party’s National Chairman on Tuesday. Eta took over as the Acting National Chairman, and appointed Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma as the Edo Primary Election Chairman. The Eta-led National Working Committee also declared as vacant the office of the Deputy National Secretary of the party, which was occupied by Chief Victor Giadom. Recall that Giadom earlier today declared himself the Acting Chairman of the party. However, following an emergency meeting on Wednesday, the National Working Committee (NWC) of the APC clarified the apparent confusion regarding the new leadership of the party. The NWC of the APC in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, affirmed former Oyo State Governor, Abiola Ajimobi as the party’s authentic Acting National Chairman. The party, however, explained that due to Ajimobi’s unavoidable absence, “the NWC unanimously appointed the party’s National Vice-Chairman (South-South), Prince Hilliard Etta to act”. He said Etta’s replacement of Ajimobi is “backed by the Party’s constitution which empowers the NWC to appoint one of its members in an acting capacity and stipulates that the acting National chairman must be from the zone of the National Chairman”.

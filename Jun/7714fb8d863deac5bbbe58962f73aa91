It is over two months since the deadly coronavirus has kept Nigerians, like other people around the world, weary of public places. The death toll keeps increasing although successes are being recorded in the area of recovery. Nigerians have been using other means to get themselves busy and keeping up with their official and unofficial activities. Platforms like Instagram, Zoom, YouTube and other video sharing media have been widely used in this development but perhaps one major hitherto overlooked platform is now the toast of many, Vskit. Fun revellers, entertainers and short video makers now use Vskit, the emerging tailor-made app for Africans with regards to skit-making. Recently, big names on Instagram, including celebrity music acts have been seen flaunting the use of Vskit. From Mr Macaroni to BRed, Taaooma, Iyanya, Small Doctor, Ikorodu Bois, and many other talents, Vskit is sure a platform for the flourishing minds.  Artistes are also taking advantage of the video-sharing app to promote new and old musical deliveries while the comic acts are strategically pushing out content to the excitement of their followers. The app’s ease at sharing content on other digital platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have also kept users entangled to it as the world continues to battle the virus. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-801131 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vs2.png" alt="" width="236" height="512" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vs2.png 236w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vs2-138x300.png 138w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px"> Another uniqueness for the fans, followers of celebrities and other regular users of Vskit are the numerous contests with mouthwatering prizes. The #CamonBeautyMode will give out 15 phones and 1 million naira to the grand prize winner. The TECNO and Vskit partnership has seen many users express themselves in excitement. #CamonBeautyMode has above 43,018,900 views with an outstanding audience reach of 3,013,280 <img class="aligncenter wp-image-801130 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vs3.jpg" alt="" width="236" height="512" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vs3.jpg 236w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vs3-138x300.jpg 138w" sizes="(max-width: 236px) 100vw, 236px"> Also very mind blowing was the live launch of the Infinix Note 7 which took place recently. Vskit wowed Nigerians as the app witnessed a rave of visits from people who are interested in attending the launch and looking to share the experience with attendees like Davido, Ini Edo, Nancy Isime, Patoranking and MC Lively. A product launch being held in an offline location, definitely won’t take as much capacity as seen on Vskit online figures a few days ago. This, without a doubt, is a digital solution for brands during and after the pandemic. Like other video sharing and digital platforms which include Triller and YouTube, Vskit has been a life saver for many in this challenging CoronaTimes.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) says there is no zoning arrangement for the planned national convention. This was contained in a statement on Tuesday by Yekini Nabena, Deputy National Publicity Secretary. It urged party members, supporters, stakeholders and indeed the public to disregard any claim of zoning. Nabena said the first meeting of the Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee (CEONCPC) was held at the national secretariat on Monday. He affirmed that members did not discuss zoning of offices at the inaugural parley. “If and when a zoning arrangement is made for the planned National Convention, it will be officially communicated and publicised”, he added. The meeting was attended by all thirteen members. They are Governor Mala Buni – Chairman, Governor Isiaka Oyetola, Governor Sani Bello, Ken Nnamani, Abubakar Yusuf, Akinyemi Olaide, Stella Oketete, James Lulu, David Lyon, Abba Ali, Tahir Mamman, Ismail Ahmed and John Udoedeghe – Secretary.

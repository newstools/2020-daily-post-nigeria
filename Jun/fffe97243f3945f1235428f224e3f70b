The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Buratai, has charged senior military officers and operational commanders to see to the end insecurity across the country. Buratai met with the senior officers and operational commanders on Tuesday, in Abuja. Col. Sagir Musa, the Acting Director, Army Public Relations, disclosed the outcome of the meeting to newsmen in Abuja. He quoted Buratai as saying that the meeting became imperative as efforts are being made to combat Boko Haram insurgency, North West banditry and the myriad of other security challenges. According to him, the meeting was a wakeup call for commanders, officers and men to redouble their efforts and ensure that all security threats in the country were effectively checkmated. He directed all officers and men to ensure that the charge recently made by the Commander in Chief, President Muhammadu Buhari on security challenges across the country were fully followed. He said: “The criminals and their collaborators and sponsors must be exposed, flushed out and destroyed. “Already the Nigerian Army has commenced major reorganisation of her operations for optimal performance and all Commanders must lead the charge by being out in the field to effectively oversee the operations.” The army chief said there was no time for complacency or excuses, warning that there would be no tolerance for shortcomings or failures in the effort to immediately reverse the security situation.

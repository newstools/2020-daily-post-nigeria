As sectors of Nigerian economy gradually reopen, the federal government has reacted to plans to resume football and sporting activities. Boss Mustapha, the chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on Friday disclosed that the Federal Government is not interested in resumption of the Nigerian football league since gathering of over 20 people is still prohibited. The Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) has been suspended since March due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Mustapha says the reopening of sporting activities will have to be delayed till a later time. “I’m not sure we are excited about opening sporting activities in Nigeria especially football which attracts large crowds. According to him, there would be no excitement if soccer is allowed to return to an empty stadium. “A lot of European countries where football have resumed are big businesses and they are doing it carefully and gradually. “We will get there but not now, we are only concerned with the few activities allowed to reopen this phase,” Mustapha added. He, however, assured that the COVID-19 team will continue to review the situation, and know what next to do based on data, science and environment.

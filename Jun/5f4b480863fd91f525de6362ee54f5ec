The leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in South Africa Chapter has insisted that its chairman, Dr. Olusola Taiye Abe, is dead. NAN reports that a statement jointly signed by Chuks Okoye, Chairman, Board of Trustees, and its Public Relations Officer, Olusegun Badmus, described a statement denying the death of its chairman as a “misrepresentation”. It said before the demise of Abe, he successfully “led our organization rising from the position of vice chairman to the Late Chairman, Festus Ogbeide, to become the substantive chairman in 2017”. They noted that official records abound in South Africa and at the APC national headquarters in Abuja to validate this. The chapter further recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari sent his condolence through his media aide, Femi Adesina. Buhari, in his eulogy, recounted many meetings with the departed on visits to South Africa. “Dr Abe looked forward to a Nigeria that would take its rightful place among the comity of nations, and passionately believed in a resurgent country we could all be proud of,” he said.

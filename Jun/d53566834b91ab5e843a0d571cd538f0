They killed Dikko Usman, the Sarkin Fulanin Fafu and Head of Mazoji village in Matazu Local Government Area. PRNigeria reports that no fewer than 8 people were killed, while 10 others sustained injuries, with many missing. Spokesperson of the Police Command in Katsina, Gambo Isah, said a statement on the incident would be released. The attack occurred three days after dozens of people were killed in Faskari. Also recently, Atiku Maidabino, the district head of Yantumaki in Danmusa Local Government Area, was murdered in his palace. Meanwhile, Nigerian troops have repelled Boko Haram attempted invasion of Monguno in Borno State. A military source said the insurgents stormed the town Saturday afternoon. Gunshots rented the air as they attempted to overrun the town. However, soldiers foiled the offensive with the help of aerial intervention. The source said while the ground troops engaged the terrorists, a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) jet destroyed vehicles conveying them. “The terrorists suffered heavy casualties. Jets bombarded eight vehicles carrying them”, he added.

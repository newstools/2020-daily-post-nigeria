Women numbering about 100 have staged a protest on alleged burning of suspected witches and wizards in Calabar, Cross River State capital. The protesters, who wore black attires, walked round major streets with placards carrying various inscriptions such as ‘Justice for Oku-Boki Burnt Women’ and rounded up at the Millennium Park popularly referred to as Eleven Eleven. Speaking on behalf of the victims, the Advocacy for Alleged Witches (AfAW) alleged that an aide to the Cross River State governor led local thugs to attack and set ablaze some suspected witches in Oku community in Boki Local Government Area of the state.. The group regretted that the alleged perpetrators of this horrific crime were yet to be arrested by security agencies and demanded for justice for the gruesome act. The group listed the names of suspected 15 Witches and wizards allegedly burnt in Boki LGA of Cross River State to include Benard Kekong (known as papa Odu Ekpang), Rita Abang (known as Dachi Ochang), Margaret Akan (known as Ada Akan). Others were Edward Kekong, John Out, Mama Delia Kubua, Rose Obi, Patricia Obi, Kaka Olum, Mary Ada Out, Martina Maurice, Serah Kepua Odu, Paulina Owan, Sussana Bisong and another yet-to-be confirmed person. The group said that the three persons who were set ablaze have died as a result of their wounds and gave their names to include Benard Kekong, Rita Abang, and Margaret Akan. Other victims are at various hospitals battling for their lives. “Some of the victims who could not afford the cost of medical treatment are at home. The buttock of one of the victims, Serah Kepua Odu was completely burnt. “She cannot sit down. Another victim, Sussana Bisong, sustained serious injuries. She was unable to go to the hospital because she could not afford the hospital bills,” the group stated.

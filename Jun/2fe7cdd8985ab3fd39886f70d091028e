Paris Saint-Germain sporting director, Leonardo Araújo, has confirmed that striker, Edison Cavani and defender, Thiago Silva will both leave the club this summer. Both Cavani and Silva are out of contract with PSG in June. But the duo will remain with the club until the season is fully completed as PSG are in the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals after being crowned Ligue 1 champions last month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Cavani and Thiago Silva? Yes, we are coming to an end,” Leonardo told the Journal de Dimanche. “The idea is to continue playing with them until the end of August. “It was a very difficult decision to make; these are players who have marked the history of the club.” “Their stories were so beautiful. But yes, we are coming to an end.” Cavani and Silva have made a combined 404 league appearances for PSG so far.

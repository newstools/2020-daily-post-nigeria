The family of Professor Ekundayo E. Balogun have announced the passing of its matriarch, Mrs. Ebunoluwa Kofoworola Balogun. She died on June 24, 2020, in Houston, Texas, United States, at the age of 81. Her son-in-law, Professor Oluyinka Olutoye, who was celebrated in 2016 for leading a team of 21 doctors to conduct a surgery on a 23-week-old foetus and returning it to its mother’s womb in Texas, made the announcement. A statement he signed said Mrs. Balogun is fondly remembered by all for her compassionate and selfless nature. “She ensured that people enjoyed fair treatment in all ramifications of life and was unwavering in her commitment to positively influence lives in both her community and across the nation”, it read. Mrs. Balogun was a social worker who dedicated her life to defending the marginalised and supporting anti-racism causes. She completed her formative education in Nigeria before progressing to Virginia Union University in Richmond, Virginia, to obtain her undergraduate degree. Her passion for social justice occasioned her enrolment at the University of Wisconsin, in Madison, where she earned a post-graduate degree in Social Work. “The depth of her dedication to humanity is keenly felt in the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State, and other schools across Nigeria where she impacted lives”, Olutoye added. During her lifetime, Mrs. Balogun was as committed to humanity as she was to her religious beliefs. A devout member of Ebenezer Baptist Church, Ile-Ife, she was an active member for over 45 years and was involved in a plethora of altruistic acts, including active support for missionaries while being exemplary in radiating hospitality. She is survived by her husband, Professor Ekundayo E. Balogun, former Director of the African Space Science Centre, Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile-Ife, her daughters – Professor ‘Toyin Olutoye and Mrs. Folake Bamgboye – and grandchildren.

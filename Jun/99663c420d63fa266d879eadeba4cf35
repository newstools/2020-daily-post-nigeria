Following his resignation from the All Progressives Congress, APC, on Sunday, the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi has dismissed the insinuation that he will resign from the cabinet of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. According to Agboola, who on Sunday also registered his membership into the fold of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, he was elected by the people, and he is still serving their mandate. DAILY POST had on Sunday reported how the deputy governor dumped the APC which was the party he was elected alongside his boss, Akeredolu in 2016. Speaking shortly after picking his PDP membership card, Agboola said he only resigned as APC member and not as the deputy governor of the state “It’s my people that voted for me. They did not ask me to resign, so I remain the deputy governor of this state. I was duly elected as a deputy governor,” Agboola said. Meanwhile, the defection of the deputy governor from APC to PDP will be formalized on Monday in Akure, the Ondo State capital as the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus is expected to lead other stalwarts of the party to the state to formally welcome Agboola into the PDP fold.

Magnus Abe has commiserated with the Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi and his entire family over the death of Charles Amaechi. The former Senator’s condolence was conveyed in a statement on Sunday by his spokesperson, Parry Benson. He described the demise of the deceased as “a monumental loss, a vacuum that cannot be easily filled in the family of the Amaechis, Ubima, and indeed, Rivers State.” The Senator said Amaechi was a friendly, jovial, sincere, and generous individual. Abe told the former governor and other mourners to “look unto God”. “I wish to extend my sincere condolences to you and members of your family over the death of your elder brother, Dede.” He prayed that God will give the family strength to bear the loss and grant the departed eternal rest.

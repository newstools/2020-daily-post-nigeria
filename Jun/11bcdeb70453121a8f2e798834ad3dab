The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has claimed that he still enjoys the support from governors elected on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Obaseki stated this on Saturday, while speaking to reporters at the PDP National Secretariat in Abuja. The Governor was there to be screened for the June 25 governorship primary election of the opposition party. According to Obaseki, even dignitaries and other well-meaning Nigerians have come to identify with his aspiration, adding “they are all united against injustice.” Obaseki decamped to PDP, after he was disqualified from contesting in the APC governorship primaries in Edo State.

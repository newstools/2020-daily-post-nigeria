The National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency, (NDLEA) Yobe State Command said in its effort to address drug abuse and trafficking, it has confiscated 2,767 kilogrammes of hard drugs from 2017 to date. The NDLEA Yobe State Commander, Mr. Apeh Reuben, disclosed this on Friday in Damaturu, while addressing newsmen in commemoration of ‘United Nations International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking’. Reuben said “From 2017 to date, the command made arrests of 336 suspects and out of which 72 were convicted. “And 264 were counseled and released to their families as investigation revealed that they are users, and 2,767 kilograms of hard drugs were also seized within the period”, he said. Reuben also explained that since creation of Yobe state command in 2003 the volume of arrests and seizures were enormous. “From the year 2003 to date the command successfully made arrest of 1,801 suspects out of which 1,771 ware males while 30 were women and 10, 728 kilogrammes of both cannabis and psychotropic substance were seized. “There are successful conviction of 189 drugs offenders and 1,612 were cancelled and released to their relations as all of them were found to be users”, he added. He noted that the basis for the command’s continued success in its operations in the state was connected to the support of Yobe government. “In fact, the state government is indeed very serious about the quest to rid the state from the menace of drug abuse and trafficking by giving its full support to fight the hard drugs scourge”, Reuben said. Mr. Reuben, however, warned the general public stop indulging in the illicit use and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. He stressed that NDLEA would not relent in its effort to arrest dealers and users of narcotic and psychotropic substances no matter their social status. According to the 2020 drug report released by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, (UNODC) around 269 million people used drugs worldwide in 2018, which is 30 per cent more than in 2009, while over 35 million people suffer from drug use disorders. The theme for the 2020 International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking is “Better Knowledge for Better Care”.

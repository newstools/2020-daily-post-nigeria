The federal government has warned that Nigeria might start to count bodies in their hundreds in the next three weeks, as the COVID-19 cases continue to increase. As at Sunday morning, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced the country has 19,808 confirmed cases. The Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, explained that the numbers were rising, because the testing capacity has been increased. Mustapha also admitted that Nigeria is yet to enter into the second wave of the pandemic. “The figures you see now are a reflection of the testing capacity of the country. We have ramped up testing. From just about two centres, we now have over 30 and so, the results are the figures you see now. “The outcome of which will be an increase in the number of casualties in the next three weeks, when they’ll start manifesting,” he said.

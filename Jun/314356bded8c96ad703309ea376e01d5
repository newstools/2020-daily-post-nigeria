The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has said he will not speculate on any plan by the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, to join the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Obaseki is believed to be seeking another platform to realize his second-term bid, after the APC disqualified him from contesting in the June 22 primaries. The Governor last week met with two PDP Governors – Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and Emmanuel Udom of Akwa Ibom State. Oshiomhole, speaking after a meeting of APC’s National Working Committee (NWC) with President Muhammadu Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, on Monday, said: “I don’t know about exit. What we see from your media, electronic and print, is that he visited a number of PDP governors. “We read from electronic and print that those consultations may have to do with his plan and so on. But we are not here to speculate.” DAILY POST reported that the Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State, Tony Aziegbemi, has claimed Obaseki and all his loyalists were set to join the party.

Jigawa State Governor Alhaji, Muhammad Badaru Abubakar has lifted lockdown and ordered for the immediate opening of all weekly markets in the State. The Governor stated this during a press briefing at the Government House, Dutse, the State capital. He said the directives followed the decreasing number of positive cases in the State. “In the last week, only seven cases were recorded throughout the State and 222 out of 283 COVID-19 cases have been discharged from the isolation center,” he stated. He said that the State government found it not necessary to lift the weekly markets suspension and all the areas where lockdown order was imposed. Badaru said despite the reopening of the weekly markets and lifting of lockdown, people must strictly obey all advice of health experts to avoid community transmission. He said the decreasing number of patients follows the government’s efforts in ramping up testing capacity and increase in surveillance. He, however, stated that the State’s molecular Covid-19 laboratory had been completed and was awaiting accreditation for full operation.

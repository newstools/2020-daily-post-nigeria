The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, has reacted to the British government announcement of a cheap and widely available drug that saves patients seriously ill with COVID-19. Recall that British Prime Minister on Tuesday said UK researchers identified a new drug, which is effective and has reduced COVID-19 deaths risk. The drug identified as Dexamethasone has reduced death risk for patients in ventilators by one-third and oxygen by one fifth. Reacting, the NCDC in a tweet on its official Twitter handle, said the drug will not be used to treat patients because it has not been approved by the World Health Organization, WHO. It said, “The NCDC is aware of recent outcomes from a UK-Government funded clinical trial for COVID-19. “The results support the use of Dexamethsaone as a possible treatment to reduce the risk of death among COVID-19 patients, who require oxygen or mechanical ventilation. “Please note that the Government of Nigeria has not validated or approved any treatment for COVID-19. “In addition, the use of Dexamethasone for COVID-19 treatment has not been validated by @WHO.”

A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has said the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has been thrown under the bus and retired from politics. This is following President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to back a former Deputy National Secretary of the APC, Chief Victor Giadom, to continue as the party’s Acting National Chairman. Buhari on Wednesday said “the law is on the side of Victor Giadom”, in his quest to become the Acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Buhari made his position known in a statement signed by his spokesperson, Garba Shehu. The president explained that he has received “very convincing advice” and will hold a virtual meeting with Giadom tomorrow (Thursday). Fani Kayode while reacting, tweeted, “First Oshiomole is kicked out by the Court of Appeal. Then his preferred replacement, Ajimobi, falls into a coma. Then his arch rival, Giadom, is recognised by Buhari as National Chairman. “Conclusion: it is over for Tinubu. He has been thrown under the bus and retired from politics!”

Liverpool’s 4-0 thrashing of Crystal Palace on Wednesday night, leaves them on the verge of winning their first Premier League title in 30 years. Jurgen Klopp’s men once again showed they are the best side this season, sweeping away Roy Hodgson’s men in emphatic style. Trent Alexander-Arnold opened the scoring at an empty Anfield with a classy free-kick, before fit-again Mohammed Salah doubled the lead before half time. Fabinho and Sadio Mane added two more goals after the break, as Liverpool took their points total to 86 points from 31 fixtures. Second-placed Manchester City have 63 points from 30 games played. This means the Reds are just two points away from clinching the title. That could actually happen at Stamford Bridge on Thursday evening, when Chelsea host City. If Pep Guardiola’s men win, then the champagne stays on ice a little longer. However, if the champions draw or lose, then the points gap will be too big and Liverpool will champions. Jurgen Klopp might prefer to win it on City’s ground, as they travel to The Etihad in their next game.

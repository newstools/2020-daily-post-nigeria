Senate President, Bukola Saraki has condemned the alleged rape and murder of Vera Uwaila Omozuwa, a 100-level Microbiology student of the University of Benin, UNIBEN. Uwaila, a 100-level Microbiology student of UNIBEN, was allegedly raped and killed by some unknown persons while reading in a Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, in Benin City. Her death has generated diverse opinion from Nigerians and prominent persons who have called for justice. Reacting, Saraki on his Twitter page called for justice for the deceased. The PDP chieftain while praying for her family appealed to relevant authorities to fish out the perpetrators of the evil act. “The reports of the rape and murder of a 22-year-old undergraduate of the University of Benin, Uwa Omozuwa, in a church in Benin city are extremely shocking. Such savagery has no place in the Nigerian society. “As a people, we have to work to create safe spaces for our girls and women – in our homes, at work and in our places of worship – free from any and all sorts of sexual violation. And I say this not just because I’m a girl dad but because it is the right thing to do. “I strongly appeal to our law enforcement agencies to leave no stone uncovered in finding the perpetrators of this heinous act and bringing them to justice. “I pray that the Almighty comforts the Omozuwa family and strengthens them at this very difficult time.”

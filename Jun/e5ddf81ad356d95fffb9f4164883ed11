Popular Nigerian cross-dresser, Idris Ogunleye, also known as Bobrisky has stirred reactions on social media after he dressed up as a man to his parent’s house. Bobrisky, in a viral video on Tuesday, attended his father’s birthday dressed in men’s outfit without no earrings or makeup. The cross-dresser has since his conversion never worn such outfits. His appearance stirred reactions from Nigerians as some took to their Twitter page to mock the ‘Nigerian Barbie’ Here are some reactions gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter; @Sugarbutterjay “It is obvious that his father is not accepting of who he is.

Oga already knows African homes are no respecter of Range Rover Velar because if he appeared there as a lady, he must join the women to cook, wash plates and serve food.

He’s sly like that! VIDEO:

Ahead of the October 20, 2020, governorship election in Ondo State, Deputy Senate Leader, Prof Ajayi Boroffice yesterday endorsed one of the aspirants within the All Progressives Congress, APC, Prince Jimi Odimayo. Prof Ajayi Boroffice who is representing Ondo North Senatorial District at the National Assembly stated that his resolve to rally support for Odimayo who is venturing into the political space for the first time was borne out of the refusal for aspirants within the Unity Forum to step down for one another. Odimayo is one of the 10 aspirants within the Unity Forum, a group of aggrieved APC aspirants and stalwarts in Ondo State seeking to unseat Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The group led by the former Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Alhaji Ali Olanusi had been enmeshed in crisis following the adoption of Chief Olusola Oke as its consensus candidate with the aspirants describing the process as a ruse. According to Boroffice, a patron of the group who had also moved against the consensus candidacy, Odimayo is a redeemer who will sanitize the “fouled political atmosphere of Ondo State” While congratulating Odimayo for picking the APC nomination form, Boroffice expressed optimism that he will emerge as the party’s flag bearer at the July 20 primaries. He said, “To the best of my knowledge, Prince Jimi Odimayo is the first aspirant among all the aspirants from the Unity Forum to achieve this milestone. This feat underscores your sincerity of purpose and confidence. “It is instructive to note that I had appealed to all aspirants in the Unity Forum to come together to present a flagbearer for the forthcoming APC governorship election. This idea has not been achievable because of the incurable optimism of aspirants as no aspirant is willing to step aside for the other.

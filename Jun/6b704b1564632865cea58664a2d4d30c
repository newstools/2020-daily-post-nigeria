The Police in Ogun State said despite government’s order postponing the reopening of religious centers, it has received an intelligence that some leaders were planning to reopen mosques and churches. A statement on Saturday by its spokesman, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, warned against the actualisation of the plan. It warned those who have such intention to have a rethink because it “will be viewed as a deliberate attempt to cause the widespread of the virus in the state”. Oyeyemi said the Police, as a responsible organization constitutionally mandated to maintain peace and order, will not fold its hands while individuals openly flout the law. He disclosed that all the area Commanders, DPOs as well as the Command’s tactical squads have been directed to be on surveillance patrol. Oyeyemi declared that anyone found disobeying government’s directive will face the music. The statement added that the against coronavirus “should be seen as a collective responsibility and we should all join hands with government to defeat the virus once and for all”.

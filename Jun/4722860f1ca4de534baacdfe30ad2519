Aisha’s other security aides have also been returned to the Presidential Villa.

Aisha and her children – Zahra, Halima and Yusuf – headed to his residence at House 8 by the Pilot Gate to confront him. Buhari’s wife was accompanied by Shugaba, Escort Commander, DSP Sheriff Kazeem (son of former Inspector General, Hafiz Ringim), and four riot policemen. The confrontation led to a brawl and the ADC allegedly fired gunshots. Yusuf ran to the residence of his uncle and Buhari’s nephew, Mamman Daura, who then communicated the matter to the president.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirant in Edo State, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has said the crisis within the party will end after the governorship primary. Ize-Iyamu emerged the ruling party’s flagbearer on Monday, after his main contender Dr. Pius Odubu stepped down hours before the exercise. The third aspirant, Osaro Obazee, had withdrawn from the race earlier. Despite Ize-Iyamu having a free run to the ticket, 3,776 delegates voted for Odubu and 2,724 for Obazee. Ize-Iyamu polled 27,838. Addressing newsmen after his victory, Ize-Iyamu called on all APC leaders in the 192 wards in Edo state, to come together and unite the party. “Sometimes ago, somebody asked me ‘when the problems of APC will end?” “I told him that every problem has an expiry date. In my humble opinion, I said the day we complete our primary election, that day, the problems would end. “So, I believe that by this process, which we have just completed, the party is now on the path of full recovery,” he said.

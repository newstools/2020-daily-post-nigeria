Hon Paully Onyeka, former member representing Ekwusigo state constituency in Anambra State House of Assembly says the former governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Prof Chukwuma Soludo will use his connection to create wealth in Anambra if he becomes governor. The close ally of the former CBN Governor who spoke with DAILY POST in Awka said the reason many people were yearning for Soludo to contest for the governorship position of the state was because of his numerous connections. He said, “As I speak with you, there are over 25 self-funded groups that are already working to drag Soludo into the contest, and they know why. “Prof has not even said anything, he is just watching and also making his own calculations, and at the right time, I am sure he will speak. “Soludo as governor of Anambra State will make use of his contacts to provide wealth. You may not know, but there is no financial institution in the world that he does not have a connection to its top management. “Raising funds for projects will be a very easy thing when Soludo becomes governor and a lot of the people who are asking him to come and contest know this. “You will see the money that will come to Anambra when he becomes governor. “There is no financial institution in the world that Prof does not either have a link to its management or worked there or even consulted for them, none in the whole world. What he knows, all the other aspirants do not know,” Onyeka said. Soludo, a member of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA has been touted to be a top contender for the governorship position of the state, even though he is yet to openly express interest. Anambra will in November next year hold its governorship election to elect a successor for Willie Obiano who in March 2022 will handover, after eight years in office.

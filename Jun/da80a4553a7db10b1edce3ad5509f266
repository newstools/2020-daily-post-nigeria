The All Progressives Congress, (APC) in Ekiti State has advised the opposition People’s Democratic Party, (PDP) to face its internal wrangling and woes rather than insulting the good people of the state with its incongruously written comments. The APC, in a statement in Ado Ekiti on Tuesday, noted that the opposition PDP or any of its distraught members has no moral right to comment on the ongoing cargo airport project currently being executed by the APC controlled administration. The statement, signed by the Director of Media and Publicity of APC, Elder Sam Oluwalana explained that the criticism from the opposition PDP is only reminding the people of the state of the chains of dirty deals and sufferings unleashed on them by the immediate past administration of Mr. Ayo Fayose. “This is an administration that earmarked over N10 billion for the cargo airport and nothing to show for this taxpayers money. “At the inception of the present administration of Dr. Kayode Fayemi, nothing concrete or visible was found at the project site despite the huge amount of money earmarked for it and approved by the house of assembly,” he added. According to him, now that the project has been revisited and work has commenced in earnest at the site, the opposition party started raising baseless and unfounded allegations. “If members of the PDP are not suffering from symptoms of senility or dementia praecox, it is better for them to concentrate on resolving the internal bickering currently bedevilling the party. “I am aware that PDP members resort to blackmail in their desperate attempt to redeem their battered and diminished fortune, but the good people of Ekiti State know and understand better. “From the huge amount of money budgeted for the airport project, Fayose found it difficult to pay compensation to landowners whose properties were acquired for the project.” Elder Oluwalana declared.

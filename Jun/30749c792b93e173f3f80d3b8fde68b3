An Ondo based journalist who was reported to have contracted COVID-19 has denied being infected by the deadly coronavirus. The 33-year-old journalist who resides in Ore, Odigbo Local Government Area kicked against the position of government that he had the virus. Meanwhile, two additional COVID-19 deaths were yesterday recorded in the state. The patients were said to be over 60 years with underlying health challenges. With the new deaths recorded, the state now has a total of nine deaths. According to the journalist (name withheld) who works with a radio station in the state, the public should ignore information that he tested positive for coronavirus. While briefing his colleagues after he was discharged from the Infectious Disease Hospital (IDH), he maintained that he had malaria without having any traces of COVID-19 symptoms. He also disclosed that he recovered from the sickness three weeks ago before he was invited during contact tracing of a patient in Odigbo Local Government Area of the state. The journalist stressed further that during his first day at the IDH, an NCDC personnel who conducted another test for him confirmed him negative, yet he was still held at the facility. He said that during his stay at the centre, he was given chloroquine and vitamin C. Meanwhile, when contacted, the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro described the journalist’s claim as false, stressing that the state government has nothing to gain by lying about anyone’s status. Dr. Adegbenro said that when his samples were first taken, it returned positive from the molecular testing centre in Ede, Osun. While urging the journalist to desist from spreading falsehood as it could hinder the fight against the virus, the Health Commissioner disclosed that antiretroviral drugs were being administered on patients at the IDH as against the vitamin C and Chloroquine claim of the journalist. Dr. Adegbenro also confirmed the deaths of COVID-19 patients at the IDH.

Operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, have arrested a 32-year-old Boniface Oburuku for theft of a handbag, belonging to an international guest from the Republic of Mauritius. DAILY POST learned that the bag contained her two Samsung mobile phones, an international passport, United States dollars, Nigerian and Mauritian currencies. EFCC spokesman, Dele Oyewale said this in a statement to newsmen in Abuja. Further Oyewale explained, “Oburuku committed the crime on June 11, 2019, at an event organized by the EFCC to mark the year’s National Democracy Day and Anti-Corruption Summit at Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja, which had in attendance, President Muhammadu Buhari, Nigerian security chiefs, respected citizens and global leaders. “For over one year, the suspect has been on the Commission’s watch list and was eventually arrested in Lagos few days ago”. But the EFCC Counter-Terrorism and General Investigations Unit said, “The Commission swung into action through intelligence on the suspect all over the country, which showed that he was constantly on the move from Mpape area of the FCT to Jabi and later to Gwagwalada, all in the FCT. He finally settled in Lagos where he was arrested”. Part of the statement reads, “Investigations also revealed that to breach security at the day’s event, Oburuku dressed smartly in a black suit and claimed to be of the Department of State Security (DSS) and was allowed access into the venue by security agents on duty without presentation of an invite. “While confessing to the crime, Oburuku apologized to President Buhari, the EFCC and his Mauritian victim. He called on others who are into fraudulent and criminal activities to turn a new leaf. “He would soon be charged to court”.

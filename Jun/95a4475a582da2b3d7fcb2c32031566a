The Nigerian Government has announced that the duration for each church service must not exceed one hour. The government said that Sunday Schools, night vigils, children classes and Islamiya schools still remain suspended. This was made known on Tuesday by the National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu. The PTF Coordinator said churches will open from 5am and close by 8pm with each service lasting for just an hour. “For churches, each service should be for a maximum of an hour with an interval of thirty minutes in between services to allow time for disinfection,” Aliyu said. He further explained that Friday prayers in mosques should also not exceed one hour. “Mosques may open 15 minutes before and ten minutes after prayers. The total time for Friday prayers should not exceed an hour,” Aliyu announced.

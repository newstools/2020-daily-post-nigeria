Roma has repeatedly offered Arsenal winger, Justin Kluivert as they attempt to sign midfielder, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, on a permanent basis this summer’s transfer window. This was made known by respected transfer expert and sports journalist, Nicolo Schira. Schira disclosed this in a tweet via his official Twitter account on Saturday night. According to him, talks are ongoing with the agents of Kluivert and Mkhitaryan to finalise the deal. Schira said: “Roma want to buy Henrikh Mkhitaryan on a permanent deal. “Giallorossi has offered Arsenal a swap with Justin Kluivert. “Talks ongoing with the agent of two players: Mino Raiola. Transfers AFC.” DAILY POST recalls that Mkhitaryan has spent the current campaign out on loan in Roma. Roma wants Mkhitaryan back at the Stadio Olimpico next season. Mkhitaryan has a year left on his contract with Arsenal, and the North London club will be keen to sell the Armenian international at a high fee. Arsenal value the 31-year-old at around £10million, but Roma’s valuation is even lower than that.

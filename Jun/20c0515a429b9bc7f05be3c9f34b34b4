The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has claimed he might not get justice, after he was screened by a committee set up by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to vet aspirants contesting the party’s ticket ahead of the governorship election. The whole exercise lasted for about two hours at the APC national secretariat in Abuja on Wednesday. In a chat with reporters after the screening, Obaseki insisted that the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, has refused to rescue himself from the process. The Governor said: “Like I said, as a party man I had to go through the screening process but I do not believe that I will get justice because Comrade Adams Oshiomhole is an interested party in the Edo process. “One of the questions asked was why did I issue a gazette that will prevent the party from performing direct elections in Edo. That, did I not see it as an anti-party activity?” The APC primary election will hold June 22.

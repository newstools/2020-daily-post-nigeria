Gunmen suspected to be herdsmen on Wednesday morning attacked Tudu village in Doka, Kufana District of Kajuru Local Government Area, killing nine persons, and setting many houses ablaze. A resident of the area, Mr. Titus Jacob who spoke to DAILY POST said the armed bandits numbered over 15 came around 9.00am, and started shooting sporadically, as nine people were killed, while houses were set ablaze. ” The gunmen came around 9.00 am and started shooting. Many people were running to different directions, shouting. Though, I ran for safety, and hid somewhere closed to the village. They operated for about 45 minutes,” he said. Mr. Jacob said they went back to the village after the attackers vanished and discovered nine bodies, even as several houses were burnt. He said the gunmen had operated and left before the security personnel at Makyelli close to the village could reach there. ” The army officers at the check point in Makyelli were informed. But, before they could get there, the gunmen had disappeared into the bush,” he said. Kaduna State Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Mohammed Jalige could not pick his calls, even as he could not respond to text messages sent to him for confirmation.

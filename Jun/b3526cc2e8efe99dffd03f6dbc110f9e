The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has advised members of the National Working Committee of the party dissolved by President Muhammadu Buhari to seek elective offices, if they so choose. In a statement signed by his spokesman, Tunde Rahman and forwarded to DAILY POST, Tinubu urged them to seek any party office provided they are eligible. He also insisted that any decisions made, was to “restore and maintain internal democracy” in APC. “As I understand it, no one has been precluded from seeking any party office to which he is otherwise eligible. Former NWC members are free to seek re-election to the NWC. “Provided they have the support of party members, they will have an opportunity to return to serve the party in a leadership capacity. This reflects our overriding desire to restore and maintain internal democracy not subvert it,” Tinubu said. During Thursday’s NEC meeting, the APC’s National Working Committee (NWC) was dissolved. The decision was taken with Buhari, Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, embattled Deputy National Secretary of APC, Victor Giadom and some members of the APC National Working Committee, in attendance.

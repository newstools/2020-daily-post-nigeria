Armed men suspected to be sea pirates have allegedly hijacked a passenger boat around the Namasibi axis of the New Calabar River, Degema Local Government Area of Rivers State. It was gathered the boat was travelling from Port Harcourt to Ke Clan in Degema before armed bandits attacked the boat. The boat rider, Tamunoiminabo Aginah and the boat owner, Precious Christopher who confirmed the incident to newsmen, said the whereabouts of some of the passengers is still unknown. According to Aginah, “In the morning when we were driving to Port Harcourt, the sea pirates chased us, but they couldn’t get to us. “On our way back to Ke from Port Harcourt as we approached Namasibi, New Calabar River, the sea pirates appeared in full speed with a superior engine boat and we couldn’t escape them. “They ordered us to jump into the river. Those that can swim did as they commanded while they drove away with those that didn’t jump into the river to an unknown destination together with our boat.” When contacted the spokesman of Rivers State Police Command Nnamdi Omoni said the command was not aware of the attack but promised to reach out to the Divisional Police Officer of the area.

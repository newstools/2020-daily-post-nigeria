Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has described winning the Premier League title as an “unbelievable’ achievement. The Reds were confirmed champions following Chelsea’s 2-1 win over Manchester City on Thursday night. It was their first league title in 30 years. “I have no words. It’s unbelievable,” Klopp told Sky Sports after the match. “It’s much more than I ever thought. To become champions with this outstanding club is unbelievable.” Liverpool lead City with 23 points in the table and have won the title with seven games to spare. “It’s an incredible achievement for my players,” Klopp added. Man City host Liverpool next Thursday at The Etihad and are expected to give the new champions a guard of honour.

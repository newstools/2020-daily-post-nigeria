The leader of the Catholic Church, Pope Francis has declared that the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis is over. The pontiff said this while addressing the Catholic congregation for the first time at Saint Peter’s Square, Rome, since the ban on religious congregation due to COVID-19 in the country. The Vatican had yesterday said there were no more cases of COVID-19 within its population. “Your presence in the square is a sign that in Italy the acute phase of the epidemic is over,” Francis told those assembled for his weekly Angelus prayer. “But be careful… do not celebrate victory too soon,” he added. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni in a statement yesterday night said that the last person found to have been infected with the virus in recent weeks had tested negative.

Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki will on Wednesday, June 24, 2020 know his fate whether he would participate in the Edo State Peoples Democratic Party primaries or not. A Federal High Court sitting in Port Harcourt had on Monday restrained Governor Godwin Obaseki from participating in the PDP gubernatorial primary. The suit was instituted by an aspirant, Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihiama, asking the court to stop the governor who just defected to the party from participating in the shadow election. Justice E.A Obile is expected to deliver ruling after hearing the matter on Wednesday ahead of Thursdayâ€™s primary of the PDP. In the meantime, sources say Ogbeide-Ihama is being pushed by a prominent South-South Governor and a PDP Leader in Edo who wants a hold on the PDP structure of the state. The Governor, DAILY POST gathered, fears that the Edo PDP structure will be lost to Obaseki who will become the leader of the party if returned as Edo State Governor come September. The Edo State PDP primary Committee led by the Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed are not parties in the matter, indicating that the process may run without Governor Obaseki.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808463" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7264C5BA-FECF-4B7E-B6FD-4E4D47743070.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="950" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7264C5BA-FECF-4B7E-B6FD-4E4D47743070.jpeg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/7264C5BA-FECF-4B7E-B6FD-4E4D47743070-227x300.jpeg 227w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808464" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEF2CEB8-3C37-45D7-9383-CFFE714B8EB4.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="913" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEF2CEB8-3C37-45D7-9383-CFFE714B8EB4.jpeg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BEF2CEB8-3C37-45D7-9383-CFFE714B8EB4-237x300.jpeg 237w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808465" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DBB93B07-AB1C-4377-BD9F-94CE70488652.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="929" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DBB93B07-AB1C-4377-BD9F-94CE70488652.jpeg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/DBB93B07-AB1C-4377-BD9F-94CE70488652-233x300.jpeg 233w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

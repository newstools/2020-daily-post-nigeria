British professional boxer, Dillian Whyte has warned WBC president, Mauricio Sulaiman that former heavyweight champion, Mike Tyson, may die in the ring. Sulaiman had publicly backed Tyson’s proposed comeback and even said he would support the 53-year-old making a run for British fighter, Tyson Fury’s heavyweight title belt. Tyson has been posting training videos recently, with reports suggesting the American could return to the ring in a series of exhibition fights in Australia. But according to Whyte, it is silly for Sulaiman to be encouraging Tyson to challenge the reigning heavyweight champion, Fury. “It’s silly. If they cannot sanction a fight with me for three years, why the hell are they going to sanction a fight with a 53-year-old man and a 31-year-old man? “It makes no sense. That is silly. Mauricio and I are cool, but it is a very silly thing to say. “He should not be encouraging it. “What if he comes back and dies in the ring? What is going to happen then? “We have already got enough darkness and enough mud thrown on the sport as it is, we do not need anymore,” Whyte told talkSPORT.

Manchester United’s European Cup-winning legend, Tony Dunne has died at the age of 78. The Red Devils in a tweet via its Twitter account on Monday confirmed the news of his demise, though the cause of his death is yet to be revealed. The tweet reads “One of our greatest-ever full-backs an integral part of the 1968 European Cup-winning side, Tony Dunne is dead. “He was a player who made 535 appearances in the red shirt of Manchester United. “Our heartfelt condolences go to the loved ones of Tony Dunne. “May he rest in peace.” Also, his former team-mate Alex Stepney in a tribute to him described him as an unbelievable full-back and incredible player. “It’s very sad news, Tony was a great team-mate, an unbelievable full-back, and an incredible player. “When I came to the club in September 1966 Tony was a left-back. ”He was later switched to right-back after the club had another left-back, Bobby Noble. “The club also won the First Division Championship in 1967 with Tony at right back. “That kind of versatility was very rare in those days but Tony was brilliant. “He just did his job with the minimum fuss. “He was switched back to left-back for the season we won the European Cup in 1968 and he was outstanding, a real unsung hero. “Like me, he played over 500 games at United, but he wasn’t what you’d call a robust full-back, he was a thinking man’s defender,” he said. The Irishman, who joined United as an 18-year-old in 1960, played 535 first-team matches for the club, putting him eighth on their all-time appearance list. He was also part of the United side who beat Benfica 4-1 at Wembley in 1968. Dunne earned 33 caps for his country, four as captain, and was named Irish Footballer of the Year in 1969.

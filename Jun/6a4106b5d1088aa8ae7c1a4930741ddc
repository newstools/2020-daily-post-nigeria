Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has told Mesut Ozil that he will be restored to the team, when he “can give his best”. Ozil was dropped for the Gunners’ trip to Manchester City on Wednesday night. Before the COVID-19 enforced break, the German playmaker featured in all games since Arteta took over in December. Arteta, who claimed Ozil was left out of his squad for the 3-0 defeat for tactical reasons, told a press conference on Thursday, that he is always open with the player. “A lot has happened to him in the last few weeks and I have to respect the timing of every player. Sometimes they need a little bit of time. “It has been difficult preparation in the last two months to get players ready. “Again, I am the first one who wants Mesut at his best. I will put him on the pitch when I think he can give his best,” the Spaniard said. It remains to be seen if Ozil will be recalled for the trip to Brighton this Saturday.

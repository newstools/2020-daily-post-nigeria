Ayo Fayose, former Ekiti State Governor, says there is nothing to celebrate as Nigeria marks the June 12 Democracy Day. He stated that Nigerians are mourning and that democracy will return when President Muhammadu Buhari leaves office. Fayose’s message was contained in a statement on Friday by his spokesperson, Lere Olayinka. Fayose said it was painful that the “legacy of free elections” bequeathed by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has been “destroyed”. “Elections in the country are now being held at gunpoint”, the former governor decried. He said peace and prosperity can only be achieved when leaders emerge legitimacy through the ballot. Fayose condemned the “open display of contempt for free, fair and transparent election by the All Progressives Congress (APC) government”. He said: “Democracy will return to Nigeria again after President Buhari’s tenure. Today, there is no democracy to celebrate and I have not stopped wondering how we got here in Nigeria. “I am sure Nigerians will still recall that I warned them in 2015. The people mourn when the wicked are in authority while they rejoice when the righteous are in leadership. Today, Nigerians are mourning.” Fayose urged Nigerians to all “keep hope alive because, after darkness, there will definitely be light”.

Twenty-eight State Executive Committee (SEC) members of the All progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers, have suspended Igo Aguma, as the Caretaker Chairman. The members, who are loyalists of Minister of Transport, Rotimi Amaechi, made the announcement on Monday, just two weeks after Aguma’s court victory. A core Amaechi’s ally and former Rivers East Senator, Andrew Uchendu, spoke on a resolution reached in Port Harcourt. He said former Executive Director, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Dr Sokonte Davis, had been appointed as new Acting Chairman. Aguma was recognised as APC Caretaker Committee Chairman following a High Court judgement delivered by Justice George Omereji. The court ordered all statutory SEC members of the Rivers APC to be part of the committee. But Uchendu said Aguma disrespected the court judgment by taking critical decisions without the committee members. The former lawmaker declared that the 28 SEC members out of a total of 38, oppose Aguma’s actions. “He constituted himself into a sole administrator, relegating, abandoning and disregarding the committee, and taking critical decisions affecting the party all by himself”, NAN quoted him as saying. “Aguma summoned a virtual meeting of the statutory members of SEC on June 14, he deliberately denied the majority of SEC members the User Identity and password to access the meeting,” he said. He noted that the court did not pronounce Aguma a sole administrator of the party in Rivers. Uchendu insisted that by the judgment, every statutory member of SEC forms part of the caretaker committee and must be part of the decision-making.

The federal government has admitted that it relaxed the lockdown that lasted about two months, to prevent the economy from collapsing. The Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Dr. Sani Aliyu, stated this during Thursday’s daily briefing in Abuja, the nation’s capital. Aliyu also made it clear that Nigeria is still in the middle of the spread of coronavirus. “We relaxed the lockdown not because COVID-19 has gone, but to ensure the economy does not collapse. “We would not sit back and allow public safety to be endangered by a few people,” he said. As at today, there are 17,735 confirmed cases of COVID-19. A total of 5,967 patients have been discharged, while 469 are dead.

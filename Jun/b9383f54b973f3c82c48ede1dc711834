Former Liverpool skipper, Steven Gerrard, has admitted he still has regrets over his infamous slip that cost the club a Premier League title. However, in an interview with The Athletic, he insists he will be as happy as anyone to see the Reds win the trophy this season. Gerrard’s error in the 2013/2014 season gifted Chelsea a goal, from which Liverpool never recovered and Manchester City eventually won the league. In addition to the 2013/2014 season, Liverpool finished four points off Manchester United in 2008/2009 and were also runners up in 2001/2002. By the time Gerrard left Liverpool, the Premier League title was the only trophy missing from his impressive list of honours. Now six years on, the Reds are on the verge of ending the club’s 30-year wait. “Since I finished I’ve only wanted to wish the players that I played with every success,” he told The Athletic. “I have to live with my regrets if you like and I don’t think they will ever go away. I came close on three occasions. What happened in 2014 is well documented and probably talked about more than the others because of the Chelsea game and how cruel that was. “But that’s for me to deal with in terms of the little regrets that linger from when I played.”

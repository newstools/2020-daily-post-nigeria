Manchester City player, Eric Garcia was on Wednesday night rushed to the hospital after a heavy head collision with club goalkeeper, Ederson, in City’s 3-0 win over Arsenal in the English Premier League. The defender, who was having a fine game helping his side keep a clean sheet in their first game after the coronavirus suspension, was knocked to the ground by Ederson as he came out of his penalty area to clear the ball in the 80th minute of the game at Etihad Stadium. A stretcher was immediately called for as players from both sides stood concerned for the 19-year-old’s condition. He was later given oxygen and carried off on a stretcher after nearly 10 minutes of treatment by medical staff. However, Manchester City Head coach, Pep Guardiola in the post-game conference, confirmed that the defender was conscious but further tests will be carried out. ”We are a little bit concerned about Eric, he is conscious, which is actually a good sign but he’s going to make an extra test in the hospital. “At the beginning of the march it was a lot of energy and everybody wanted the ball. “I am happy with the performance of the team. ”I see in a good shape, the team, which is a good thing for the next few games,” he said.<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-805626" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1160.jpg" alt="" width="1166" height="1675" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1160.jpg 1166w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1160-209x300.jpg 209w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1160-713x1024.jpg 713w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG_1160-1069x1536.jpg 1069w" sizes="(max-width: 1166px) 100vw, 1166px">

Ivan Rakitic came off the bench to score for Barcelona, as they beat Athletic Bilbao 1-0 on Tuesday night. The victory ensures Barcaâ€™s LaLiga title defence remains on track, following a 0-0 draw at Sevilla last week. The Catalans came into the game in second place although level on points with Real Madrid. Athletic Bilbao had the better chances in the first half with Yeray Alvarez and Inaki Williams. However, Barca improved in the second half and ultimately secured all three points. Madrid can return to the top today based on head-to-head record, if they beat Real Mallorca at home.

No fewer than nine persons have been allegedly killed and several others injured after suspected herdsmen attacked Agatu community in Benue State. DAILY POST gathered that the attack occurred Sunday morning in Adana community. The reason for the deadly attack remains unknown at the moment, but Benue TV quoted sources as saying the attack followed an allegation by herdsmen that the people of the village killed two of their people and rustled many of their cows. Confirming the incident, the Caretaker Chairman of Agatu Local Government Area, Hon.

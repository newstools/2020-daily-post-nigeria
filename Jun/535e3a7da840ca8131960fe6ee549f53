Governors on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have reacted to the removal and replacement of the party’s Deputy National Secretary, Victor Giadom. Giadom resumed his insistence on being the Acting National Chairman after the Court of Appeal upheld the suspension of National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. On Monday, the governors also spoke on the protest at the party’s national headquarters in Abuja. The stalwarts addressed State House Correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Progressive Governors Forum Chair and Kebbi Governor, Atiku Bagudu; Chairman of Northern Governors Forum and Plateau Governor, Simon Lalong, and Jigawa Governor, Abubakar Badaru, were in attendance. Badaru told newsmen that APC “believes in dialogue and contentious issues arise when you are dialoguing”. He said due to the “sanctity which President Buhari attaches to constitutionalism, we held our national convention literally at the same time we were holding primaries”. This, he noted, was because “Mr President has always said that we told Nigerians that our party is going to be a party of due process and we will do that, no matter the challenge of the moment”. Bagudu stated that “young people expressing their views by demonstrating, members of the party challenging court processes shows that the people are free to express their views, and dissent is not to be suppressed”. “What is important is that all are on board in arriving at a conclusion that will be to the satisfaction of most party members and Nigerians”, he said. However, the APC explained why Giadom could not be recognized as the Acting National Chairman.

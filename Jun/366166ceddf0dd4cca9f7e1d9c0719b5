The Plateau State House of Assembly on Tuesday, suspended the Chairman of Quaan Pan Local Government, Hon. Isaac Kwallu and his Kanam counterpart, Hon. Abas Wokdung, for illegally suspending their councillors and refusing to pay their entitlements. Speaker of the House, Rt. Hon. Abok Ayuba, who announced the suspension during plenary, directed the affected chairmen to immediately handover to their deputies. Addressing journalists after plenary, the House Committee Chairman on Information, Philip Dasun, said that the chairmen had been embroiled in some squabbles with their councillors. Dasun explained that the State House of Assembly invited them (the two chairmen) and subsequently directed them on what to do but they refused to obey the directives. “They were directed to pay the entitlements owed councillors but they fail to do so. “In the case of Kanam, he even sacked the substantive Clerk of the House posted there by the House of Assembly Service Commission and refuse to reinstate him as directed,” he explained. The Information Committee chairman maintained that the suspension of the Kwallu was not in connection with his senatorial ambition. Dasun said that it was Kwallu’s right to contest the seat since he hailed from the zone and that the House would not suspend him for exercising his political right. DAILY POST gathered that Kwallu’s suspension was base on his Senatorial ambition. Source from the ruling APC in the state said, Kwallu was advised not to go into the Senate contest for Plateau South, to replace deceased Senator Ignatius Longjan. It was also gathered that the powers that be in the party have their preferred candidate.

The Federal Government has said it will withhold the passports of travellers whether citizens or foreigners coming into the country. They will be required to leave their passports with the Nigeria Immigration Service for two weeks, until their COVID-19 status is confirmed. This was stated in circular released by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs and addressed to all diplomatic, consular and international organisations accredited to Nigeria. In the circular dated June 10, 2020, with reference number BW/20/CIR.LET/III/2020, the government said only those with diplomatic passports will be exempted. “Passengers will be cleared through the Nigeria Immigration Service System’s Migrant Identification and Data Analysis System and their passports retained until after successful completion of 14 days self-quarantine except diplomatic passport holders,” it read in part. After all the COVID-19 protocols have been followed, the NIS will be instructed to release the passports to their owners. The circular noted that alternative arrangements could be made to receive the passports via special delivery.

The Youth and Women wing of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Edo chapter, on Saturday, opposed the waiver granted Governor Godwin Obaseki by the national leadership. The waiver enables Obaseki, who just defected from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), contest in the PDP primary on Tuesday. Obaseki was screened on Saturday. Under the auspices of PDP Youths for Justice, a statement by the coordinator, Musa Kadiri, warned the party leadership to reward loyalty instead of looking for opportunities. He noted that the three aspirants – Ken Imasuagbon, Gideon Ikhine and Omoregie Ogbeide-Ihama – were capable of defeating any candidate the APC would present. NAN quoted Kadiri as warning that the PDP might witness implosion if Obaseki was given the ticket on a platter of gold. “We, the youths on ground in Edo know that the PDP has positioned itself to win the forthcoming gubernatorial election. We do not need Obaseki who is chased out of the APC based on questionable credentials”, he said. Also, PDP women wing in Egor Local Government led by Mrs. Imuwahen Osasu, said the Edo PDP did not need Obaseki. She said the election provided another opportunity to reward those that have been loyal to the party for over 12 years that the party has been out of power in the state.

Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams has said the struggles to free Nigerians from bondage will continue until the country is restructured. Adams said this in his June 12 message, describing the June 12, 1993 annulled election as the most defining moment in Nigeria’s history. In a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, Kehinde Aderemi, Adams lamented that democracy was yet to take its roots in Nigeria despite the sacrifices of the activists. According to him, democracy in Nigeria is evolving but not what was fought for during June 12 struggle. He, however, expressed optimism that Nigeria can progress when federating states develop at their own pace. The statement read in part: “When the federating units are allowed to develop at their own pace, there will be mutual benefits and progress in Nigeria. “The federating states will be geared towards achieving the best for the people at the grassroots. This will be possible when there is healthy competitions among the federating units.” According to him, the issue of security and state police would be taken care of without fair or favour when federalism is implemented. “It is good that our democracy is evolving, but sadly it is not yet Uhuru because this is not the kind of democracy we fought for during the June 12 struggle. “The journey for Nigeria’s democracy has been a tortuous one but today, our democracy is, at best, one step forward and five steps backward. But in all, we thank God that we are still alive to tell the story,” the statement added.

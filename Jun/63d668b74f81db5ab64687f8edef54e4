President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Babagana Kingibe on his 75th birthday. A statement to DAILY POST by Garba Shehu, his Spokesman, said the President joins family members, friends and political associates to celebrate the renowned diplomat, “whose service to the nation has been exemplary.” It added that Buhari “acknowledges Ambassador Kingibe’s laudable profile in public service, which include serving as Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Minister of Internal Affairs, Minister of Power and Steel, and at various times Nigerian Ambassador to Greece and Cyprus, Pakistan, and African Union Special Envoy to Sudan.” The President, according to the statement, “believes the diplomat’s venture into politics was expedient as he played key roles in shaping the nation’s history, most remarkably sharing a presidential candidate ticket with Chief MKO Abiola in an election that has remained the crux of Nigeria’s democracy and continues to define the trajectory of leadership.” Buhari “extols Ambassador Kingibe’s willingness to always answer the call of service in Nigeria, and the African continent, recalling how, from early years, he sacrificed his time and resources, working diligently as Principal Political Secretary in the Office of the President in the 70’s, where he contributed to military transfer of power, states creation and birth of the Second Republic.” He “prays that the Almighty God will continue to strengthen the renowned diplomat, and bless his family.”

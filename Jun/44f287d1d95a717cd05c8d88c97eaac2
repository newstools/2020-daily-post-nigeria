Shehu Sani, former Kaduna lawmaker has called for a resolution between doctors and the federal government over the current strike action by resident officers. Recall that the National Association of Resident Doctors (NARD) on Monday embarked on a nationwide strike due to the Government’s failure to meet demands made by the association. On Wednesday, the federal government threatened not to pay the salaries of doctors who fail to return to work. This followed a negotiation meeting convened by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, and the leadership of the Resident Doctors, which ended in a deadlock after hours of deliberation. Ngige mentioned that the major issues have been taken care of, while the government is still working on the other minor issues appealing to the doctors to return to work. However, the doctors hesitated, adding that the strike will be called off if the government brings something tangible to the table. Reacting, Sani on his Twitter page said the doctors strike is a serious setback to the efforts so far in Nigeria to contain Coronavirus. He, therefore, appealed to the government and Doctors to come to an agreement and negotiate. His tweet read: “Doctors strike; a serious setback to the efforts to combat or contain the pandemic. “The Government and the Union must negotiate.”

Manchester United legend, Ryan Giggs has given reasons striker, Odion Ighalo is different from other Red Devils strikers. According to Giggs, Ighalo gives Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a genuine centre forward presence in his squad, which the rest of the club’s strikers lack. Man United and Chinese side, Shanghai Shenhua reached an agreement to extend Ighalo’s loan contract until January 2021 a few days ago. “Ighalo is different, and he is a centre forward whereas the other strikers can play out wide,” Giggs was quoted by Sky Sports as saying. “He gives you something extra off the bench when he’s not starting. Centre forwards always want to score goals, and he has done that everywhere he has gone. “It is positive that he can stay because he has done well. He makes an impact when he’s on the pitch.” Ighalo netted four goals in eight appearances for Man United so far this season. The 30-year-old will hope to continue his impressive form for United once the Premier League resume on June 17.

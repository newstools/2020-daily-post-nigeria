The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared that mothers with suspected or confirmed case of coronavirus can breastfeed. WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said this at a press briefing on Friday. Dpa quoted him as saying based on the available evidence, the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of COVID-19. The UN agency encouraged mothers to initiate and continue breastfeeding and not be separated from their infants, “unless the mother is too unwell”. Ghebreyesus explained that evidence suggests children are at lower risk for catching the coronavirus than adults. However, they are at high risk of coming down with diseases and other conditions that breastfeeding helps prevent.

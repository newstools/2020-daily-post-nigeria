The Kwara State House of Assembly on Tuesday charged security agencies in the state to be proactive in preventing crimes through appropriate intelligence gathering towards addressing security challenges in the state. The House also called on the state government to encourage and motivate members of the community security outfits in the bid to checkmate insecurity in various communities of the state. These were part of the resolutions read by the Speaker of the House, Engr Yakubu Danladi Salihu, following the debate on a motion on insecurity in the state. The motion was moved by the House leader, Hon Magaji Abubakar Olawoyin from Ilorin Central constituency, and seconded by Hon Mohammed Baba Salihu. Hon Magaji said recent cult activities in the state were endangering the lives of innocent citizens in the state. The House leader, therefore, called on the security agencies to do more in curbing the deadly activities of cultists in the interest of the public.

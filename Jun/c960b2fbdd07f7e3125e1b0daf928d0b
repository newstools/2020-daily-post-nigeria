Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has launched a COVID-19 free bus scheme to cushion the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on residents in the state.  Inaugurating the Scheme in Port Harcourt, Mr. Sunny Ejekwu, the Commissioner for Transport in Rivers, praised the Governor for the initiative which is the first of its kind in Nigeria. Rivers Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim, made this known in a statement on Monday.  According to him, Ejekwu noted that the buses would ply Obio/Akpor, Port Harcourt, Oyigbo, and Eleme Local Government Areas as a pilot scheme. He said that the buses would pick and drop passengers only at designated bus stops and will operate from 6:30 am to 7 pm daily. “With the launch of this scheme, you can feel the pulse of a Governor that is concerned about the health and welfare of Rivers people. “Since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, Governor Wike has done so much to show his love for his people. “The buses will pick and drop passengers only at designated bus stops and will operate from 6:30 am to 7 pm daily,” Ejekwu said. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria is 10,578, according to the NCDC.

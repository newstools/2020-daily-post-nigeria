The Federal Government has clarified that President Muhammadu Buhari is not planning to absorb some N-Power volunteers into the Federal Civil Service on June 12. This was cleared in a statement signed by the Deputy Director, Information of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Rhoda Iliya, on Saturday. Iliya described the rumours making the rounds as “fake news”. “The attention of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, has been drawn to the fake news trending on social media that President Muhammadu Buhari will on June 12 broadcast to the nation the absorption of N-Power Batch A Volunteers into the Federal Civil Service,” part of the statement read. It called on the public to disregard the information, as any information about N-Power or the National Social Investment Programme will be sent out via the appropriate Federal Government channels.

Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has opened up on the things that stood his way ahead of a move to the club in January this year. The 30-year-old signed an initial six-month loan deal with the Old Trafford outfit in the winter window. Ighalo, whose parent club Chinese Super League is Shanghai Shenhua, this week extended that deal until January 2021. In an interview with Sky Sports, Ighalo spoke about his journey to playing for the club he supported as a boy and why he pulled all stops to extend his contract with the Red Devils. “I was playing in Shanghai. That was against me. Would a club as a big as United be looking in China for a striker? That was against me. My age. That was against me. There was a pandemic in China. That was against me. I said no this is a joke. Later when it got serious, I thought only when I fly to Manchester will I believe it,” he said. Ighalo has scored four goals in eight appearances so far for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men.

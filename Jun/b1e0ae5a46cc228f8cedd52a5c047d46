The Federal Government has announced that more Nigerians will return home from America on July 4. They will take off July 3 via the second special flight for citizens stranded due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Nigerian Consulate in New York said this in a statement on behalf of the Nigerian Missions in the U.S, NAN reports. The evacuees will depart the Newark Liberty International Airport, New Jersey, aboard an Ethiopian Airlines plane. They are expected to arrive at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos. The consulate stated that only those free of COVID-19 and with body temperatures below 38 degrees centigrade would be allowed to board the plane. It said in accordance with the Nigerian Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, all evacuees must present an original COVID-19 negative test result (not older than 14 days) at the airport of departure. They must also undergo a temperature check four hours before departure. “Any intending evacuee without the stipulated test result, or with a body temperature above 38 degrees centigrade, or any symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, will not be allowed to check in. “While onboard, all prospective evacuees are required to be in possession of a hand sanitiser for intermittent use throughout the journey and wear face masks,” the consulate said. Prospective travelers will be subject to instructions of Port Health Services (PHS), officials and entry screening protocols on arrival in Nigeria. No fewer than 700 Nigerians registered with the missions in the U.S. for evacuation. On May 10, the first batch of 160 Nigerians returned home aboard a special Ethiopian Airline flight arranged by the government.

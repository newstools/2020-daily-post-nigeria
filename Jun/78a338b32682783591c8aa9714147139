Former Manchester United defender, Paul Parker, has urged attacking midfielder, Jesse Lingard, to leave the club for Inter Milan this summer’s transfer window. Lingard has fallen out of favour under Red Devils manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, so far this season. The England international is behind Paul Pogba, Bruno Fernandez, Fred, Scott McTominay and Juan Mata in Solskjaer’s pecking order of midfielders. Parker told Eurosport: “One player who may be moving on is Jesse Lingard. “He is on the periphery now. Once he was delivering for club and country, and he became big news. “But now when he gets his chances, and he cannot stand out and lead a group of young players, and nor do senior colleagues help him raise his game. “He’s in a rut, and now he’s signed up with Mino Raiola, and he’s probably looking to get abroad. “He could go to Italy to re-establish himself, perhaps at Inter Milan.”

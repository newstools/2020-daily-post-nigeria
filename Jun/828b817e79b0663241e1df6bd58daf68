Kenneth Imasuagbon, one of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governorship aspirants in Edo State has said greater obstacles await Godwin Obaseki at the upcoming primary election. Imasuagbon said Obaseki would be defeated during PDP’s primary election scheduled to hold on Thursday. Appearing on TVC, the governorship aspirant said the primary election was between godfathers and delegates. He said: “I’m going to win, Obaseki will be beaten. Tomorrow’s race is between the godfathers and the delegates. “I have told my delegates to be strong and be of good courage, democracy must be defended from those willing to kill it. Democracy is about ideas, straying in the game and fraternizing with the people. “Democracy is not about godfathers saying this is their choice, it’s not going to work that way.” Imasuagbon had earlier, in a statement refuted reports of stepping down for Obaseki, ahead of the party’s primary election.

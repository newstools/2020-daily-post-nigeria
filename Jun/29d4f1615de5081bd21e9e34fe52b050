Arsenal lost 3-2 to Brentford on Wednesday, in their second friendly game ahead of the Premier League restart next week. The Gunners took the lead in the first half through a Joe Willock goal. However, the Championship side struck three times after the break thanks to goals from Tariqe Fosu, Halil Dervisoglu and Shandon Baptiste, to stun Mikel Artetaâ€™s men. Alexandre Lacazette pulled one back for Arsenal, but it was not enough to prevent the North London side from losing. The Gunners had overpowered Charlton Athletic 5-0 in another friendly played last week at the Emirates. Arsenal travel to Manchester City on June 17 as the top flight resumes.

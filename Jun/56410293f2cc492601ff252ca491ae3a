National President of Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union, COEASU, Comrade Nuhu Ogirima, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari, has performed badly in the area of education. He said this in a chat with newsmen while assessing Buhari’s five years in office. Ogirima expressed disappointment over Buhari’s failure to live up to expectations despite several promises. He particularly lamented the “neglect” of Colleges of Education, stressing that such portends serious implication for the country’s education system. Ogirima said: “Virtually all the problems he met upon assumption of office five years ago in the area of education have remained unresolved. The assessment report for Colleges of Education is yet to be implemented. “Other agreements and promises made have not been fulfilled. Matters concerning education have not got the kind of attention they deserve. Education is the bedrock for economic growth; the most important resource for human development. It should be a top priority”. The COEASU leader advised Buhari to declare a state of emergency in the sector to squarely deal with the numerous challenges bedeviling the sector. This, he noted, has been the call by many Nigerians and stakeholders. “Declaration of state of emergency in education is simply the way to go if we want to holistically solve the problems militating against the progress of our education sector. “We must ignore protocols to effectively tackle the enormous challenges confronting Nigeria’s education sector. That is why a state of emergency declaration is very important,” Ogirima added.

President Muhammadu Buhari has called on local and federal authorities to provide assistance to victims of the fire incident in Oba Market, Benin City, Edo State. This was contained in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu. DAILY POST reported earlier that it was a disastrous scenario at the early hour of Monday as fire gutted the popular Benin Monarch market close to the palace of the Oba of Benin Kingdom. Eyewitness, who pleaded not to be mentioned, told DAILY POST that all efforts to reach the State Fire Service proved abortive as the state owned fire agency complained of not having enough water and fuel at their disposal. Buhari said, “Our thoughts and prayers are with those who lost their shops and wares.’’ The statement said the President also directed an investigation into the cause of the inferno, in order to avoid the “horrific’’ situation in the future, while condoling with all those that were affected.

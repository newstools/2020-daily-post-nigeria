He noted that the committee is “mandated to screen all aspirants for the upcoming 2020 governorship election in Edo.” On the committee are Kingsley Chinda as Chairman, Boyele Debekeme as Secretary, Oladimeji Fabiyi, Joy Emordi and Aishat Hasindu as members. PDP had on June 5 conducted a screening exercise for some aspirants. The party had granted waiver to Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shuaibu. This means Obaseki is part of those to be screened. The part also shifted its primary election from June 23 to June 25.

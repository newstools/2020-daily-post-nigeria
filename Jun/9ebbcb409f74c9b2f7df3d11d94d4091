The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU has asked the Federal Government to constitute a new Governing Council for the University of Port Harcourt without further delay. UNIPORT chapter Chairman of ASUU, Dr. Austen Sado made the demand in a statement circulated in the media. Dr. Sado said the University Act does not allow any university to operate in a vacuum, adding that UNIPORT has been plagued with several administrative challenges as a result of the alleged “high-handedness of the outgoing Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ndowa Lale not limited to the award of contracts, staff welfare and discipline”, and so on. In the meantime, reports say the Deputy Vice-Chancellor in charge of Administration (DVC Admin), Professor Regina Ogali has been appointed the acting Vice-Chancellor of the University of Port Harcourt as the outgoing VC, Prof. N. Lale proceeds on compulsory leave on June 12.

The Plateau State Government has announced that 29 of its health workers have contacted the coronavirus disease. The Commissioner for Health, Dr. Nimkong Lar, made the disclosure at a press briefing on Wednesday in Jos. Lar said the state has recorded 198 COVID-19 confirmed cases, with 114 patients discharged and five deaths. “COVID19 Update, the NCDC says Plateau has 168 confirmed cases but results released now confirms we have 198 cases,’’ he said. According to him, a private hospital in the state was shut down for two weeks, following its exposure to two coronavirus patients, who were managed for other health conditions. He also said that 17 staff of the hospital were confirmed with the virus, while all staff of the hospital have been quarantined. “We decontaminated the hospital yesterday and have shut it down for public safety. “We have also taken the 17 staff to the isolation centers for treatment,’’ he added. He further stated that the Commissioner for Information and Communication, Dan Manjang, has urged the residents of the states to adhere to the compulsory use of face in public areas. The commissioner lamented the lack of adherence to social distancing and non-provision of water, soap, and sanitizers at the entrances of public places had caused a greater risk of contracting the disease. “Anyone found to be violating the COVID-19 guidelines will be arrested and prosecuted, while such public places will be shut down,’’ the commissioner stated. He also said that monitoring teams have been put in place to enforce compliance, NAN reports.

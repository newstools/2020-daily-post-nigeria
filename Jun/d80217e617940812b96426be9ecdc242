The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mr. Ibrahim Magu, has attributed the rising successes of the commission in the anti-corruption fight to the political will of President Muhammadu Buhari’s government. The EFCC boss disclosed this in a statement signed by Mr. Dele Oyewale, the Commission’s spokesperson, on Thursday after a World Press Conference to mark the 2020 Democracy Day and Anti-corruption Summit. Magu attributed EFCC’s success to the present government, which allows for non-interference in its works and zero tolerance for any act of corruption. He said: “The political will we have enjoyed from the current government in the fight against corruption is unprecedented. “The president allows the EFCC to operate without interference, and this has been one of our biggest strengths.” He added: “We have recovered a large array of non-monetary assets like properties, estates, private jets, oil vessels, filling stations, schools, hotels, trucks, automobiles, jewellery, plaza, shopping malls, electronics, amongst others.”

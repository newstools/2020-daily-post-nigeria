Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has hailed the impact former Super Eagles midfielder, Jay Jay Okocha, made in Bundesliga. Klopp, speaking with the UK Guardian, claimed Okocha scored the most spectacular goal in the history of German football. The former Borussia Dortmund boss was referring to Okocha’s dazzling strike in the 1992/1993 season, when he featured for Frankfurt against Karlsruher. The Nigerian legend danced his way past many defenders and the legendary Oliver Kahn in goal, before slotting home. It was later voted as the Goal of the Season by several football publications. “Okocha scored the most spectacular goal in the history of German football,” Klopp said. “It took like five minutes of Kahn and his defenders diving on the floor before he put the ball in the net.” El Hadji Diouf reveals most talented, best footballer in Africa John Fashanu reveals why Chelsea’s Tammy Abraham chose England over Nigeria EPL: Klopp not happy with Liverpool's 2-0 win over Manchester United

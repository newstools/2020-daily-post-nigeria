Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN), Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari’s acceptance of an emergency National Executive Council, NEC, meeting summoned by embattled Deputy National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Victor Giadom. Sagay appealed to Buhari not to attend the NEC meeting scheduled for Thursday (today). Giadom had called for a NEC meeting in resolving the leadership crisis currently rocking the APC. Against this backdrop, Buhari had said the law backs Giadom to replace Adams Oshiomhole as National Chairman of the party. This followed Giadom’s decision that he was Oshiomhole’s replacement after being suspended by an Appeal Court. However, Sagay stressed that Giadom lacked the power to summon a NEC meeting because a deputy national secretary was not in line to succeed the party’s national chairman. Sagay told the Nation: “I’m stunned by this turn of events. How can a deputy national secretary have the ambition to be the chairman of a party when you have deputy chairmen and vice-chairmen? “That is why it is absurd. It does not make sense. His position makes it impossible for him to be the acting national chairman. “The legal advice the President got is mischievous in the extreme because there is no court order to extend since it does not exist. “So I would advise the President to step back from this matter and not participate in it.”

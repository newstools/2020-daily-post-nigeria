At least four persons are said to have been killed in three villages in the Manta District in a renewed armed bandits attack in Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger state. Aside from this, some of the villagers allegedly sustained injuries, others are still missing and cattle rustling. The bandits DAILY POST gathered stormed the communities on motorcycles, shooting sporadically in the air at about 4pm on Wednesday, and unleashed terror on the people. The communities affected include Sunko, Gavya, Marafa in Manta District in the council area. When contacted, the Co-convener of Concerned Shiroro Youths, Sani Abubakar Yusuf Kokki confirmed the attack, saying the effects of the coordinated and premeditated attacks were devastating and mind-boggling. According to him, four people were killed, some sustained injuries kidnapped and properties lost in the coordinated attacks by the bandits. ” Among the four people gruesomely gunned down includes a woman who was fleeing to a nearby island for fear of her life but she couldn’t escape as she was eventually shot with a gun from a far distance and she died on the spot. Many sustained injuries. Apart from human losses, many properties worth huge amounts of money were stolen, many herds of cattle were rustled.” Kokki hinged the incessant attacks on Shiroro local government without much resistance to the lack of the presence of security agencies in the area. My people continually live in fear daily and we are scared of what will come next because attacks of this nature have become regular occurrences in substantial parts of Shiroro local government in Niger State.” However, efforts to get confirmation from the Niger State Police Command through the state Public Relations Officer, ASP. Wasiu Abiodun proved abortive.

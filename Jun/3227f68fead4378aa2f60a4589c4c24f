He also said that the membership of ECOSOC is important to Nigeria, due to the fact that the council is a very strategic organ of the UN. ”Under the UN Charter, it is responsible for promoting higher standards of living, employment, and economic and social progress. ”The council also identifies solutions to international economic, social and health problems, and facilitates international cultural and educational cooperation, among others,” he added. Itegboje said as a member of the council, Nigeria would be better placed to advance not only its interests but those of Africa as a whole.

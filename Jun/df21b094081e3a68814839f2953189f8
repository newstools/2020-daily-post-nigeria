Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said that the club will find out the extent of Bernd Leno’s injury in the coming days. Leno went down holding his knee, following a collision with Neal Maupay in the first half of their 2-1 defeat at Brighton on Saturday. The German goalkeeper was replaced by Emi Martinez, who went on to concede the two goals. There are fears that Leno could now miss the rest of the season, but speaking to BT Sport after the game, Arteta said it was too early to tell how serious the injury is. “It doesn’t look good but we don’t know anything yet. It is too far from me, I haven’t seen the actions. “I always believe players don’t have intentions to injure people and I am sure he did not intend to do that,” Arteta said.

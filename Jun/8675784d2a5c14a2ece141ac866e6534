The Action Democratic Party (ADP) has said it is ready to accept the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, “with open arms” if he decides to defect to the party. ADP’s National Publicity Secretary, Adelaja Adeoye, stated this in an interview with NAN in Lagos. Adeoye was reacting to Obaseki’s disqualification by the Screening Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), which means the governor will not be part of the party’s primaries on June 22. He, however, made it clear that Obaseki will not be handed an automatic ticket but will slug it out with other aspirants. “We will expect the governor to follow laid-down rules and abide by the principles of the party should he decide to join us to seek our ticket. “We will also expect him to slug it out with governorship aspirants in the party to get the ticket. He will definitely enjoy some privileges as a sitting governor. We will accord him all the respect,” Adeoye said. ADP is yet to conduct its governorship primaries, which means the window of opportunity was there for Obaseki to join and seek the party’s ticket.

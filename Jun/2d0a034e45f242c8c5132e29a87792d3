Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), have congratulated their Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki, for emerging the governorship candidate of the party in the September 19 poll. This was contained in a letter signed by the chairman of the PDP Governors’ Forum, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, on Friday. Tambuwal in the letter said that Obaseki’s victory in the primaries proved that the people of Edo State support the Governor. According to Tambuwal, “This victory should be a humbling one as it has been achieved on the backdrop of a grave injustice done to him by his former political party, the APC and a demonstration of the role of God in the affairs of men. “It is indeed a call to continue faithfully serving the good people of Edo State.” Obaseki had a free run towards clinching the ticket, polling 1,952 votes, out of the total accredited 2,024. A total of 72 votes were invalid.

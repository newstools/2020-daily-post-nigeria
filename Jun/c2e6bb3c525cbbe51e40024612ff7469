According to Dr. Aliyu, “Some businesses which flouted COVID-19 guidelines have been sanctioned or fined. “We would not sit back and allow public safety to be endangered by a few people.” He noted that the lockdown was relaxed “not because COVID-19 has gone but to ensure the economy does not collapse. “The fact that we are getting many reports on the flouting of the COVID-19 guidelines is a cause for concern,” he said.

The Rivers State Police Command has concluded plans to begin demolition of hundreds buildings belonging to police personnel in the state. The police authority in the state referred to the buildings as illegal structures erected on police lands. The notice of demolition dated June 3 and addressed to all officers of buildings at Nimi Okoro police station in Port Harcourt and signed by the police provost Marshall for the state Commissioner of Police. The document tagged, Notice of Removal of Illegal Structures on the Nigeria Police Land, Rivers State Command, relied on a signal issued in 2004 by the then inspector-general of police. The demotion notice said: “Your attention is hereby drawn to IGP’s 2004 circular in respect of the illegal structure you built on government land without approval. “However, the Commissioner Police in his final magnanimity has given you till 5th June 2020 to voluntarily remove the illegal structures. “Take note that the building will be forcefully demolished after this ultimatum whether you are present or not. You are advised in your own interest to remove it to avoid embarrassment.” But the affected policemen said they had no other place to go and begged the police authority to either reconsider the demolition plan or provide accommodation for them.

A Federal High court sitting in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital, has restrained the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki from participating in the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governirship primary election. One of the party’s aspirants, Omoregir Ogbeide-Ihiama had approached the court asking for the Governor, who just joined the PDP from the All Progressives Congress, APC, to be stopped from participating in the primaries. Omoregir Ogbeide-Ihama argued that since Obaseki was not part of the candidates screened by the PDP National Working Committee, NWC initially before the date on the timetable lapsed, he should not be allowed to participate in the primaries. The Port Harcourt High Court, presided over by Hon. Justice E. A. Obile, hence granted Ogbeide-Ihama’s prayer. Obaseki had last week joined the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP officially. He was later granted a waiver by the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP has granted to contest in their governorship election primary.

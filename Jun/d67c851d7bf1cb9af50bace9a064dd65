President Muhammadu Buhari has said democracy in Nigeria is under threats due to COVID-19 pandemic. The President, during his nationwide broadcast, said despite bad effect of the pandemic, his administration had taken recognition of the COVID-19 crisis as a motivation to develop a nationwide public health care system to help overcome and prepare for any future pandemic. Giving update on COVID-19 in Nigeria, Buhari added that the ease of lockdown in the country was to ensure a balance between lives and livelihoods. “I receive regular briefing from the PTF on COVID-19. The National Response during this time relies on science, Data and Experience in taking decisions. “This informed the approval for the ease of lockdown phase to ensure a balance between lives and livelihoods. “As we celebrate 2020 Democracy Day, fellow Nigerians let us remember that, notwithstanding our aspirations, humanity and indeed democracy is under the threat of COVID-19. “I am confident that the steps being taken by the PTF would result in flattening the COVID-19 curve. “Government is determined to turn this COVID-19 challenge into a motivation to action by building a nation-wide public health care system that will help us overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for any future outbreak.” Buhari further charged inventors, researchers and scientists to come up with solutions to cure COVID-19, even as he urged Nigerians to obey approved guidelines and protocols. “There is hope for us all if we take individual and collective responsibility,” he said. The President, however, encouraged Nigerians to be confident as the nation will survive the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other many crises before.

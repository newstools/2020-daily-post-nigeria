The Ebonyi State Police Command on Thursday said that gunmen abducted two Chinese expatriates working in a mining site in Ihietutu, Ishiagu in Ivo Local Government A of Ebony State. The Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO) Mrs Loveth Odah, who confirmed the incident to NAN said the abducted Chinese nationals are employees at Greenfield Metals Nigeria Limited which specializes in lead and zinc mining. She explained that the victims were allegedly abducted on Wednesday, and the police were yet to establish the motive behind the abduction. Odah added that preliminary investigation had commenced. “We got the information yesterday, a detachment of our tactical team was despatched to the area with a view to unraveling the true situation and also to rescue the victims. “The team is yet to return to furnish us with relevant information about the incident. She also said that the abductors are yet to contact the company for ransom. Odah, therefore, advised non-Nigerian Nationals to move out with armed security guards to prevent attacks and molestation from criminals or abduction.

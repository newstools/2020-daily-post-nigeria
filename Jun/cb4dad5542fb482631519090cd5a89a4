The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has reacted to the dissolution of the All Progressives Congress, APC, National Working Committee, NWC. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan said APC’s future lies in legal matters. In a tweet, Ologbondiyan said the crisis in APC was the beginning of the end of a nightmare for Nigerians. “The future @OfficialAPCNg, if any, rests in the anatomy of legal jurisprudence in the courts. For Nigerians, it is the beginning of the end of a nightmare,” he tweeted. APC’s leadership crisis began with the suspension of Adam Oshiomhole as National Chairman of the party. This led to the party’s NWC appointing former Oyo Governor, Abiola Ajimobi as Acting National Chairman of the party. However, the party’s Deputy National Secretary, Victor Giadom disapproved of Ajimobi’s appointment, insisting that he was Oshiomhole’s successor. With the backing of President Muhammadu Buhari, Giadom on Thursday convened a National Executive Council, NEC, meeting where APC’s NWC was dissolved. At the meeting, Buhari also urged aggrieved members to suspend all legal actions against each other in court.

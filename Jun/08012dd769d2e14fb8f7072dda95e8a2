The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has declared as fraudulent, the operations of a twitter handle @YusufPhilipYila, purported to belong to the Bank’s Director, Development Finance Department, Philip Yila Yusuf. On Monday, CBN Director of Corporate Communications, Isaac Okorafor, said the impostor handle has been posting messages related to the Bank’s N50 billion Targeted Credit Facility (TCF). He noted that the scammer was doing this with the intent of wooing unsuspecting loan seekers and owners of small-scale businesses. Okorafor warned unsuspecting members of the public not to have any dealings with the said twitter handle. The spokesman said although the CBN, through the NIRSAL Microfinance Bank (NMFB), has disbursed loans to successful beneficiaries under its COVID-19 TCF, none of the Bank’s officials engages in direct interactions with prospective or successful applicants. “We, therefore, find it embarrassing that Mr. Yusuf has continued to be inundated with personal calls relating to messages from the impostor handle”, he added. Okoroafor advised prospective applicants not to fall for scams and go through official channels.

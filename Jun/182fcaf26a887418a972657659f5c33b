Tyson Fury, Current World heavyweight champion, has insisted that American boxer, Deontay Wilder, is still the second-best heavyweight in the world ahead of British fighter, Anthony Joshua. The 31-year-old became a two-time world heavyweight champions after defeating Wilder in Las Vegas last February. Fury and Wilder are set to fight again for a trilogy fight later this year before the Gypsy King will contest against Joshua in 2021 to crown the undisputed heavyweight world champion. Joshua currently holds the IBF, WBA and WBO belts, but Fury believes his fellow British is below Wilder’s level. “Deontay Wilder is the second-best heavyweight in the world,” Fury told Queensbury Promotions YouTube channel. “I believe he knocks Anthony Joshua out and everyone behind me. “Everybody else out there, I think he knocks them out because me being a master boxer and people think ‘just go forward on Deontay Wilder now you knock him out’.”

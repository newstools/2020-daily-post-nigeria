The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered an investigation into the alleged rape and murder of Vera Uwaila Omozuwa, a 100-level Microbiology student of the University of Benin, UNIBEN.

Reacting in a statement, Adamu while assuring that the perpetrators will be brought to book, deployed more investigative aids to Edo State.

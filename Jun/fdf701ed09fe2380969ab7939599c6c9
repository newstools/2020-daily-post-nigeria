Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, may call on Victor Moses to help the team out if an emergency happens, the Daily Mail reports. Moses is currently on loan at Inter Milan from the Blues. The former Super Eagles winger signed a loan deal with the Serie A side until June 30, 2020. Players such as Moses, Alexis Sanchez, and Chris Smalling who are returning on loan, will be blocked from Premier League action, but will only be allowed to play in an emergency. “We’ve been told it will take a situation where the goalkeeper has to play center-forward or the center-forward has to go in goal for these players to be allowed to play. “A lot of players will be in limbo over the next couple of months and will probably have to train at home for a period,” the report said. Moses has been training with his Inter teammates, ahead of the Coppa Italia clash against Napoli on Saturday, June 13.

The Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, has warned Nigerians to take responsibility in the next phase of the lockdown relaxation. Ehanire stated this on Tuesday, while speaking at the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 daily briefing. The Minister emphasised the importance of adhering strictly to all health protocols, so that COVID-19 “does not spike or bounce off, as it has been observed in many countries where lockdown was relaxed.” On Monday, President Muhammadu Buhari lifted the ban on religious gatherings and announced new curfew time. Buhari also approved new working hours for civil servants and banks. Nigeria currently has 10,578 confirmed cases of coronavirus.

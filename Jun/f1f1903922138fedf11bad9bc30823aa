Chelsea is ready to sell at least four players this summer, as it looks to oversee a huge squad overhaul ahead of next season. According to The Times, Chelsea wants to raise funds by offloading some of its defenders, Marcos Alonso, Emerson Palmieri, Kurt Zouma and Andreas Christensen this summer. Frank Lampard’s side is keen to sign Leicester City left-back, Ben Chilwell this summer’s transfer window. Chilwell has been heavily linked with a move to Stamford Bridge at the end of the season. Meanwhile, former Chelsea defender, Ashley Cole, has since advised the club to prioritise a move for Chilwell this summer. “I would love to see Chilwell here,” Cole told talkSPORT. I think he’s a quality player. “I have heard he’s a Chelsea fan so yes I would like to see him here. It is a big decision for the club, but quality-wise for sure he is good enough.”

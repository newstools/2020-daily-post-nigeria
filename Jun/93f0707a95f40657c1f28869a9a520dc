The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has reiterated that athletes are still banned from protesting at the Olympic Games, SportingLife reports. This follows the decision of other sports, to allow protests following George Floyd’s death in police custody. Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter states “no kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda is permitted in any Olympic sites, venues or other areas.” This means that athletes who breach the rule will be disciplined. The IOC had issued guidelines in January this year, banning protests include taking a knee and other gestures. Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died after a white Minneapolis policeman kneed into his neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25. His death sparked protests globally against racial injustice, with several soccer players in Germany’s Bundesliga delivering their own messages of support during games.

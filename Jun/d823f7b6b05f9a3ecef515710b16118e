Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has defended David de Gea following his howler in their 1-1 draw at Tottenham Hotspur on Friday night. De Gea failed to keep out Steven Bergwijn’s powerful out, as Spurs took a 1-0 lead in the first half. However, United were able to snatch a point, after Paul Pogba was fouled inside the penalty area. Bruno Fernandes stepped up to slam the ball past Hugo Lloris. Former United captain, Roy Keane, labelled De Gea as “most overrated goalkeper” ever following the error. But Solskjaer fired back, claiming the ball changed direction. “David is a disappointed obviously with it but the ball was moving through the air,’ said the United boss. “We reacted well and he had a good save about five minutes after. When he saved that at least we were in the game until half-time,” he told Sky Sports.

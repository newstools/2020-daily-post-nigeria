Ghana’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Integration has condemned the demolition of a building owned by the Nigerian High Commission by alleged “unknown persons”. Nigeria says it is engaging Ghana over the incident. The apartments under construction were demolished on Friday. They were to serve as quarters for staff and visiting diplomats to the High Commission. In a statement, the ministry assured that it would go after perpetrators of the act. Ghana noted that what occurred was in breach of the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations. The country said “unidentified individuals had allegedly breached the premises of the Nigerian High Commission in Accra and demolished its property under construction around 10.30am, on Friday June 19, 2020″. “Accordingly, investigations are ongoing to unravel facts of the matter and bring the perpetrators to book.”. The statement added that the government of Ghana “has beefed up security at the said facility and the situation is under control”. The West African nation assured the diplomatic community that it remains a law-abiding country that upholds the principle of the rule of law.

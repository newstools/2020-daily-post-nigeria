The Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Federal Road Maintenance Agency FERMA Hon. Femi Bamisile says Ekiti State and Nigeria as a whole will miss the wealth of experience of the former Governor of old Ondo State, late Evang. Bamidele Olumilua A family source early on Thursday said Evang. Olumilua died at his House in Ikere Ekiti at the age of 80. Hon. Bamisile in a press release made available to newsmen in Ado Ekiti described the death of the Elder Statesman as a colossal loss to the society. Chief Olumilua was a forthright, disciplined, God-fearing and patriotic Nigerian hero who had contributed his quota to the development of Ekiti State and Nigeria as a whole. The Federal Lawmaker also described the late former governor as one of the stabilising factors of the APC Elders’ Forum in Ekiti State with unbiased judgemental tendency. Some of the landslide achievements of chief Olumilua’s regime as a governor of Old Ondo State between January 1992 and November 1993 are testimony to his selfless service to the society. While commiserating with the family of the deceased, Ekiti People, Dr. Kayode Fayemi and Nigeria as a whole, Hon. Bamisile prayed God to grant the late Politician an eternal rest. He, however, charged his immediate family to take solace in God and also ensure that the legacy, especially the good name left behind by the octogenarian is protected at all times.

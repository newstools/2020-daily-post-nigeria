Chelsea has officially signed a new five-year contract with midfielder, Tino Anjrin. Tino, 18, made his Chelsea’s debut in their Carabao Cup victory against Grimsby Town last September. Chelsea disclosed this in a statement on its official website on Monday. The statement read: “Tino Anjrin has committed his long-term future to Chelsea with the signing of a new five-year contract following his senior breakthrough this season. “The 18-year-old made his Blues debut in our big Carabao Cup victory against Grimsby Town in September and also featured as a substitute in our most recent Premier League outing, March’s 4-0 win over Everton at Stamford Bridge. “He is top goalscorer this season for our development squad, who were unbeaten and top of the league before the curtailment of the Premier League 2 campaign, and has captained our Under-18s as they reached the FA Youth Cup semi-finals.” Speaking after signing the new deal, Tino told the club’s official website: “It’s a brilliant feeling. “I have been at the club since I was six-years-old so to get to this stage and then be offered another five-year contract on top of that is amazing. “I had no hesitation but to take it straight away because to play for the club I always dreamed of playing for is really special for me.”

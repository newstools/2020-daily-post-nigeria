Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State has given reasons he will not seek an elective position at the end of his second term in office in 2023. Masari explained that he would have turned 73 years old by the time he finished his second tenure as governor, adding that he did not need to heed the call to vie for the position of a senator. Masari said this while briefing newsmen as part of his goodwill message to mark “Democracy Day” in Katsina on Friday. “After my tenure, I will sit at home and rest and leave the younger generation to continue playing politics. “I never thought I would join politics; I was a technical man in the civil service and rose to managerial level and was later appointed commissioner two times. “Later, people mobilized and pushed me to contest for the House of Representatives, which I won and even became the Speaker of the House. “I don’t think I still need anything again; I am in politics because of Allah’s design, and I have gained a lot of experience in life,” he said.

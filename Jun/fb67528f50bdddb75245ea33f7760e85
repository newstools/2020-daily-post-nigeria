The Ondo State House of Assembly has reacted to the allegation by the Deputy Governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi of plots to impeach him. Bamidele Oleyelogun, the Speaker of the assembly, told News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, on Tuesday, that the allegation of lawmakers collecting money to impeach Ajayi was baseless. Oleyelogun insisted that no lawmaker had been induced. “The statement is madness. There is nothing like that. Nobody has collected any Kobo to impeach anyone,” he said. Mr Tope Okeowo, the Deputy Chief Press Secretary, had earlier on Tuesday alleged that 26 lawmakers of the state House of Assembly collected N10 million each to “illegally”impeach the deputy governor. This was due to Ajayi’s decision to decamp from All Progressives Congress (APC) to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday.

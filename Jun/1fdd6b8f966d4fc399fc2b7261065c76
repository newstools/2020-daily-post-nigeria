England head coach, Gareth Southgate, has warned winger, Jadon Sancho, that transition to the English Premier League (EPL) would be a “challenge” for him amid interest from Manchester United. DAILY POST had reported that Sancho had drawn the interest of Man United in the past few weeks. Man United are ready to offer Sancho the no.7 shirt, in a bid to lure him to move to Old Trafford this summer’s transfer window. The Premier League giant is believed to be leading the race to sign Sancho from Dortmund for a club-record fee. Speaking on Sancho’s future, Southgate told Sky Sports: “Well he is a very talented young player, and that is clear. “He is developing well. As a young player if I look at his age, if I look at what his contribution is, he’s learning the game, he’s slowly maturing, there are still bits he has to learn, and he has got some fantastic role models in Raheem and Marcus Rashford to look at. “I think the top teams, the matches played at Champions League level where the English teams have played those German teams has been a good challenge. “I think the depth of the league isn’t as strong, and I think the finances aren’t the same. Our smallest teams can compete with some historical big hitters around Europe like Ajax.” Meanwhile, Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford, who is close friends with Sancho, has since welcomed the 20-year-old to Man United.

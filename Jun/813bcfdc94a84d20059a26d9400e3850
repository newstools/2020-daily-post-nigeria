Mr. Adaralegbe had explained the reason behind the slash in price of its land from N3.5m to N1.75m, offering 50 per cent discount by the company. According to Mr. Adaralegbe, the promo was done to encourage Nigerians to own their houses due to the effect of Coronavirus pandemic on the livelihoods of many Nigerians and also to complement government’s national housing plan considering the effects covid 19 pandemics on the economy. He noted that although T Pumpy has 22 housing estates and properties scattered across Kyami, Kasana, Kuje, Lugbe, Gwagwalada and other places in the nation’s capital, however, the ongoing promo is only exclusive to their property along the Airport Road. Speaking on the development, the CEO on Friday said the offer would end on June 30. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-802707 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200429-WA0011.jpg" alt="" width="1008" height="756" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200429-WA0011.jpg 1008w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/IMG-20200429-WA0011-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px"> In his words, “I have said this several times that one of my greatest passions is to see that every Nigerian own a house of his or her own. It is not all about business but a sincerity purpose to roofs over the heads of many Nigerians as much as I can assist. He said, “Imagine owning a standard 600sqm plot of a duplex, a penthouse or a bungalow for as low N1.75m. We are doing this because of the economic effects of the coronavirus on the people. “Of course you known it is every man’s dream to own a house and that is why T Pumpy Concept Limited wants to make sure to actualize that dream for them. “The market worth of the land is N3.5m but we are giving it out at this price just to encourage Nigerians at this critical time. Our lands are verifiable and authentic; they are government-approved. This promo will end on June 30. “We sell and develop all types of estate lands for residential, educational, commercial and recreational purposes. There are lands for bungalows, penthouses, duplexes, with corresponding land sizes and amount. Crèches/nursery school plots are also available. “Our expertise in building to the highest quality standards is evident throughout our complete line of estates. Our Estates are constructed in a factory environment and our building materials are never exposed to the elements and every aspect of the building process is closely monitored to ensure high-quality standards. “We also undertake feasibility and viability studies of real estate development projects.

Despite the relaxation of the hour of curfew by president Muhammadu Buhari from 8pm to 6am daily to 10pm to 4am, the Anambra State Government has announced that the Niger bridge will be shut at 7pm daily. A public announcement by the Anambra State Government stated that the reason was because of the closure of the Asaba end of the bridge by the Delta State government for a state-imposed curfew. The announcement, which was signed by Prof Solo Chukwulobelu, the Secretary to the Anambra State government said, “Anambra State government wishes to inform the public that effective today, Friday 5th June 2020, COVID-19 enforcement and security teams will be restricting traffic onto the Niger Bridge by 7pm until further notice. “This is as a result of operational curfew hours in place in Delta State which runs from 7pm to 6am. “Curfew in other parts of Anambra state is still from 10pm to 4am. All concerned are to take note please,” he said.

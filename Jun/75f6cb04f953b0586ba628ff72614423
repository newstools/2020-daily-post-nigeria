The Screening Appeal Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Saturday, upheld the disqualification of Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, from the party’s primary. The decision followed a review of a report submitted by the party’s screening committee. Chairman of the appeal panel, Dr. Abubakar Fari, who submitted the committee’s report to the Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee, also revealed that only one out of the three disqualified aspirants appealed the decision. “We looked at the grounds on which Obaseki was disqualified and I would like to say his disqualification was based on solid grounds,” Fari said. It also noted that the Governor also owned two separate voter cards which was illegal. The committee also said it found several inconsistencies in the forms Obaseki submitted. Apart from Obaseki, Chris Ogiemwonyi and Mathew Iduoriyekenwen were also disqualified by the APC. Mr Osaro Obaze, Dr Pius Odubu and Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu are the three aspirants cleared to take part in the primary on June 22.

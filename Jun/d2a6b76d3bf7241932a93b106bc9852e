Three suspected motorcycle thieves, who reportedly snatched a motorcycle from its owner were on Tuesday set ablaze by a mob in Ogoja, Northern Cross River. According to an eyewitness who gave his name as Felix and resides in the area, two of the okada thieves boarded a motorcycle at Igoli, centre of the Ogoja town and asked the rider to take them to Ndok junction, but along the way they snatched the motorcycle from him. “As the okada man was taking two of them to Ndok junction, on the way, they asked him to stop; another of their member who was waiting at a prearranged spot joined them and brought out a gun and threatened the okada man and he handed over to them the motorcycle,” Felix said According to Felix, as the thieves sped off, the okada man raised alarm and other okada riders pursued and caught up with the thieves. “One was caught with the okada near FRSC check point along the Ogoja – Ikom highway and dragged back to the junction where he was set on fire alive,” he said. He said the other two were smashed with sticks and stones to death but were not set ablaze following police intervention. Felix explained that it has been a regular practice for motorcycle thieves to go to the area and steal motorcycles. The Divisional Police Officer in the area, Mr Omeya said he was aware of the incident but cautioned that the Police Public Relations Officer is the “authorised person to speak to the press”. However, DSP Irene Ugbo, the PPRO for the state police command said she was yet to be briefed on the incident.

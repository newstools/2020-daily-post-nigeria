The Lagos State Safety Commission has begun registration of religious and social centres in the state, in preparation for full reopening. This is part of the Register-to-Open initiative of the state government, as directed by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. In a statement signed by its Director-General, Lanre Mojola, the commission said, “Further to the directive of Mr Governor with respect to the Register-to-Open initiative of Lagos State government, we hereby confirm that all religious and social centres (social clubs, event centres, restaurants, bars, night clubs, spas, cinemas and gyms) within the state can commence the registration process on the designated portal www.lasgsafetyreg.com immediately.” Sanwo-Olu, last month, said businesses would have to undergo re-registration before reopening. The Lagos State Safety Commission and Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA) would be visiting offices and business premises to assess the level of their readiness to resume operations. Lagos currently has the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria with 5,440.

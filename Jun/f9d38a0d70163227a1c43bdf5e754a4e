President Muhammadu Buhari says he is deeply shocked by the brutal killing of scores of people by the Boko Haram/Islam in West Africa Province (ISWAP) in Gubio village, Borno State. He has ordered the military to go after the terrorists. His reaction was contained in a statement Wednesday night by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu. Buhari said he is expecting a detailed briefing by Governor Babagana Zulum on the outcome of his visit to the affected communities. He noted that the “primordial nature of the killings is particularly shocking because it happened not long after the Ramadan and Eid, and the country is preparing to celebrate Democracy Day.” Buhari charged the armed forces to sustain “successes against the terrorists to extract a heavy price from the attackers”. The president directed them to bring back all those kidnapped as well as the large number of cattle rustled. He expressed condolences of the people of Nigeria to the bereaved families, communities and the government and people of Borno State.

The Action Democratic Party (ADP), on Monday called on the leadership of the upper and lower legislative arm to commit to passing bills that are meaningful to the lives of Nigerians. A statement issued by the National Publicity Secretary of the party, Prince Adelaja Adeoye, reminded the lawmakers to reflect on their legislative activities in the last one year to see if there were bills passed that directly addressed the needs of Nigerians. Adeoye advised the leadership of the National Assembly to prevail on President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the amended electoral act, 2019 in the interest of the nation. “We use this occasion to call on the National Assembly, all State Governors and Stakeholders across the country to ensure that the electoral act as (Amended), is assented to by President Buhari. “The National Assembly owes Nigerians a duty of selflessness, patriotism and integrity in the discharge of their duties. “As true representatives of the people, and as they journey into the second, third and fourth year of the 9th Assembly, they should help Nigerians with life-changing bills.” The party further enjoined the parliament to rescue the nation through legislative means from further economic woes occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic.

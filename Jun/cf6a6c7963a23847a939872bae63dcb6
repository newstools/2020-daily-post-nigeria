The Ogun State Police Command on Tuesday paraded 35 persons, who were arrested for offences ranging from rape, armed robbery, murder, cultism and others. One of the suspects was a 28-year-old Goddey Robinson, who was arrested for allegedly raping a lady into coma and dumping her body into a ditch, thinking she had died. The incident, DAILY POST learnt, happened at Agbara, Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State. The lady was said to have resurrected after Robinson had left; he was said to have been rescued by people who heard her voice as she cried out from the pit. While parading the suspects, the state Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson, said the state will not be a safe haven for rapists. Ebrimson threatened that the command will deal decisively with anybody caught in the evil act. Speaking further, the Ogun police boss read riot acts to indigenes of the state who are in illegal possession of firearms. Ebrimson issued a two-week ultimatum to residents of the state in possession of unregistered firearms to surrender same or risk the wrath of the law.

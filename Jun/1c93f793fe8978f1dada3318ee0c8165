Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said he left Tammy Abraham on the bench for their 2-1 win at Aston Villa because he is trying to manage his squad efficiently. Abraham and Christian Pulisic were substituted for the Blues’ first game back after the COVID-19 break. Lampard opted to start with Willian and Olivier Giroud in attack, while Ruben Loftus-Cheek also made a return from his long-term injury. “It’s very important to let the players know that this is more than ever a squad game over this period. “Certainly nobody should get their head down at not starting. We’re going to have to make subs and we’re going to need impact off the bench,” Lampard told Sky Sports. Pulisic and Giroud scored for Chelsea, as they fought back from a goal down to take all three points.

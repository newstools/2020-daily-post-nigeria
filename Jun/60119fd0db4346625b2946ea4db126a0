Chelsea returned to action for the second time since the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Premier League to be put on hold, hammering QPR 7-1 in a friendly played on Sunday afternoon at Stamford Bridge. Billy Gilmour and Ruben Loftus-Cheek both grabbed a brace each in the big victory, which came just a few days after the Blues defeated Reading 1-0. Mason Mount, Willian, and Olivier Giroud also scored for Frank Lampardâ€™s side against the Championship side. All the 20 Premier League clubs have been given the all-clear to play friendlies ahead of the scheduled restart on June 17. Recall that the English top-flight league has been on suspension for almost three months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Chelsea, who are fourth on the Premier League table, are away to Aston Villa on June 21.

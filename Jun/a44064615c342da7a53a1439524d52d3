The victim, names withheld, recounted that the arrested pedophile sent her on an errand, “and asked me to go and buy N50 groundnut for him. And when I brought the groundnut, he dragged me inside his room, clamped his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. “After he finished, I was crying and bleeding with lots of pains. Some youths saw me and asked me a question. He wanted to run but was apprehended.” The mother of the child informed DAILY POST that “there were attempts by some persons to stop the prosecution of the violator of my child with money, and I am not interested.

The Super Eagles’ Head of Scouting and Technical Staff Welfare Manager, Tunde Adelakun, has spoken about his time with Jose Mourinho. At the time, Mourinho was at Chelsea and Adelakun says the Portuguese thought him the art of scouting. According to Adelakun, it is important to scout opponents in order to know their strengths and weaknesses, when preparing for national team matches. “It’s something that is fast gaining ground across the world. I remember that in 2005,2006, it was under Jose Mourinho when he was at Chelsea Football Club and I worked in the academy,” Adelakun told Channels Television. “And Jose Mourinho actually imbibed in us the art of scouting, he made us realize that there’s very little that you need to do on the pitch if you don’t know your opponents and if you don’t know the strengths of your players.”

The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu has banned football viewing centres from operating in the State. Akeredolu gave the order on Monday, while speaking at the weekly media chat at the Government House in Akure, the State capital. He expressed his displeasure at how the residents were flouting restriction orders and the subsequent increase in the cases of COVID-19 in the state. The Governor, however, made it clear his government would not relent in efforts to continue enforcing the restriction. “All Premiership football viewing centres are hereby banned from operations until further notice. All religious organisations are to further ensure stringent implementation of the agreed guidelines for worship. “All our earlier regulations about operations of the main and community markets will be revisited in which case law enforcement agencies and the Governor’s Task Force will ensure full enforcement,” Akeredolu said.

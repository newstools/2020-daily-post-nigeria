Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted he is “hurt” by Liverpool’s title win. The Reds have won the 2019/2020 campaign, following Chelsea’s 2-1 win at home against Manchester City on Thursday night. Solskjaer had told his players to use the feeling to spur them on to win trophies of their own. “First of all, any team that wins the championship and a Premier League deserve it and deserve credit, it’s a hard league to win. Well done to Jurgen and his players. “Every time you see anyone else lift the trophy it hurts. I reckon that’s the feeling of everyone associated with Manchester United — players and supporters. We want to get back to winning ways and that’s our challenge,” Solskjaer told a news conference via Zoom on Friday. United have not won the Premier League title in seven years. The last time the Red Devils won it was in 2013, in Sir Alex Ferguson’s last season in charge.

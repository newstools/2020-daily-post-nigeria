Four persons were reportedly killed while eight others are said to be critically injured after suspected Boko Haram insurgents attacked travelers along the Maiduguri-Damboa road in the northeast, Nigeria.

Local vigilante told DAILY POST that they have conveyed four corpses and eight injured persons to Maiduguri following the attack. According to a local vigilante, who identified himself as Mohammed Goni, the travelers attacked include some humanitarian workers. He, however, did not give much details. It could be recalled that a similar attack was carried out along Maiduguri – Monguno road, where a staff of the IRC an international non- governmental organisation was abducted. A top military officer, who did not want his name in print told DAILY POST that, ”it is not surprising to see such occurrence as being witnessed in Maiduguri after successive and successful military operations. According to him, the Nigerian military has done a lot in the clearance operations and the Chief of Army Staff was in Abuja where he briefed the President on the achievements of the military. “Therefore, when pockets of attack are seen afterward, it does not mean that the military did not do much.” He said.

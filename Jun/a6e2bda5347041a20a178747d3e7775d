Enyinnaya Abaribe, Senate Minority Leader, has lamented that elections have been turned into a “battlefront” since the All Progressives Congress, APC, assumed power. Abaribe made the comment while declaring that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, was ready to reclaim states previously under its governance. Addressing journalists after PDP’s caucus meeting in Abuja, the lawmaker insisted that the party was ready to take over Edo and Ondo States in the upcoming governorship elections. He disclosed that members of the party would be encouraged to capture both states during the gubernatorial election. The lawmaker explained that the step was to enable the PDP increase the number of states under its control across the country. September 19 and October 10 have been fixed for the governorship elections in Edo and Ondo States respectively. However, Abaribe while speaking said: “The PDP caucus met and considered matters that are germane to internal matters of the caucus. We also discussed matters related to the party and the recent congresses were held in all the states of the federation. “We also considered the fact that there would be elections in two states; Edo and Ondo states. We resolved that we will encourage our members in both states to be able to capture those states so we can increase the number of states under the PDP in Nigeria. “Every election under this new regime of the APC is turned into a battlefront, so I’m using battle language. The PDP is very ready to make sure that those states that were under PDP before will return to the fold.”

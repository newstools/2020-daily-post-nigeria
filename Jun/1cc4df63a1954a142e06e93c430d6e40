A member of the National Board of Trustees of the All Progressives Grand Alliance(APGA), and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of TONIMAS Oil and Gas Company, Onowu Anthony Enukeme is dead. This was made known in a press release by the National Chairman of APGA, Ozonkpu Victor Oye and forwarded to DAILY POST on Tuesday morning. The cause of the death of the prominent businessman and politician was not stated in the release. However, Ozonkpu Oye, while reacting described the late Enukeme as a rare gem who has sacrificed a lot for the economic and political development of Nigeria. The APGA chairman wrote, “The news hit me like a ballistic missile. I was dazed, shocked and thrown into mental fixation. How can he die like that? I queried. But no answer coming from anywhere. “As I wrote this short tribute my hand was trembling. Tonimas dead? I keep asking. It can’t be. My head swirling and my heart beating in quick succession. “A good man has joined the Saints. Since I met him it has been one good act or another recorded for him. He single handed built a church in his hometown, Neni; celebrated annual yam festival for his people, and gave generously to numerous church and philanthropic causes. “He loved APGA with passion. He attended our last National Convention in Awka where he was elected a BOT member. “Oh, Lord, my God! How do we bear this burden of the loss of one of our pillars? I can’t continue. I am losing balance. Let me wait till the reality sinks before I can do a more befitting tribute. APGA thrown into deep mourning”.

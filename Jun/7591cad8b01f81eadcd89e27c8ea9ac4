The Niger State Police Commissioner, Adamu Usman, has attributed the continued bandit attacks in parts of the state to the difficulty of terrains and lack of communication. He also disclosed that banditry, rape, cattle rustling and armed robbery are other challenges facing the Police in the state. Adamu Usman, who spoke with journalists at the premises of the Niger State House of Assembly shortly after a closed-door session with legislators, said some of the terrains are hard to reach by his men during attacks. The Commissioner was invited by the Assembly to explain why the continued banditry attacks in the state especially in the Niger East Senatorial zone. Disturbed by the incessant banditry attacks and rising tide of insecurity that pervades the state, it would be recalled that the House invited the Police Commissioner, the State Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello, Director, State Security Service and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) to come and explain why. He stated, ” The particular challenge we face are the difficult terrain and communication. There are some places that if you have to go, you have to go through Kaduna State. So the terrain is a problem, and also some of these communities have no network connection. So, if there is a problem, or before information gets to us, the bandits would have escaped.” The state Police boss promised that the Command will continue to do its best to ensure the attacks are permanently eliminated in the state. Usman, however, called for the cooperation of the Assembly in addressing the menace, arguing that as the representatives are closer to the people at the grassroots areas, they should oblige the Command with useful information. ” Security is everybody’s business, and the House of Assembly is a vital organ in confronting this challenge. They are closer to the people as their Representatives. So, they have a critical role to play,” he maintained.

The resignation letter was however made available to newsmen in Umuahia, on Tuesday afternoon. It quoted Ikoh as saying, “As a major financial stakeholder who has served the party(PDP) in various State and National assignments, I have always been sidelined in my ward, Local Government Area and State Party decisions”. “The recent Party Congress which produced two parallel structures in my local government area(Ikwuano), of which they are in court now, cannot advance the PDP. “In line with the above and many other anomalies, I see no future for me and my teeming supporters in the party, hence I tender my resignation from PDP with my teeming supporters”. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-801457 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FB_IMG_1591703761938.jpg" alt="" width="563" height="1000" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FB_IMG_1591703761938.jpg 563w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FB_IMG_1591703761938-169x300.jpg 169w" sizes="(max-width: 563px) 100vw, 563px">

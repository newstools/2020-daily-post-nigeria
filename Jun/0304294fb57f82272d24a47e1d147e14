The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Edo State chapter, Mr. Anslem Ojezua, has reacted to the confirmation by the management of the University of Ibadan (UI) that Obaseki, graduated from the institution in 1979 with a Second Class Honours, Lower Division. The Registrar, Mrs Olubunmi Faluyi, confirmed that Obaseki graduated from Ibadan where he studied Classics. Ojezua, reacting, said the clearance from UI has strengthened the integrity of Obaseki and shut the mouth of naysayers. Speaking to newsmen on Wednesday, in Benin, Ojezua said: “This is not a case of Toronto or Chicago. University of Ibadan is not a university that you just walk into and graduate. “It just takes about three hours from Benin to the university and verify if you are in doubt or visit the internet. “Shame on all those who have been witch-hunting Obaseki that he never graduated from the university,” Ojezua added On the relocation of APC secretariat in Edo, Ojezua said it was contempt of court to do so by the National Chairman and the other APC factional Chairman in the state, Col. David Imose (Rtd). “The new secretariat according to the national chairman is an illegal secretariat,” he said.

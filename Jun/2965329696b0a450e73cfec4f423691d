Deji Adeyanju, Convener of Concerned Nigerian, has said the North has used some top chieftains of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to make the South appear weak, ahead of 2023 presidential election. Adeyanju claimed that Northerners have politically used Bola Tinubu, APC National Leader, Godswill Akpabio and Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation. He said the North has used those mentioned to appear the South don’t have votes, ahead of 2023 presidential election. The activist also warned that without votes, the South has no “voice at the negotiation table.” “On 2023 presidency: The Northerners have used politically naive people like Akpabio, Amaechi and Tinubu to make the South appear they don’t have votes. “Without votes, you can’t have influential voice on the negotiation table,” he tweeted.

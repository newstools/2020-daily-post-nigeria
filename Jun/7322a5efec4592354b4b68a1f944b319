Four persons, including a pregnant woman, on Friday escaped death after a commercial bus plunged into a drainage in Kaduna due to over speeding. The commercial bus which conveyed passengers from Kaduna Central market, by Ahmadu Bello Way was in full-speed when it lost control and approached the popular Peugeot traffic junction, by the Television Garage, Kaduna. An eye witness, a police traffic officer, Sergeant Thomas Akuna told DAILY POST that the driver was lucky, because there was no oncoming vehicle in front or behind. “I watched carefully as the bus was coming with full speed from Kaduna north, and was going towards Gonin Gora in Chikun Local Government Area of the state. All of a sudden, I heard a loud sound.” Thomas said Also speaking, one of the passengers who identified herself as Mrs Rhoda Aligema said she went to Kaduna Central market gate to buy fish for resale. She said, while she was inside the bus, she kept advising the driver against over speeding, but he wouldn’t listen. “The way the driver was speeding, I kept telling him to reduce his speed. Even one of the back seat passengers told him to stop for him to come down if he continued with the speed, but the driver didn’t listen. “Well, I thank God for sparing my life. I am so happy that I have no bruise. May the name of God be glorified.” She played Though only two people sustained minor injuries, officials of Kaduna State Traffic and Environmental Law Enforcement ( KASTLEA) who were at the scene were already making frantic efforts to take the injured to a nearby hospital and evacuate the damaged bus from the scene. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-806392 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FB_IMG_1592570267035.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="457" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FB_IMG_1592570267035.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FB_IMG_1592570267035-300x190.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

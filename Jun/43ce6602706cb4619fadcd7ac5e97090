Aston Villa assistant manager, John Terry, has disclosed that Chelsea legend, Dennis Wise, grabbed him by the throat in front of former Blues teammates during their time together at Stamford Bridge. Terry said that he was 19 years old when the incident happened. According to him, Wise, who spent eleven years at Chelsea, was furious with him for buying a car and confronted him with the entire team watching. “I remember I was in the first team and got a Champions League bonus and I went out and stupidly bought a car with the bonus,” Terry told the Footballer’s Guide to Football podcast. “I was 19 years old at the time. “I came in with my car, and Wisey got me up around the throat in the corridor in front of everyone [teammates]: “Who do you think you are? Go and return the car”. “So he made me go and return the car back, which I lost money on, he then took me around and helped me find a house, buy a house, so it was the best bit of advice. “I was embarrassed at the time, but it was the best bit of advice that I could have had.”

The Cross River independent Electoral Commission (CROSIEC) on Tuesday presented a certificate of return to elected eighteen local government Council’s Chairmen and 196 ward Councillors in the just concluded LG elections. Speaking while presenting the certificates, the CROSIEC chairman, Dr. Mike Ushie charged the elected council officials to key into Governor Ben Ayade’s industrialization initiative. “Having been elected into offices as Chairmen and Councillors, you are assuming new responsibilities. I urge you to begin to see yourself as people with new responsibilities”. “Do not see yourself as ordinary citizens again but leaders who have just joined the league of leaders. You are no longer going to live for yourself alone but live for the people of your council and wards. “It’s on that basis that you must strive to work in tandem with the hope and aspirations of the state governor to lift the state to an enviable height,” Ushie said. However in his remarks, Council chairman-elect for Ikom Local Government Area, Mr. Kingsley Egumi promised to lead his council to greater heights, stressing that he would make life bearable for the people of his council area. Egumi urged all sons and daughters, opinion leaders from the council area irrespective of their party affiliations to join hands with him in moving the LGA forward. “The election that we won isn’t for me alone. The victory was for all of us and I solicit for all hands to be on deck to develop the council area.

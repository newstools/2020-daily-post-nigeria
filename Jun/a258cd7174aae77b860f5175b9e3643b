Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he is expecting Paul Pogba to “gradually improve” as he plays more with a few games left this season. Pogba has managed only eight appearances in all competitions this season, after undergoing ankle surgery in January. However, the Frenchman is fit and ready to play again, with United eyeing a place in the top four and silverware in the Europa League and FA Cup. The 27-year-old will however find plenty of competition for places after impressive performances from Bruno Fernandes, Nemanja Matic, Fred and Scott McTominay, that saw Solskjaer’s side go unbeaten in 11 games in all competitions before the COVID-19 break. “I want the same from Paul as from all the others. Paul is one of the best midfielders in the world so we expect him to gradually improve as he gets more and more game time. “Gradually over these next few months we can work him up back to his best. Paul has had a very good career. He is a World Cup winner and we want to have that leadership on the pitch as well,” Solskjaer told a Zoom press conference.

Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has charged Nigerians not to relent on the fight for true federalism. This was contained in his statement on the demise of rights activist and former Lagos Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Ayodele Akele. “The only way the death of our heroes would not be in vain is to continue the struggle for which heroes like Comrade Akele lived and died for”, he noted. Adams described Akele as a reliable and trusted ally that made remarkable impact in social activism. “I am saddened to hear the news of Akele’s death, it is a loss too many to bear. The late Comrade Akele’s foothold in social activism was indelible and we will certainly miss his radicalism”. The Aare stated that Akele was a frontline freedom fighter, “especially during the dark era of the military. He suffered a lot of injustice and yet remained steadfast in the struggle for justice and social reforms”. Noting that his relationship with the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) family was cordial, Adams said “Akele was nicknamed “Itu” and his popular saying was “Keu, Keu”, which had been his signpost among other Comrades” “I remember some of the memorable moments we shared. It reminded me of a brother, colleague and great man of high intelligence and integrity. Comrade Akele would never compromise on his principles and ideals”. Adams recalled that the deceased was “one of the few men that had earned my respect. He participated and showed unrivaled bravery during the Free Otunba Gani Adams (FOGAC) campaign that actually led to my release from detention.” The Yoruba leader prayed God to strengthen the family and give them the fortitude to bear the loss.

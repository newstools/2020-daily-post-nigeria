The Adamawa State Ministry for Women Affairs was on Tuesday afternoon gutted by fire. Part of the ministry, located at the state Secretariat Complex in the capital, Yola, was affected by the fire which sources said began about 1:30pm. Sources said officials of the ministry were displaced by the fire, which forced them in different directions as they sought safety away from the affected huge block housing the ministry. Fire service officials soon turned up, however, and had succeeded in putting out the fire just before late afternoon. An official of the ministry disclosed in confidence to Daily Post that the Commissioner of Women Affairs and Social Development, Mrs Lami Patrick, was in a meeting outside the ministry with the state governorâ€™s wife, Hajia Lami Fintiri, when the fire began. He said the cause of the fire was suspected to be electrical malfunctioning.

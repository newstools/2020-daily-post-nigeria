Deputy National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Abiola Ajimobi, has assumed the position of the Acting Chairman of the party. Ajimobi was appointed following the order of the Court of Appeal affirming the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole as National Chairman. Curiously, the former Senator has been away from the public since May. He is reportedly receiving treatment in a hospital in Lagos. However, the former Governor of Oyo State has urged stakeholders to “continue to observe peace”. Ajimobi made the call in a statement on Wednesday by his spokesman, Bolaji Tunji. Tunji said the Acting National Chairman, would soon call a meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC) “to resolve all contentious issues”. “We should, therefore, let peace continue to reign until we call the NEC meeting and take a position on the way forward”, he said. Ajimobi emerged as Deputy National Chairman in March 2020 when the NWC wrote a letter to the Southwest to nominate a candidate. This was after the position became vacant with the appointment of Otunba Niyi Adebayo as Minister. APC claims his appointment received the support of five of the Six southwest states of Oyo, Ondo, Osun, Ogun and Lagos and that only Ekiti protested the nomination.

Governors elected on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC), have said they will intervene in some of the party’s current challenges. In a statement released on Sunday after an emergency teleconference meeting, chairman of the Progressive Governors Forum (PGF), Abubakar Bagudu, said the governors will work to uphold internal democracy in the selection of candidates for Edo and Ondo governorship elections. “Collectively agreed to work to ensure strengthening fair and democratic internal party mechanism for the selection of party candidates in all elections, especially in respect of Edo and Ondo States 2020 governorship elections. “Forum members are confident that the party will resolve all current challenges and emerge stronger,” Bagudu’s statement read in part. The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki and the APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, have been at loggerheads, leading to tension in the state chapter of the party. Obaseki has since been disqualified from contesting in the party’s primary on June 22 and is believed to be considering joining another political party.

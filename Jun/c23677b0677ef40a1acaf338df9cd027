Inter Milan striker, Romelu Lukaku, on Sunday night mouthed obscenities at teammate Victor Moses after the Nigerian star failed to pick him out in their 2-1 win over Parma in the Serie A. Inter Milan defeated Parma, thanks to two second-half goals from Stefan de Vrij and Alessandro Bastoni. Ivory Coast forward, Gervinho, did score for the host at the Ennio Tardini Stadium. However, there was the chance to add a third goal in stoppage time when Moses was played through in the 95th minute, but the 29-year-old could not find Lukaku. Lukaku then screamed at Moses, saying, “Victor F***ing Hell!” after the winger’s cross failed to beat the first man. The win over Parma means Inter Milan are now in the third position on the Serie A table with 61 points from 28 games. Antonio Conte’s side will host Brescia in their next fixture on Wednesday.

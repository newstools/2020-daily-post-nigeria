Former Manchester United midfield maestro, Paul Scholes, has revealed that striker, Odion Ighalo has added a ‘target man’ to the Red Devils squad. According to Scholes, Ighalo gives Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, a unique center-forward presence in his squad, which the club has been lacking for some time. Man United and Chinese club, Shanghai Shenhua reached an agreement to extend Ighalo’s second loan contract until January 2021 last week. But Scholes said he has been pleasantly surprised by the impact the 30-year-old Nigerian striker has made at the Old Trafford so far. “You have to say Solskjaer’s three or four signings have been excellent,” Scholes told MUTV. “I was a little bit dubious about the Ighalo one, I was not quite sure how that would work, but you have to say that’s worked as well. “He is a different kind of player from the players we had, a bit more of a target man which we miss and he seems to have settled in really well, scoring goals.” Ighalo scored four goals, registered one assist in eight appearances for Man United so far this campaign. The former Watford star will hope to continue his impressive form for Solskjaer’s men once the Premier League resume on June 17.

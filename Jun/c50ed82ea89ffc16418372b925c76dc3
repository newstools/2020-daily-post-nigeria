Former Oyo Governor, Adebayo Alao-Akala, has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will work towards unity and electoral victories in honour of late ex-Governor, Abiola Ajimobi. Akala in a condolence message said he and his wife were deeply saddened. The politician noted that he was comforted in the fact that Ajimobi left behind “enduring legacies for the people of Oyo State to enjoy for generations.” He described late Ajimobi as a passionate public administrator and a powerful voice of moral conscience. The party leader said they have lost a giant as Ajimobi was a fearless leader, a protector of democracy and a fighter for the people of Yoruba nation. “He was a politician of high repute and immense clout. All his life, he defined his politics and pitted his tent early in life with the progressive school”. Akala said that late Ajimobi’s decision to set up APC Reconciliation Committee in Oyo was informed by his desperation to see a united party. He regretted that Ajimobi did not live to see him reconcile aggrieved members. Akala, however, pledged that the committee would deliver on the desired mandate. “Senator Ajimobi honoured me with an appointment to Chair Oyo State APC Reconciliation Committee. We’ll not only ensure a united APC but also dedicate our future landslide electoral victories to the departed great leader. He prayed Almighty Allah to comfort the family and grant Ajimobi Al-Jannah Fridauz.

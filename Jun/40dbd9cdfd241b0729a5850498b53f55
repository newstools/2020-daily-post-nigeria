Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said that he won’t change his mind over David Luiz’s future at the club. Luiz replaced Pablo Mari in the Gunners’ 3-0 defeat to Manchester City on Wednesday night and was responsible for the first two goals. The Brazilian’s poor touch allowed Raheem Sterling to slam the ball past Bernd Leno. Luiz was then sent off after fouling Riyad Mahrez in the box. Kevin De Bruyne stepped up to score from the spot. Phil Foden added a third goal, to seal all three points for the champions. Arteta, speaking on Luiz, said: “He has spoken in the dressing room. David is someone that’s very honest and straightforward. “My opinion on David hasn’t changed. The moment I joined, what he’s done for the team, what he’s done for me, he won’t change because he had a difficult performance tonight.” Luiz’s current deal expires this month, but Arsenal have an option of extending it by another year.

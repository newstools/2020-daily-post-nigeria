Abike Dabiri-Erewa, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM) has called out the All Progressives Congress (APC) for excluding women in the committee for Edo State Primary Election. APC, over the weekend announced a seven-man committee for the primary election scheduled to hold on Monday June 22. The party also posted a picture of the committee headed by Governor Hope Uzodinma on its official Twitter page, which had only male as members. The tweet alongside picture read; “Members of the Edo State Primary Election Committee led by Hope Uzodimma have arrived Benin City ahead of tomorrow’s exercise.” This got the attention of Abike Dabiri-Erewa who wondered why no woman was listed in the committee. The NIDCOM boss in response wrote: “Na wa oh APC. Not a single woman? Haba!” Meanwhile, the APC, Edo Governorship primaries Committee, headed by Gov.

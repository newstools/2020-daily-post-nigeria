The All Progressives Congress, APC has reacted to the resignation of Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki from the party. The party in a statement on Tuesday, signed by national publicity secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, denied knowledge of Obaseki Resignation. He said the party has not been briefed and would not give any details yet. “The party has no record of the reported defection of Governor Godwin Obaseki from the Progressive party. “We cannot comment at this moment on media reports suggesting the Edo governor or anyone else has left our great party,” the terse statement read. Obaseki made known his resignation from the party on Tuesday after meeting President Buhari on Tuesday. The Governor was disqualified from participating in the June 22 Governorship Primary Election of the party in Edo State, over alleged discrepancies in his HSC and NYSC certificate.

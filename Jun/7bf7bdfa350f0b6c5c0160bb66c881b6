Mesut Ozil’s agent, Erkut Sogut, has insisted that the Arsenal playmaker was not dropped by Adidas. Speaking with ESPN, Sogut said Ozil wants to focus on building his own brand once his boot deal expires at the end of June. Reports in Germany on Wednesday, claimed the 31-year-old had been “dumped” by Adidas, due to concerns over his public image and the financial impact of the coronavirus on the sportswear company. But Sogut maintains that both parties have known for some time the seven-and-a-half-year contract would end this summer. “Adidas knew he was pushing his own thing. He has been doing it on Twitter lately so it is now time to build his own brand while he is still actively playing. “That is unique in football. Some players reach the end of their career and then try to build a brand, but we think that is too late,” he said. Ozil’s lifestyle and sportswear brand is called M10.

The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has said that Nigeria is yet to reach the “peak” of coronavirus infections. The Chairman of PTF, Mr. Boss Mustapha, made this known on Monday at the COVID-19 daily press briefing in Abuja. Mustapha said it was necessary to restate to the citizenry that Nigeria had not reached the peak of COVID-19 confirmed cases, adding that the battle against the virus was a long term battle. He also urged Nigerian to pursue a strategy that would aid the sustainable control of the spread of the virus, stressing that risk communications and community engagement should remain a top priority. According to him, the test count nationwide had exceeded 60,000, stating that a shift in focus to enhanced risk communication and community engagement was imperative. He said: “The PTF considers that while Nigeria’s COVID-19 confirmed cases have increased in the period under review, the following factors should inspire confidence in the response. “Majority of the confirmed cases are in a handful of local government areas in the country as 20 out of the 774 LGAs nationwide account for 60 per cent of the cases.”

Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp on Saturday welcomed Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho to Anfield. Klopp wants the England international to make a transfer move to Liverpool, adding that the RED’s shirt would suit him very well. DAILY POST had reported that Liverpool, alongside Chelsea and Manchester United, are also interested in signing Sancho from Dortmund this summer’s transfer window. “The red shirt would suit him very well. I do not think such a transfer will be possible this season,” Klopp told BILD. “He is a very interesting player. If he’s coming to Liverpool, I would be the most surprised of all of us.” This is coming after Liverpool were confirmed champions of England following Chelsea’s 2-1 win over Manchester City in the Premier League on Thursday night.

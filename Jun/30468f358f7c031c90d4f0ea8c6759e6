Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he expects his players to hit the ground running, when they travel to Tottenham Hotspur in their first game when the Premier League season restarts. United are away to Spurs on June 19 and Solskjaer said his squad will be ready, just like they were for the first game of the season, when they hammered Chelsea 4-0 at Old Trafford. “Everyone knows that we’ll have to be at our best, have to be focused [against Tottenham]. We know it’s a big game for everyone. “We had Chelsea when we started the league this season so I’m confident that our players can go into the Tottenham game with that mentality of going there to play a very good game of football,” Solskjaer told the club’s official website. United are in fifth place and were undefeated in 11 fixtures in all competitions, before COVID-19 forced football to be put on hold.

The FCT Administration has vehemently condemned the Abuja concert that featured Naira Marley. Authorities warned Abuja residents that COVID-19 measures should not be taken for granted. FCTA told them to take personal responsibility for their health and desist from violating the extant guidelines put in place to curtail the spread. The Minister, Musa Bello, issued this warning on Tuesday while reacting to the music show held at the Jabi Lake Mall on June 13. He said videos of the event “showed a concert going on with music and live performances by a band and dancers. The video also showed attendees dancing to the live performances on the elaborately constructed stage”. Bello expressed dismay that many aspects of the guidelines as postulated by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 as well as the FCTA were being disobeyed. He said it was disheartening to see residents not abiding by the basic instructions including “facial covering, social distancing and hand washing or sanitizing. These guidelines have been put in place in order to save and safeguard lives”. Bello noted that adherence could be the difference between life and death and wondered “whether that concert or party which is clearly against the law is worth the health or life of a citizen”. Hinting that enforcement will be stricter, he said there shall be no gathering of more than 20 people outside of a workplace or places of worship. Bello reiterated mandatory use of face masks when in public and observance of social distancing of at least 2 meters between 2 people while in public. He stressed that the ban on all congregational events such as parties, weddings, concerts was still in effect. Bello said all clubs, bars, gardens, beer parlors, recreational parks, communal sports facilities, movie theaters must remain shut. “Markets and business premises are to remain open between 8 am and 3 pm. There is a ban on interstate travel”, the minister added.

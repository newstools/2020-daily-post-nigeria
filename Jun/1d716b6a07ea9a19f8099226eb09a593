Mr Festus Okoye, the National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, in a statement after a virtual meeting on Tuesday in Abuja, announced that party primaries for the Edo Governorship election will hold between June 2 and June 27. “The All Progressives Congress (APC) direct primary will take place on June 22, while the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) would hold indirect primary between June 19 and June 20,” Okoye said. He added that other parties: the African Action Congress (AAC), African Democratic Party (ADP), Allied Peoples Movement (APM), New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP) will conduct their indirect primaries on June 25.

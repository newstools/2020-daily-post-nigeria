A former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has ‘attacked’ President Muhammadu Buhari over the recent happenings in the All Progressives Congress, APC. Fayose said that what is happening in the ruling party pointed to what he described as the helpless situation of Nigeria, adding that Buhari, who is the leader of the APC cannot even run it. The former Governor said that the president cannot even manage the affairs of his immediate family not to talk of his party and the nation. Fayose had earlier described the APC crisis as a show of God’s anger. He said the development was due to the way the current government had treated Nigerians since its emergence. President Buhari has since made no comment even as the crisis rocking the ruling party gets messier to the level that over two persons have laid claim to its National Chairmanship position following the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole by the court. Just yesterday, party Deputy Secretary, Yekini Nabena, cried out, urging President Buhari to act fast by at least calling for the party’s emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting to address the leadership crisis rocking the party. “What is happening to the APC in Edo State is a pointer to the helpless situation that our country is now,” Fayose tweeted on Saturday night. “The President who should be the leader of APC cannot even run the affairs of his immediate family not to talk of managing his party and the nation. “Gold is only sold to those who know the worth. Sadly, Nigeria is currently being managed by strange bird fellows, who took it by conspiracy and deception. “People who can’t even manage their party. Now, our country is bleeding seriously, and we must salvage it together.”

Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its National Chairman of planning to disqualify him from the June 22 primary election. His alarm was contained in a statement Friday afternoon by his media aide, Crusoe Osagie. He condemned the “extreme display of lawlessness and dictatorship by Comrade Adams Oshiomhole”. The statement alleged that the chairman “would announce in a press conference the disqualification of Governor Obaseki”. It said Oshiomhole has “subverted all due process and broken all the laws in the books in his ultimate quest to crown himself as the godfather of politics in Edo State”. Obaseki accused his predecessor of claiming that “he is the Supreme Court and the ultimate determiner of the fate of aspirants for governorship seat under the APC”. He alleged that Oshiomhole has executed “his pre-conceived agenda” of stopping him from flying the flag of the party at all cost. The statement added that after pushing the narrative about Obaseki’s educational qualification and “meeting a brick wall with the University of Ibadan’s response“, Oshiomhole resorted to “his characteristic brute force.”

The Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 on Monday said Daycare centres and primary schools remain closed. This was disclosed by the National Coordinator of the Committee, Sani Aliyu during its daily briefing in Abuja. “All daycares and primary schools to remain closed till further evaluation,” Aliyu said. Recall that the Chairman of the Committee and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Boss Mustapha had earlier announced the “safe” reopening of schools. Mustapha had said only graduating classes would be allowed to resume. He had explained that the measure was to allow the graduating classes prepare for their final examinations. President Muhammadu Buhari had a few months ago ordered the closure of schools due to the Coronavirus pandemic. The decision was a measure to curb the spread of the virus in Nigeria.

Nobel Laureate, Wole Soyinka, has claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari is not in charge of Nigeria. Soyinka stated this during an interview on PlusTv Africa on Thursday. He was reacting to an open letter written to the President by retired colonel and former Military Administrator of Kaduna, Umar Dangiwa. In the letter, Dangiwa accused Buhari of appointing only people from Northern Nigeria into office. Dangiwa cited a few examples to back up his allegations and warned Buhari to stop ignoring Christians and those from Southern Nigeria. Soyinka said: “I have said this before. I don’t believe there is really anybody in charge in Aso Rock. I’ve been studying the trend over the past year and a half and I believe this president is not in charge of this nation, in so many aspects and directions. “It is not the fact alone, we know the history of this. We know what it has caused the nation and we know it isn’t over yet. And you say you are launching an enquiry. That’s not enough.”

Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State has described his deceased Deputy Chief of Staff (DCoS), Mikhail Jare Adebisi, as a courageous person who stood out in terms of loyalty, consistency and dedication to duty. He also described the late Adebisi as one of his most loyal and dedicated staff who, despite his health challenges, took his job seriously. Oyetola made these known on Monday while playing host to the cabinet members, led by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Prince Wole Oyebamiji, who visited him to brief him on what transpired at the 3rd Day Fidau prayer for the late Adebisi, as well as Members of the State House of Assembly, led by the Speaker, Timothy Owoeye, who had visited to condole with the governor. The governor, who said it would be difficult to find a replacement for his late aide, further noted that: “In spite of the health challenges, he never joked with his job. When he was leaving for Lagos, he said, ‘pray for me sir’ and I became frightened. “He was one of the most loyal and dedicated staff around me. He was a man of courage, a good example of what loyalty and dedication are all about. You can rely on him any time, any day. “Jare took initiatives and did assignment even before telling him. “He equally stood out in terms of consistency and dedication. He did not like to be pitied even despite his health challenge. But for the pandemic, he would have been flown out again for treatment. “It will be difficult to find a replacement for him. “Even on sickbed, he was coordinating his work. We all will miss him.” He prayed God to grant his team good health and long life to contribute their quota to the development of the State and Nigeria. “I pray we all end well. Put premium on your health. Take your health seriously. Do regular and routine checkups,” Oyetola admonished.

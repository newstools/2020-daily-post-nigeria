The Nigerian government has announced plans to engage community volunteers for COVID-19. They will embark on house-to-house sensitisation on the dangers and spread of coronavirus. Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, disclosed this on Tuesday at the Presidential Taskforce (PTF) briefing on COVID-19. He disclosed that the ministry was working with the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, (NPHCDA) on the modalities. Ehanire explained that the targets were “high burden” Local Government Areas, as 20 LGAs contribute nearly 60 percent of the COVID-19 positive cases. The team will also visit the contiguous Ogun State on the same mission. “The visits are in continuation of similar useful initiatives in the past to Kano, Katsina Sokoto, Jigawa, Gombe, and Borno, to share experience and ideas, align strategy and support each other,” Ehanire said.

The Nigerian League of Women Voters, Niger State chapter has called for the death penalty for offenders of rape and sexual-related offenses in the country. The women who are aggrieved over the spate of rape in the country say the lack of stiff laws to punish offenders is responsible for the continued violation of women, girls and to a certain extend boys. The State Chairperson of the League and Coordinator, North Central, Aisha Lemu stated this during a match to deliver a Letter of Protest Against Rape and other sexual offenses to the state Governor Abubakar Sani Bello. The women urged the state government to rise against rape in the state. Received by the Secretary, Niger State Government, SSG, Ahmed Matane, Lemu, tasked the Governor to come to the aid of women in the state to put an end to the menace. She said, “If, they say women’s dressing is what entices men to rape them, the question now is what will entice a man to rape a three months ago baby, 85 years old woman or even a father raping his own daughters for ten years?. Please, offenders should be killed, they don’t deserve to live. Enough is enough.” The North Central Coordinator also said the league is embarking on sensitization of mothers on the need to teach their daughters or wards how to report when raped while also calling on the public to stop stigmatizing victims. Responding, the SSG noted that rape has become a national problem which requires a legislative Act that is punitive to reduce the trend. Frowning at the act, he told the members of the association of the readiness of the Niger State government to collaborate with them to address the issue. He said, ” Beyond this protest, we need to come up with ways to address the issue and it is a national issue. If we do not rise up, what guarantee do you have that tomorrow, it will not be either your mother or daughter that will be raped. Rape is unacceptable, it is inhuman. We need to protest our women”.

Amidst protest in America, Popular rapper, Kanye West has donated $2 million to support the grieving families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbrery, and Breonna Taylor. The 42-year-old rapper, who has been mute on social media amid the ongoing protests over George Floyd’s death, also set up a college fund to cover the tuition for Floyd’s six-year-old daughter, Gianna Floyd. A representative of the rapper confirmed his contribution to CNN. He added that Kanye has also offered to cover the legal fees for the families of Arbery and Taylor. The killing of Floyd by a police officer led to Black Lives Matter movement and protests demanding an end to police brutality and justice for George Floyd and the deaths of other African-Americans. On Thursday, the Minnesota Attorney General, Keith Ellison yielded to calls and increased the charges against a former Minneapolis police officer who was involved in the killing of an African-American man, George Floyd in the US to second-degree murder. The white police officer, Derek Chauvin, who was seen in the viral video with his knee on Floyd’s neck, was earlier charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter which protesters complained were not harsh enough for the crime. The three other ex-officers involved in the killing, Tou Thao, Thomas Lane, and J. Alexander Kueng were also charged with aiding and abetting second degree murder.

Two people were feared dead and many others injured in a fatal road accident along Damaturu-Potiskum highway in Yobe State. The accident was said to have occurred in the early hours of Wednesday where a bus and a golf saloon both conveying passengers from opposite destinations involved in a head-on collision amidst alleged high speed. Personnel of the Federal Road Safety Corps upon receiving a distress call immediately mobilized to the scene and conveyed the victims to the Yobe State Specialists Hospital in Damaturu and General Hospital Damagum where they are receiving treatment. Though, eyewitnesses declined comments on what led to the fatal road crash. However, DAILY POST Correspondent gathered that one of the drivers of the vehicle was suspected to fall asleep and lost control of his vehicle; thereby engaged his counterpart in a head to head collision.

UEFA is planning to play all Champions League knockout games in Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. Sky Italia reports that the final will be played August 23, following 12 days of matches. However, UEFA’s executive committee must agree on the plan on Wednesday, among a series of decisions to reschedule international soccer, after COVID-19 disrupted the global sports calendar. The final is likely to take place on a rare Sunday at Benfica’s Stadium of Light. It was originally to be played on Saturday, May 30 at Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. Semifinals will be split between the Stadium of Light and the home stadium of Sporting Lisbon close by on August 18-19. Four quarterfinals are planned on consecutive nights from August 12-15. Four places in the last eight are yet to be decided and UEFA’s executive panel will reach a decision on scheduling second-leg games that were postponed in March. Those games could also go to Lisbon or be played without fans in the home stadiums of Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Juventus and Manchester City.

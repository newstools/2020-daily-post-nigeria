Nobel laureate, Wole Soyinka, has called for those responsible for alleged lopsided appointments in President Muhammadu Buhari’s government to be punished. Soyinka made the demand during an interview on PlusTv Africa on Thursday. The renowned writer, reacting to an open letter written by retired colonel Umar Dangiwa, over skewed appointments in Buhari’s regime, said: “Umar hit the nail hard and got to the point factually without self-interest. I was appalled when I saw the letter and I said to myself why should I be surprised that such atrocities have been going on. “This kind of revelation (by Col. Umar) is earth-shaking and really nation disintegrating. It requires two things: One is outright denial with proof that it is false. Two, literally, a restructuring of that sector completely. Something like (to) send everybody there on temporary leave and revamp. “People come to me with all kinds of documented evidence of this greed and insult to the nation. “I was appalled by the silence that followed this revelation. Many of us feel inhibited. We don’t want to make statements that might seem inflammatory. And yet this kind of reticence encourages a sense of impunity. “I think those responsible for this criminal lop-sidedness should be punished. It is not sufficient to discuss it and to say you are restructuring. It is criminal at this level. It requires an upheaval in that sector.”

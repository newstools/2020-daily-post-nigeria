Manchester United legend, Gary Neville, has blamed David de Gea for the goal Tottenham Hotspur scored, during a 1-1 game in the Premier League on Friday. Providing commentary on Sky Sports, Neville said De Gea will be “extremely disappointed” with himself, for failing to keep out Steven Bergwijn’s shot. The Spanish goalkeeper fumbled Bergwijn’s effort into his net, to give Spurs the lead. However, Bruno Fernandes made it 1-1, after Eric Dier fouled Paul Pogba inside the penalty area. “I think David de Gea will be extremely disappointed. He’s got to save that. “Bergwjin does really well. He’s got past Harry Maguire. But that shot is really close to De Gea. That’s really poor from the goalkeeper. Really poor. “It’s fine margins. Hugo Lloris made a key save from Rashford at one end. De Gea has let one slip at the other,” Neville said.

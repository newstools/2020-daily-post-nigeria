German Lead Scientist Peter Kremsner has said the first results of a coronavirus vaccine clinical trial will be available within two months. The process started at the University of Tuebingen on Thursday. It includes more than 100 voluntary test subjects aged between 18 and 60. The trial will ascertain the human body’s tolerance and immune response to the vaccine. “It will be done quite swiftly,’’ Dpa quoted Kremsner as saying on Friday. The first test subject, a young woman, was administered the first dose of the vaccine on Friday She will be monitored for 24 hours to make sure that she doesn’t have an adverse reaction. “If everything goes well with the first test subject, the next three will start on Monday, four to eight others will start on Wednesday, and it will increase from there,’’ Kremsner said.

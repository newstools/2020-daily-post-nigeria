It was a disastrous scenario at the early hour of Monday as fire gutted the popular Benin Monarch market close to the palace of the Oba of Benin Kingdom. Eyewitness who pleaded not to be mentioned told DAILY POST that all effort to reach the State Fire Service proved abortive as the state owned fire agency complained of not having water and fuel at their disposal. He said: ”Oga, you can see everything by yourself. When the fire started, we called the fire service. All they could say was that there was no water and fuel to come and help.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808076" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A294E11C-A29F-472D-8049-93A4AEA98CE1-scaled.jpeg" alt="" width="2560" height="1152" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A294E11C-A29F-472D-8049-93A4AEA98CE1-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A294E11C-A29F-472D-8049-93A4AEA98CE1-300x135.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A294E11C-A29F-472D-8049-93A4AEA98CE1-1024x461.jpeg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A294E11C-A29F-472D-8049-93A4AEA98CE1-1536x691.jpeg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/A294E11C-A29F-472D-8049-93A4AEA98CE1-2048x922.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"> ”Oga, see Oba market, see fire service office here; just behind this building, and they said they don’t have water and fuel. You can imagine” Also, the state woman leader, Madam Blackky Ogiamien said she was surprised when she received a distress call concerning the incident. ”I received a call from one of my members saying Oba market was on fire around 1 am to 2 am. I quickly rushed down from my house at Dumez road and thank God for the fire men from the Government House, else the whole market would have been burnt down.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-808075" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/50AFEFB4-6B0C-4E0A-92E1-E9BE64CB6E45-scaled.jpeg" alt="" width="2560" height="1152" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/50AFEFB4-6B0C-4E0A-92E1-E9BE64CB6E45-scaled.jpeg 2560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/50AFEFB4-6B0C-4E0A-92E1-E9BE64CB6E45-300x135.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/50AFEFB4-6B0C-4E0A-92E1-E9BE64CB6E45-1024x461.jpeg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/50AFEFB4-6B0C-4E0A-92E1-E9BE64CB6E45-1536x691.jpeg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/50AFEFB4-6B0C-4E0A-92E1-E9BE64CB6E45-2048x922.jpeg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"> ”Since the closure of markets in Benin, we have not had any fire incident, the government just reopen this market and see what is happening. We are still thinking of what can be done concerning that of Ekiosa that happened last year and this one has happened, making the whole thing more worrisome,” she added.

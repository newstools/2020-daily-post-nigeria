Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has declared support for financial autonomy for States’ Legislature and Judiciary. Ayuba Wabba, NLC President, stated the position of labour in a statement on Monday. He commended President Muhammadu Buhari for signing the Executive Order 10. Last week, the federal government released details of the order. The order makes it mandatory for state governments to include the allocation of the judiciary and legislative arms as first-line charges in their annual budgets. Wabba expressed confidence that the step would deepen the democratic process and good governance in Nigeria. He insisted the distortion of due process, checks and balances, and public accountability, were the core ingredients in the principle of separation of powers. He emphasised that point that strong legislative and judiciary institutions of government are the strong pillars of democracy and good governance. Wabba stressed that a resilient judiciary and a conscientious legislature were sine qua non to the deepening of the democratic process, promotion of public accountability and ensuring popular participation. The union leader opined that there would have been not for the establishment of the Presidential Implementation Committee (on March 22, 2019) if governors were going the right thing. Wabba observed that until the release of Executive Order 10, there were very little signs to show governors’ seriousness to comply with the clear demands of Section 121 (3) of the constitution. He urged political leaders to respect the wishes of the people and allow the full implementation of financial autonomy for the judiciary and legislature in states.

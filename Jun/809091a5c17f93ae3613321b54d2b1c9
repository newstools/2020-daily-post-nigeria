The All Progressives Congress, APC National Vice Chairman, South South, Prince Hilliard Eta, has declared that the former Deputy National Secretary, Victor Giadom is no longer a member of the ruling party. Eta, who was appointed by the National Working Committee, NWC, of the party, to act on behalf of Deputy National Chairman, South, Sen. Abiola Ajimobi, was reacting to the National Executive Council meeting called by Giadom. Eta said Giadom’s NEC meeting is unconstitutional. He spoke while addressing journalists after receiving the report of Edo State APC Governorship Primary Election Committee. “I sit here on behalf of Distinguished Senator Abiola Ajimobi as the acting Chairman of this party,” he said. He called on journalists to take the burden of investigating Giadom’s locus to see if he has the legal or constitutional backing to call for such a meeting. “As we speak, the membership of Chief Giadom has been suspended by a competent court of jurisdiction in Port Harcourt this afternoon. “Not only is he not a member of the NWC, from today [Tuesday], his membership of the APC has been suspended,” he said. Eta said he wondered why anyone can even address Victor Giadom as a factional acting Chairman. Speaking further, Eta quoted article 25B (i and ii) of the party’s Constitution (2014 as amended, saying, “The National Executive Committee shall meet every quarter and or at any time decided by the National Chairman or at the request made in writing by at least two-thirds of the members of the National Executive Committee provided that not less than fourteen days’ notice is given for the meeting to be summoned. “Without prejudice to Article 25(B)(i) of this Constitution, the National Working Committee may summon an emergency National Executive Committee meeting at any time, provided that at least seven days’ notice of the meeting shall be given to all those entitled to attend.”

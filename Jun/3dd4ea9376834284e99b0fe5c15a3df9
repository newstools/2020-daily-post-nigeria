Super Eagles winger, Moses Simon, has said he is very keen to join La Liga giant, Real Madrid in the future. Moses said his ambition is to play for Los Blancos one day in his career, adding that he drew inspiration from compatriot, Odion Ighalo, who joined his boyhood club, Manchester United on loan from Shanghai Shenhua. The 24-year-old said this while speaking on his future in an interview with Brila.net. “I can’t say anything about my club at the moment,” Moses said. “I am a player of Levante and at the moment on loan to Nantes. “Growing up, I loved the white and white colours of Real Madrid, and I hope to play for the club one day. “Ighalo’s ambition was to play for Manchester United, and he achieved that, I have the same target and hopefully I will play for Madrid.” Moses is currently on loan at French Ligue 1 side, Nantes from La Liga club, Levante.

Odion Ighalo has spoken about his delight at extending his Manchester United loan deal. The 30-year-old joined United in January on an initial six-month contract from Shanghai Shenhua. Ighalo went on to score four goals in eight appearances, before it expired on May 31. However, both clubs have agreed on an extension, which will see the Nigerian striker remain at Old Trafford until January 2021. “I’m really happy. It’s a dream for me to be here. I’m buzzing and ready to go,” Ighalo told MUTV. “The last few days have been difficult as there have been different talks about it but now I’m really happy, so I need to concentrate fully. I’m here until the end of January, so it’s good for me.” The last time Ighalo featured for the Red Devils, was in a Europa League fixture at LASK where he netted twice. The match took place behind closed doors as COVID-19 began to spread throughout Europe. “It’s a bit strange without fans, and difficult, but we have to be safe so we have to do it,” Ighalo added.

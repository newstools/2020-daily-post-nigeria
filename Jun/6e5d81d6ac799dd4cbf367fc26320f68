Liverpool could be banned from playing their remaining home fixtures at Anfield, if fans continue partying on the streets, according to the Daily Mail. The Reds’ supporters were pictured drinking, smoking and taking drugs, after their club was confirmed Premier League champions for the 2019/2020 campaign. Liverpool, Merseyside Police, the City Council and Mayor Joe Anderson all condemned some of their own supporters, for “wholly unacceptable” behaviour, which “risked public safety”. Thousands swarmed into the city centre, despite repeated warnings over the spread of COVID-19. The iconic Liver Building was also set on fire by a firework on Friday, as fans ignored social-distancing rules. A joint statement from Liverpool, the police and the council said: “Our city is still in a public health crisis and this behaviour is wholly unacceptable. “The potential danger of a second peak of Covid-19 still exists and we need to work together to make sure we don’t undo everything that has been achieved.”

The White House has denied that President Donald Trump was briefed on United States security ‘intelligence on Russia’. The New York Times had reported that Russia’s military offered bounties to Taliban-linked militants to kill the U.S troops in Afghanistan. On Saturday, Press Secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, absolved the Trump presidency. “Neither the president nor the vice president (Mike Pence) were briefed on the alleged Russian bounty intelligence,” McEnany said in a statement. Joe Biden, Democratic presidential candidate, reacted angrily to the intel. Reuters quoted him as saying the report, if true, represents a, “truly shocking revelation” Biden noted that Trump has, “failed to sanction or impose any kind of consequences on Russia for this egregious violation of international law”. He said the U.S. leader, “has continued his embarrassing campaign of deference and debasing himself before (President) Vladimir Putin”. The candidate vowed retaliation if he becomes president. “If I’m elected president, make no mistake about it, Vladimir Putin will be confronted, and we’ll impose serious costs on Russia,” Biden said.

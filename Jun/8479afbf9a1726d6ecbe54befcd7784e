The COVID-19 test results of the Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu and his family have been revealed. Ikpeazu, his wife, Mrs. Nkechi, and their children all tested negative for the virus. Their COVID-19 results were made public after the Abia State First family took the test last week Saturday. Ikpeazu revealed the test results in a statement he personally signed and forwarded to DAILY POST, on Tuesday. He, however, disclosed that two of his aides tested positive. The statement reads: “Leading this battle from the front as your Governor, I and all members of the first family subjected ourselves to COVID-19 tests on Saturday, May 30, 2020 and the results came out negative today. “Unfortunately, results of two of my aides who also subjected themselves to COVID-19 tests were positive while others turned in negative results. We are confident that within days, the currently asymptomatic positive patients who are now isolated will be successfully nursed back to good health, with God on our side.” The governor also directed all Chairmen and deputies of local government areas in the state to reveal their COVID-19 test results.

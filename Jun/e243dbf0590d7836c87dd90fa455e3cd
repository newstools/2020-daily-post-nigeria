Arsenal’s sporting director, Edu, has given reasons why the club has not gotten rid of David Luiz. There have been calls for the Gunners not to keep Luiz, following a disastrous cameo in the 3-0 defeat at Manchester City last Wednesday. The Brazilian came off the bench to replace the injured Pablo Mari and gave away the first two goals. Luiz also conceded a penalty before he was sent off. After the game, fans and pundits suggested it would be the last time he would appear in the red and white. However, Arsenal has decided to extend his deal by another year. On why the club extended Luiz’s contract, Edu told the official website: “I am really happy that we will have these players in our squad for the future. “They have been part of the long-term technical plan Mikel and I have developed. They bring the right balance to our squad. “David [Luiz] is a really important player for us. “He has played most of our matches this season and has been important for the team. His passing, his communication with the team on and off the pitch. He helps everyone.”

Wrestling legend, Mark Calaway, popularly known as The Undertaker has hinted on the possibility of retiring from WWE. Undertaker, whose career has spanned over three decades, said he has no desire to get back in the ring. The 55-year-old made the disclosure during the new WWE biopic The Last Ride. His most recent match was against wrestler AJ Styles in April, where he buried his opponent and rode away on a motorcycle. “It was a perfect moment. You do not necessarily always get those,” BBC quoted Undertaker as saying. “If there was ever a perfect ending to a career, that right there was it.” He added: “It’s time this cowboy rides away. “I can do more good outside the ring than I can inside. “I am finally at a place where I can accept that.” Undertaker is yet to officially announce his retirement from WWE. The American began his career with World Class Championship Wrestling in 1984 and later moved to the WWE in the 1990s. Undertaker has won multiple world heavyweight champion, six-time tag team titleholder and winner of the Royal Rumble.

One of the four suspected gangsters who were given ‘jungle justice’ treatment in the Adamawa State capital, Yola, has died of high degree burns. The four young men who allegedly belong to a gang called Shila Boys were held and set ablaze in the Jimeta metropolis of Yola on Wednesday evening by a mob who accused them of stealingvaluable items from people. DAILY POST gathered on Thursday morning that the four were rescued by police operatives and were moved to a hospital where one of them died in the early hours of Thursday. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Suleiman Nguroje, confirmed that while one of the four gave up the ghost about 1 am Thursday, the other three were responding to treatment. “Of the three still being treated, the police were able to locate the families of two who are from Wurro Jabbe (in Yola South LGA). The one who died was a resident of Nasarawo (Yola North LGA),” the PPRO said. He added that immediately the three survivors recover, the police would investigate them to trace other members of their group and bring them to justice. The jungle justice on the four suspected Shila Boys marks a continuation of what has become a growing trend in Yola against the young gangsters. On May 10, three Shila Boys were lynched by an angry crowd in Demsawo.

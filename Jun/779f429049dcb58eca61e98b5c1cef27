The Senator representing Anambra Central Senatorial district, Mrs. Uche Ekwunife, has declared her intention to run for the governorship position of Anambra State in 2021. Anambra will in November 2021 be going to polls to elect a successor for Governor Willie Obiano who is doing his second term in office, after winning re-election in 2017. Kingsley Ubani, Special Assistant on Media to Senator Uche Ekwunife, announced this in a press release on Thursday night, saying that the Senator has declared her intention in a small gathering on people from Nri and Igboukwu in Anaocha and Aguata Local Government Areas of the state. Ubani said, “Ahead of the 2021 Anambra State Governorship election, Senator Uche Ekwunife (Iyom) today, 18th June, 2020 officially declared her intention to run for the office of the Governor of Anambra State. “She made this known while meeting with the ward executives of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) at Nri and Igboukwu in Anaocha and Aguata Local Government Areas of Anambra State respectively.” He added that the support of the people were overwhelming, just as the senator was further strengthened by the love of the people. Ekwunife has made several attempts to govern Anambra State. She has variously contested under the Progressive People’s Alliance (PPA), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), both as a candidate and as an aspirant gunning for parties’ tickets. She is currently in the PDP, the platform under which she won a senatorial seat in 2019, after hastily dumping All Progressives Congress (APC) where she had also won a ticket for the senatorial contest.

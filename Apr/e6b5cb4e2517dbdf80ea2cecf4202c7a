A former lawmaker representing Kogi West senatorial district at the National Assembly, Senator Dino Melaye has told President Muhammadu Buhari to publicly reject the launch of the 5th Generation (5G) network. Melaye claimed that the 5G is a global economic strategy introduced into the global market purely for economic gain without due regards to human lives. Dino Melaye tweeted, “The real problem is not the coronavirus but the 5G that has been deployed which have some chemical reactions to human cells which eventually manifest as the flu. If this is the problem why is the world not speaking against it? He queried. Why are they still deploying 5G technology all over the globe? “It is already in Maitama, Abuja and in Ikeja, Lagos. These are the two places where they have deployed the technology apparatus in Nigeria, I use this opportunity to call on the federal government and indeed the president of Nigeria, Muhammadu Buhari, to immediately call the attention of the minister of science and technology, that we must demobilize any 5G network already existing in Nigeria. “We have seen videos of animals, plants dying as a result of the harmful biological effect on humans and living organisms. “5G is evil, it is a killer technology, it is helping to mobilize flu that comes in form of coronavirus and it is helping to kill the immune system, those with weaker immune systems, those with underlying medical conditions, they are easily consumed by the reaction of this 5G and they die. We can stop this killing if we can stop the demobilization of this 5G technology.” Melaye called on the Buhari government to make hay while the sun shines, set up a presidential panel to ensure that any major deployment in Nigeria is stopped. The Kogi-born politician advised that all cables and mast must be completely brought down, adding that “we must ensure lives are preserved by taking early precautionary measures.”

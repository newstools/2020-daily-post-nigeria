The former presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party, YPP, Kingsley Moghalu has reacted to the calls for a relaxation of nationwide lockdown despite an increase in cases of Coronavirus. Buhari had on the 13th of April extended the lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states by another two weeks in a bid to tackle the spread of COVID-19.  As the date of expiration approaches, President Muhammadu Buhari has been faced with calls to relax the lockdown in order to prevent insecurity and riot in some states. The Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC warned that there would be social unrest and fall in the economy if the lockdown is extended. Likewise, Primate Elijah Ayodele of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church also told President Muhammadu Buhari to end the lockdown and impose the use of masks Ayodele warned that the lockdown will not help the country. However, Moghalu reacting to the calls, said the reopening of states despite increasing cases of Coronavirus is a big risk for Nigeria. On his Twitter page, he acknowledged that the conflict between staying at home and “Re-opening” is a difficult but ultimately false choice. His Tweet on Thursday read: “COVID-19: The conflict between staying at home and “Re-opening” is a difficult but ultimately false choice. Re-opening now is a big risk. “As I said to my son, if we were in a conventional war and bombs were dropping, would you pretend all is normal? Or is it because this is a virus? Presently, the total of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Abuja is 119 while Lagos stands at 504.

Barcelona has reacted to the death of Dolors Sala Carrió, mother of Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Guardiola’s mother died in Manresa on Monday after contracting Coronavirus (COVID-19). Reacting to the development, Barcelona, in a tweet on its official Twitter page on Monday, offered its condolences to Guardiola, who once coached the club between 2008-2012. Barcelona tweeted: “The loss of Dolors Sala deeply saddens us at FC Barcelona during this difficult time, and we would like to express our most heartfelt condolences, especially to Pep Guardiola, his family, and his friends. Rest in Peace.” Guardiola has since donated the sum of €1million to help in the fight against COVID-19 in Spain.

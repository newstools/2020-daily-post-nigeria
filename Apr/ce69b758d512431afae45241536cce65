Two patients, Abbas Kaka Hassan, a 24-year-old male and Hauwa Mohammed, a 42-year-old female, are on the run after testing positive for COVID-19 at the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital (UMTH). The male is of Layin Tanki in Gwange II area, while the woman lives in Shuwari ward of Maiduguri, the state capital. Commissioner of Health, Dr. Salisu Kwayabura, announced this at a daily media briefing held on Sunday at the state government house. He said Abbas after collecting his result eloped and switched off his phone, as well as a phone number through which the patient’s mother kept in touch with the team. “When samples of patients with contacts to index cases are collected, they are normally advised to go on self-isolation. They give their contacts so they can be reached when the results are out. This is the standard medical procedure. “You can’t detain someone with suspected contact. We do not have the lawful powers to do that. Other patients were also allowed to leave but they came into Isolation Centres and we have 19 of them in two isolation centres. However, the young man in question chose to go into hiding”. Kwayabura, the Secretary of the COVID-19 Response Team assured that officials were working very hard to track the patient, adding that the disease is not a death sentence. Meanwhile, 16 of Borno’s cases emanated from community transmission, while 14 others were connected with the index and another case. Kwayabura also announced that anyone entering major markets at the relaxation of lockdown on Monday must wear a face mask made of cloth material if one does not have the medical mask. He added that the team will make masks available, while hand washing points will also be increased to ensure hands are washed at entry and exit points.

Some designated markets in Rivers State on Tuesday morning, opened for residents to buy and sell ahead of the Easter weekend, NAN reports. The state government had earlier ordered the closure of markets across the state, in a bid to curtail the spread of COVID-19. However, Governor Nyesom Wike last week directed that some markets be reopened for business on Tuesday and Wednesday, between 7am and 12noon. DAILY POST reports that there was a huge turnout as residents shopped ahead of the Easter celebration. However, the governorâ€™s directive did not include the reopening of some major bigger markets like the Oil-Mill and Slaughter/Trans-Amadi markets in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area (LGA) and Mbiama market in Ahoada West LGA.

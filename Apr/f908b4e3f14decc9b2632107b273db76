Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has hinted that the current lockdown in the state could be extended beyond the initial 14 days. Sanwo-Olu stated this while briefing journalists on Saturday. The governor said the extension would depend on how the situation is handled in Lagos. “If there’s a need to extend the lockdown, I will. We got one discharged patient today (recovered from the coronavirus). “We are going to sit down with the committee that is working on the community markets and see if we can announce more next week,” Sanwo-Olu said. Of the 209 cases of COVID-19 currently recorded in Nigeria, Lagos has the highest number at 109 patients.

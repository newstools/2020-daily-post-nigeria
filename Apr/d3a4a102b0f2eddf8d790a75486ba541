The National Examinations Council (NECO) says it has not postponed the 2020 Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) and Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) due to COVID-19. Azeez Sani, Head, Information and Public Relations, said this in a statement in Abuja on Wednesday. Sani disclosed that NECO had noticed the news trending on social media purporting the shift in the 2020 BECE and SSCE. “NECO wishes to state categorically that apart from the 2020 National Common Entrance (NCEE) that was postponed indefinitely due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Council has not reviewed any of its remaining examination, neither is the council contemplating such for now. “The general public is urged to disregard such fake news, as the Council is monitoring the prevailing situation in the country and will make an official pronouncement on the examinations if the need arises”, Sani said. In March, NECO announced the postponement of the 2020 National Common Entrance Examination (NCEE) into Federal Unity Colleges. The examination was earlier scheduled to be held on Saturday 28 March.

A former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili, has reacted to a statement by the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, where he admitted not being aware if doctors and other health practitioners tackling COVID-19 are paid hazard allowances. Ehanire who met with the National Assembly leadership in Abuja on Thursday claimed that what the doctors are doing is routine. Recall that Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila had asked the Minister on Thursday if health workers handling Coronavirus cases were paid any hazard allowance. But, Ehanire responding said: “I am not aware of it, it is the standard job they do every day.” Reacting, Ezekwesili expressed disappointment over the statement by the health minister. She called on Ehanire to take back his statement, adding that this is the time to collaborate with doctors and health care workers to fight COVID-19. Ezekwesili advised the minister to make amends immediately. In a post on her Twitter page, Ezekwesili wrote: “What was that I heard the Minister of Health saying before the House Committee? “He needs to take back some of those statements and build confidence in our Doctors and other HealthCare workers in that sector. “This time more than ever requires collaboration. “Dear Mr Minister Ehanire, I do have an advice deep from my heart. Please think about it and make amends. Blessings!

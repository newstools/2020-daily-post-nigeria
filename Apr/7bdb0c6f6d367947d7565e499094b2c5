Real Madrid has reportedly decided to push back their planned move to sign forward, Kylian Mbappe, from Paris Saint-Germain until 2021 due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The Los Blancos were expected to go all out for Mbappe, who has been a long time target this summer transfer window as the France international prepares to enter the final two years of his PSG’s contract. According to AS, Real Madrid chiefs have reluctantly accepted that their hopes of landing the 21-year-old this summer are dwindling because of financial constraints. The Spanish newspaper reports that Madrid already has plans in place to lure Mbappe to Santiago Bernabeu next year, with his valuation expected to drop from £189million to around £132million in those 12 months. Meanwhile, all major football activities, including the La Liga, Premier League, Bundesliga, Ligue 1 and Serie A have been put on hold. Mbappe has been impressive for PSG since joining the French Ligue 1 champions from Monaco in 2017. He also led the French national team to win the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia.

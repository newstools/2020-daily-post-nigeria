Former Arsenal striker Emmanuel Adebayor has said that he will not be swayed into action by those who have called him out for not donating money to his home country, Togo. The former Tottenham star said this amid the global coronavirus crisis, adding that he will not be parting with his money purely because others wish him to do so. Many footballers have spent their time helping to raise funds or awareness for charities that directly benefit those on the front line of the fight. Such charitable moves prompted some to ask the former Premier League star what he would be doing with the wealth he has accumulated across his long career. But Adebayor, who also played for Manchester City says that he is his own man and won’t be moved by the actions or opinions of others. “I always do things according to the wishes of my heart and not according to the words of others,” Adebayor said in a Facebook live video. “I’m sorry that people compare me to Samuel Eto’o and Didier Drogba by asking me why I don’t have a foundation or why I don’t donate, as if I was the one who brought the coronavirus to Togo. “I am neither the one nor the other, I am me, Sheyi Emmanuel Adebayor. A word of advice for the guys regarding donations, I will not do that. Everything is clear and very simple. Thank you and good day.” The 36-year-old had signed for Olimpia, in the Paraguayan top-flight shortly before COVID-19 forced football to halt.

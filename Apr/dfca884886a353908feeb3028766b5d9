The immediate past Secretary to the Government of Imo state, Uche Onyeagocha has urged the Uzodinma-led administration not to delay in constituting a probe panel over alleged N19.63bn collected by the former Governor, Emeka Ihedioha. Onyeagocha gave this charge while speaking on a radio station (Hot FM) in Owerri. While condemning the idea of the new government resorting to social media in an issue that should be taken seriously, the former SGI said Emeka Ihedioha team was ready to face the probe panel According to him, “the appropriate way of doing this is not to run to the media to make false accusations. There has to be a systematic approach. Senator Hope Uzodinma should publish the report on the audit and streamline it on a month to month basis. Make a separation of Ihedioha’s regime from that of Owelle Rochas Okorocha with reference to dates and ascertain whose administration it was before casting aspersions. That’s the way every reasonable government should handle issues of public importance.” The former federal lawmaker, however, described the allegation as baseless and unfounded. It will be recalled that the State Commissioner for Information, Declan Emelumba, in an interview recently, disclosed that the immediate past government of Emeka Ihedioha allegedly collected the sum of N19.63B from the Local Government Joint Accounts Allocation Committee JAAC which was not accounted for. This, he said, was discovered during a routine audit of Accounts and Records of JAAC with the Bureau for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs by the LGA Auditor-General.

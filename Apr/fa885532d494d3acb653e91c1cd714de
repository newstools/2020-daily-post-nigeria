The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has debunked reports of a mass outbreak of Coronavirus at its facility in Abuja. NNPC in a statement on Saturday shared on its official Twitter page said the reported case of COVID-19 in the nation’s oil company is that of a non-member of staff who had just returned from the United Kingdom and developed symptoms of the virus. The corporation added that the case is an isolated incident and has not endangered its staff. The statement read: “The circumstances of the reported COVID-19 infected individual is at an apartment in the NNPC Estate in the Garki area of Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). “NNPC dismisses insinuations of a mass outbreak of Coronavirus infection in its facility. The National Oil Company is aware of all the actions taken by the @NCDCgov to tackle the singular case, which for now, has remained an isolated incident.”

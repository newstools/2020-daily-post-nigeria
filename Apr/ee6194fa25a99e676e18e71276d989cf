The Police Command in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), has ordered a probe into an alleged assault on members of the Association of Lawyers With Disabilities (ALDIN). Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Anjuguri Manzah, confirmed the investigation to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday. ALDIN had in a statement co-signed by its President, Daniel Onwe and General Secretary, Gaius Ogan, raised an alarm. They alleged that policemen brutalized their members distributing palliatives in Abuja. The statement said the incident happened on April 19 at a Two-One junction, beside Infinix Supermarket, in the Kubwa area of Abuja. “Mr. Onwe and Lawal were on essential duty, delivering food palliatives to other persons with disabilities, who were stranded owing to the COVID-19 lockdown and who had made distress calls. “The policemen without any form of questioning, swooped on Lawal, clubbing him to the ground and later left him in a bloodied state and zoomed off. “The brutal act exhibited by the policemen was the worst form of lawlessness, ironically perpetuated by law enforcement agents.” The association vowed to go to any length to ensure that justice is served to those involved. ALDIN appealed to the Inspector-General of Police and the FCT Police Commissioner to ensure that the culprits are fished out and made to face the full weight of the law. The lawyers added that the Nigerian Bar Association(NBA) has been notified of the assault.

The Kaduna State Standing Committee on COVID-19 has confirmed that the restriction of movement currently in force in the state will be relaxed on Tuesday, April 21 and Wednesday, April 22, 2020. In a statement signed by the Commissioner, Internal Security and Home Affairs, Samuel Aruwan, and made available to newsmen on Monday, said the relaxation of the restriction of movement will subsist from 8am to 6pm on Tuesday and Wednesday. DAILY POST recalled that Kaduna State Government had imposed a 24-hour curfew on the state for the past two weeks. All businesses, except, medical stores and food sellers were shut down as residents were warned not to move about for fear of contracting the deadly COVID-19. However, the temporary lifting of curfew for Tuesday and Wednesday, was to enable residents to restock food and medicines. “Only sellers of food and medicines are permitted to open for trading. Traders in these commodities and their customers must observe social distancing. ” In addition, all residents are expected to begin wearing face masks in public to reinforce the mandatory social distancing. “The general public is reminded that motorcycle taxis and commercial tricycles popularly known as Keke NAPEPs are prohibited from Kaduna roads. Such vehicles are liable to be confiscated and forfeited to the Kaduna State Government, in addition to the fines that will be imposed on their drivers,” Aruwan said “the Kaduna State Government appeals to all residents to exercise personal responsibility and to help protect our state from Covid-19. “This can be done by regularly washing hands with soap and water, observing social distance, practising respiratory hygiene and avoiding large gatherings. ” Residents are advised to stay at home, except when there are compelling reasons for going out,” the statement further said.

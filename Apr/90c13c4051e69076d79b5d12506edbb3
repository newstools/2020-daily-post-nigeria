FIFA has announced its decision to delay the transfer window and extending contracts of players whose deals are expiring until the end of the current season. A number of players are due to become free agents on June 30, officially the last day of the 2019/2020 season. But with the campaign not likely to resume until June at the earliest, FIFA has now called for the contract end dates to be pushed back. The world football governing body has also suggested the summer transfer window should fall between the revised end dates for the current season and the start of the 2020/2021 campaign. “With the current suspension of play in most countries, it is now obvious that the current season will not end when people thought it would,” FIFA said in a statement on Tuesday. “Therefore, it is proposed that contracts be extended until such time that the season does actually end. “A similar principle applies to contracts due to begin when the new season starts, meaning the entry into force of such contracts is delayed until the next season actually does start.” Addressing the issue of player transfers, the statement added: “With regard to transfer windows, again, it is necessary to adjust the normal regulatory position to the new factual circumstances. “Accordingly, FIFA will be flexible and will allow the relevant transfer windows to be moved so they fall between the end of the old season and the start of the new season.”

Chief Magistrate, Justice Ipalibo Iyiaboa of the Magistrate Court in Port Harcourt has remanded two female Evangelists, Celen Benneth Nwankwo and an Auxiliary Nurse, Faith Ugochukwu at the Port Harcourt Correctional Centre over the alleged murder of one Nmaku Iroegbu. Evangelist Celene and Faith are standing trial on a two-count of conspiracy and murder. They were arraigned by the Police for allegedly administering Dazipan and Norvas injection on the deceased, Nmaku, which lead to her death at Godâ€™s Dwelling Clinic and Maternity, Sonlife Avenue, Egbelu-Ogbogoro, Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. Evangelist Celene who narrated what transpired to the court, said she operates a Ministry Church where the pregnant deceased came for prayers but was referred to the hospital after showing signs of delivery but later died in the hospital after experiencing birth complications. The Auxiliary Nurse, Faith on her part, told the court that drugs were administered on the Late Nmaku in the clinic because of her high temperature (260/160) and was immediately referred to the Military Hospital where she passed on. But the Investigative Police office, IPO, in his oral evidence claimed that the test carried out on the deceased at the Military Hospital, Aba Road, Port Harcourt, showed that the injection administered to her by the auxiliary nurse affected her brain which led to her death. Ruling on the matter, Chief Magistrate, Justice Iyiabo said the court lacked the jurisdiction to hear the matter and ordered that the suspects be remanded in Correctional Centre, but added that in view of the pandemic situation, the suspects be remanded in SCID cell. Chief Magistrate Iyiabo referred the case file to the Director of Public Prosecution, DPP, for advice and adjourned to the 26th of May, 2020, for mention.

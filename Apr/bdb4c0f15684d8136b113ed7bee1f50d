As Nigeria and the rest of the world battle to curtail the novel coronavirus, Farm4Me, Nigeria’s number one Agritech Company has joined the fight against the global pandemic. This is just as the company has donated some preventive kits to Tse Amouka community in Gwer West LGA Benue State. CEO of the group, Adama J Adama, who made this disclosure on Wednesday, said the gesture is done as part of the company’s contribution to the fight against the deadly virus.  “Our passion is to bring positive social impact to our host communities,” he said. On why he donated preventive kits to the community, the young farmer said, “Coronavirus is real; there is no doubt about that. We need to do all we could to prevent it from spreading into our community. “Some of the precautionary measures advised by medical experts include wearing of facemask and constant sanitization of hands. We donated those items to help fight against further spread of the disease in our country. “We are also building a bridge that connects the agrarian community to another village as part of our corporate social responsibilities. We hope to do more as God empowers us,” Mr. Adama said. The outfit is on a mission to put smiles on the faces of smallholder farmers, create jobs for vulnerable women and youths and make decent profit for working class Nigerians. Adama J.

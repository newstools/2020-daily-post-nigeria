Former Tottenham Hotspur striker, Dimitar Berbatov has slammed manager, Jose Mourinho after the Portuguese broke UK government-imposed COVID-19 lockdown rules to hold a training session with three of his players. DAILY POST had reported earlier this week that Mourinho was pictured at Hadley Common Park with midfielder, Tanguy Ndombele, and defenders Davinson Sanchez and Ryan Sessegnon were also filmed by passers-by running together through the park. Mourinho has since apologised for his actions, saying: “I accept that my actions were not in line with government protocol and we must only have contact with members of our household. “It is vital we all play our part and follow government advice to support our heroes in the NHS and save lives.” Reacting to the development, Berbatov said Mourinho broke social distancing rules because he was ‘impatient’ for football to return. He, however, said that he was not surprised about Mourinho’s actions because the former Chelsea and Manchester United coach has always operated outside the box. “Jose Mourinho has admitted he was wrong to hold an informal training session with three Tottenham players on Hadley Common in north London,” Berbatov told Betfair. “He did it because he is impatient for football to return, and I understand that, but he’s broken the social distancing rules, and that’s not good. “Footballers and managers are in an influential position in society, and they need to set an example to their fans in this tough situation. “I cannot say I was particularly surprised by Mourinho’s behaviour. He has always operated outside the box, and that’s one of the reasons he’s been successful, and fans love him. But this is different.” Meanwhile, the Premier League has been suspended indefinitely since mid-March due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

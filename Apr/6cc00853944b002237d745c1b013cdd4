Serie A clubs have all agreed to play out the rest of the current season rather than cancel or end it at its current stage. The Serie A disclosed this in a statement on Tuesday after a video conference meeting with all the 20 clubs in the Italian top-flight league, according to Sky Sports. DAILY POST had reported that Serie A had been suspended since March 9 due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe. However, the Serie A general assembly on Tuesday met and with unanimous votes of all 20 clubs connected by video conference confirmed a continuation of the session. “The intention is to complete the 2019-2020 football season if the government allows it to take place. “The resumption of play would take place in compliance with medical protocols for the protection of players and all professionals.”

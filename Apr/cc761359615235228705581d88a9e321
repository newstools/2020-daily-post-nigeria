Barcelona midfielder, Ivan Rakitic, has criticized his club for trying to force his departure last year as COVID-19 continues to disrupt sporting events globally. Rakitic is currently on self-isolation after La Liga was suspended due to the spread of COVID-19. The Croatian international joined Barcelona from Sevilla in 2014. He has not been regular for the La Liga champions so far this season due to competitions from Arthur and Frenkie De Jong. The 32-year-old, whose current contract at Barcelona will expire in 2021, was among the players of the Catalan club who wants to leave Camp Nou. “I understand the situation, but I am not a sack of potatoes, which you can do anything with,” Rakitic told Mundo Deportivo. “I want to be somewhere I feel wanted and respected. If that’s here, then I’ll be delighted. But, if it’s somewhere else, then I’ll be the one who decides where not anyone else.” “Last year was the best of the six I’ve had here, and I was annoyed with how I was treated. I was shocked, and I did not understand it,” Rakitic added. “The results have not been the best, and I have not played much. That is why I felt hurt. “I had a bizarre first half of the season, and it was very uncomfortable and surprising for me. But I hope I can finish this last year of my contract.” Rakitic was recently linked with a move to Italian Serie A giants, Juventus.

Anthony Joshua has claimed he knew Tyson Fury could “expose” and “annihilate” Deontay Wilder. All the world heavyweight titles are with British boxers, after Fury was crowned as the new WBC champion following a stoppage win over Wilder in February. Joshua himself regained his WBA ‘super’, IBF and WBO belts with a point victory over Andy Ruiz Jr in December. “I believed Tyson Fury could potentially do what he did,” Joshua told Sky Sports. “I just felt like, Deontay Wilder is a formidable ex-champion and has a chance to come back, but I just knew that when he gets to the top level, it will be difficult, because it’s one thing getting there and it’s another thing staying there. “We’ve seen in some of his fights, it’s been difficult for him and then he lands his punch and he’s been victorious, but I always believe that when you go to war, you can’t have one weapon in your arsenal, which was his right hand. “Once that was taken away from him, which Tyson Fury did, I’m not going to go into tactics, but he was able to annihilate Deontay Wilder and expose him for some of his weaknesses. “Tyson Fury did a great job tactically and I’m looking forward to their rematch.”

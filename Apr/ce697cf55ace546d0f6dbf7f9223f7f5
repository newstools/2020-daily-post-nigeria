While we feel deeply concerned about isolated security incidents involving hoodlums and miscreants, I want to assure all Nigerians that your safety and security remains our primary concern especially in these exceedingly difficult and uncertain times. “As we focus on protecting lives and properties, we will not tolerate any human rights abuses by our security agencies. The few reported incidences are regrettable, and I want to assure you that the culprits will be brought to justice.” He also urged Nigerians to continue to cooperate and show understanding whenever they encounter security agents. “For their protection, I have instructed that the personnel of all the security agencies be provided with the necessary personal protective equipment against infection.” Meanwhile, Buhari earlier eased the lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States, with effect from May 4.

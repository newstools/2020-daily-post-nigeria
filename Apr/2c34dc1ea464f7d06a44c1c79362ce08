President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has confirmed that those who attended the burial of the late Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, were locked out of Aso Rock. Shehu stated this on his verified Twitter page on Sunday. According to the president’s spokesman, it is in standard rules put in place by the National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Federal Ministry of Health. “There is nothing extraordinary about those of us who attend Abba Kyari’s funeral being advised to distance ourselves from the Villa. “This is in line with the standard rules put in place by the National Center for Disease Control, @NCDCgov and the Federal Ministry of Health. You do these things to stop the spread of #Coronavirus. “For the most part, the Villa has operated digitally in the last few weeks so there is really nothing new to this,” he tweeted. The presidency has been the target of criticisms, since images of the crowd at Kyari’s burial went viral.

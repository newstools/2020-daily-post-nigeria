Minister of Health Osagie Ehanire, has warned Nigerians that COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms are still very highly infectious. The minister explained that mild symptoms in one person could be deadly infection in another. Ehanire spoke on Thursday, at the daily press briefing by members of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. The Minister said, “That is why we recommend the suspension of close contact between grandchildren and grandparents, at this time. “Our valuable health workers are urged to adhere to all government instructions and regulations; always utilise personal protective equipment (PPE); maintain a high index of suspicion for COVID-19; and protect yourselves, your loved ones and your colleagues.” He further warned that private hospitals handling coronavirus cases without government accreditation risk being sanctioned. He added, “I shall use this opportunity to again strongly advise health professionals against private or secret management of people who have COVID-19 outside of accredited health facilities. We cannot afford avoidable morbidity and mortality. “Private facilities must obtain accreditation to treat this highly infectious disease. Practitioners engaging in unauthorised treatment of COVID-19, run the risk of being shut down for decontamination. “This next phase of our strategy, due to the available evidence of community transmission in Nigeria, now focuses on the community. “There will be more community testing and social mobilisation at the grassroots to ensure physical distancing and advisories on the use of masks or improvised face coverings like handkerchiefs or scarves over the mouth and nose, to reduce risk of transmission. “Again, the revised case definition for testing includes: All patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome; Contacts of people confirmed to have COVID-19, with fever and respiratory tract symptoms; Persons with fever and respiratory tract symptoms of unknown cause.”

The Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, has admitted he probably contracted COVID-19 while in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory. El-Rufai stated this during a Hausa live media chat with selected radio stations in the state. The Governor who was diagnosed with the disease on March 28, became Kaduna’s index case and was isolated for 26 days before he recovered and was discharged, having tested negative twice on April 22. “I can’t exactly say how I contracted the coronavirus. But I was in Abuja and had interacted with many people, some from overseas. “I was assigned to chair committees by the government. I believe it was from these interactions that I got the virus,” El-Rufai said. El-Rufai on Sunday extended the quarantine orders being enforced in the state for another 30 days. The governor’s decision follows a recommendation to that effect by the State Standing Committee on COVID-19, chaired by the Deputy Governor, Dr. Hadiza Balarabe.

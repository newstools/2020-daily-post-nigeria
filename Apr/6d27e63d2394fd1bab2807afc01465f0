We are sending a consignment of additional PPEs and other materials to support the Federal Medical Center ( FMC), Umuahia. “The private clinic where one of these patients was treated is hereby closed to the public until properly disinfected, while all the doctors and nurses who attended to them still remain quarantined until the results of their tests come out.” Ikpeazu also stressed that all borders will remain closed, while encouraging citizens to always wear face masks and continue to practice social distancing. “Government will insist that all borders shall remain locked till further notice. “All our citizens should remember that wearing of face masks in Abia is compulsory. “Government will encourage all citizens to continue to practice social distancing and strict rules of hand washing as well as use of sanitizers.” He also said the government will embark on massive contact tracing of those that came in contact with the two index cases. “We shall embark in massive contact tracing across all the LGAs where these index cases have been associated with in the recent past.

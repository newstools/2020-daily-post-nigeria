President Muhamadu Buhari has directed the Central Bank of Nigeria to make plans for financial stimulus packages for Nigerians. Buhari made this known during a live broadcast on Monday. The president had earlier eased the lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States. He also assured that security and safety remains the primary concern. He said, “I have directed the Central Bank of Nigeria and other financial institutions to make further plans and provisions for financial stimulus packages for small and medium scale enterprises. We recognise the critical role that they play in Nigeria’s economy. “Our Security Agencies continue to rise to the challenge posed by this unusual situation. While we feel deeply concerned about isolated security incidents involving hoodlums and miscreants, I want to assure all Nigerians that your safety and security remains our primary concern especially in these exceedingly difficult and uncertain times. “As we focus on protecting lives and properties, we will not tolerate any human rights abuses by our security agencies. The few reported incidences are regrettable, and I want to assure you that the culprits will be brought to justice.”

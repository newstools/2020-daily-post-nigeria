The Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, Lagos State, has confirmed the death of a medical doctor in its isolation center. Recall that a Nigerian medical practitioner, Dr. Chugbo Emeka, on Wednesday morning, died of coronavirus-related complications after treating an infected patient in his private hospital. Prof. Wasiu Adeyemo, Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee (CMAC) of LUTH, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday in Lagos said “the doctor, who died at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital, was rushed to the facility on Monday after attempting to manage a COVID-19 patient in a private hospital in Lagos. “He was COVID-19 positive; we started him on drugs, but unfortunately, he died on Wednesday. “The doctor is not a LUTH staff; he was a private practitioner, though he trained in LUTH some 18, 20 years ago,” LUTH tweeted. Adeyemo added that LUTH medical personnel were well trained and protected in the ward on how to attend to Covid-19 related patients. He said, “Our staff in isolation wards, who care for the patients are well trained and well protected. “They wear the Personal Protective Equipment (PPEsl before they interact with the patients, whether suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19.”

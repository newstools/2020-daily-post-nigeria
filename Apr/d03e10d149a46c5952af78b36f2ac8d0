The African Democratic Congress (ADC) has berated the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government on the way it is handling the coronavirus pandemic, saying the ruling party is not doing enough to control the spread of the disease. Vice Chairman North East of the party, Manzo Mohammed Ibrahim in a statement issued in Bauchi on Tuesday, pointed out that the novel pandemic has triggered a change in all nations of the world, lamenting that the Nigerian government has not made adequate provision to bring succour to its citizens as they grapple with the deadly virus. “It has become a phenomenal incident that challenges virtually every stratum of human living and Nations. The big question is how prepared is Nigeria as a nation. “Nigeria’s health facilities are in a near collapse with outdated facilities, inadequate health personnel and poor working environment that need a total attention if they are to serve as health facilities that give healthy attention to citizens. This was as a result of the unprecedented negligence of the Health Ministry partly due to inherent corruption and mere attitude to government’s facilities, he s said. According to the party, social investment programs introduced by the federal government have no tangible results, alleging that the Conditional Cash Transfer, Trader Moni etc. have witnessed cases of graft and irregularities. The party cautioned that if the COVID-19 pandemic escalates, it will be so catastrophic to the country in view of the poor state of Nigeria’s health sector and alleged lack of serious measures to contain the spread of the virus.

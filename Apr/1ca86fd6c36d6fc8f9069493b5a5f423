The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has disclosed that people are being smuggled in trucks out of Lagos State despite lockdown order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Speaking at the daily briefing on Thursday, the national coordinator of the presidential task force (PTF) on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu expressed worry that movement of such persons could increase the spread of Coronavirus across Nigeria. He appealed to Nigerians to limit their movement as this could lead to inter-state transmission and increase cases of COVID-19 in other states. Sani said; “I will like to emphasize on travel restrictions and the need for people to stay at home, especially in the FCT, Lagos and Ogun. “The issue of inter-state travelling is a concern as we have noticed that community spread is now being traced to people travelling across state borders. “Nigerians need to restrict movement in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus. “This is particularly pertinent with regards to news of people being smuggled in trucks out of Lagos, which is quite a concern to us.” Meanwhile, the National Center for Disease and Control, NCDC on Thursday announced that 20 out of 36 states in Nigeria have confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Governor Simon Lalong of Plateau State has set up 10 mobile courts to try violators of the lockdown order instituted in the state. DAILY POST recalls that the state government on Monday declared a total lockdown from midnight Thursday 9th April to Wednesday 15th April 2020. The governor informed that mobile courts will be set up through the state Commissioner for Information and Communications, Dan Manjang, to ensure enforcement and compliance to the lockdown directive. He said the lockdown was instituted to allow for a statewide fumigation against coronavirus. He advised the public to comply with the no-movement order while those exempted because of their essential services are to carry their identity cards at all times. Lalong appealed to residents to bear with the government over the unusual situation and make sacrifices. ‘The problem is not peculiar to Plateau State but is a global challenge as the world battles this pandemic. While urging security agencies to be firm in enforcing compliance, the Governor warned them to “remain professional and observe all rules of engagement”. He further warned that any security personnel who overreaches his mandate by engaging in “corrupt conduct or brutality” will be held accountable.

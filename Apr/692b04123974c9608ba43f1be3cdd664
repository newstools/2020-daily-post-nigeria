A nutritionist and food researcher, Dr. Yeside Adesiyun, has advised Nigerians on foods to eat to help them maintain good health and protect the system against coronavirus. The Senior Research Officer at the Federal Institute of Industrial Research (FIIRO) in Lagos gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria. Adesiyun listed the groups of food as carbohydrates, fats, dietary fibre, minerals, proteins, vitamins, and water. “People need to utilize their knowledge of food groups in pairing their foods. For example, a meal of rice and beans provides you with all the essential amino acids and you do not need to add extra fish or meat. “Another example is Eba and Egusi soup. Egusi contains protein as well as fats, however, because the protein is not complete, adding tablespoons of ground dried shrimps will improve the nutritional quality of Egusi”, the official said. She added that in crisis situations, protein-rich foods, as well as fruits and vegetables, shield the body against diseases. “Protein-rich foods that include: beans, animal source foods like chicken, fish, shrimps, and egg provide a lot of micronutrients and prevent malnutrition so they need to be prioritized.” The expert urged Nigerians to stock dry foods that have good nutritional value or can have when properly paired such as beans, rice, groundnuts, egusi, garri, ogbono and crayfish.

Super Falcon forward, Francisca Ordega, has explained why she prefers a foreign coach to handle the Nigerian senior women’s national team than a home-base Nigerian coach. According to Ordega, a foreign manager has more exposure and understands the game better than a home-base coach. Since the exit of Thomas Dennerby, a foreign coach last September, the Super Falcons have been without a substantive coach, a vacuum that needs to be filled as they seek to defend their African title later this year. “I think home-based players always find it difficult to play under foreign coaches at first,” Ordega told SavidNews. “It is just the same way I had difficulty adapting to a foreign coaching system for the first time in Europe. “Having played under both a local and foreign coach, I would say I prefer foreign to our home-based coach. “Foreign coaches are more exposed and way ahead in terms of handling training, giving instructions, understanding the basics of the game, using modern training facilities, mentality, and have an honest relationship with players. “I am not saying the home-based coaches are bad, just that the foreign ones are more exposed and understand football better. “I am nobody to decide for NFF, and I am good to play under any coach, be it home-based or foreign. “However, if I am to choose, I will go with a foreign coach. “For the same reason, most Nigerians choose foreign products over home-based products.”

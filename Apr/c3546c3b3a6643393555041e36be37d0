The World Health Organization has declared that Coronavirus is far from over. The warning came as countries, including Nigeria, begin to relax lockdowns. WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, in a video on his Twitter handle, appealed that more work needs to be done. He said that as cases decline in Europe, countries must ensure they trace, isolate and properly treat patients. “The pandemic is far from over. I repeat, the pandemic is far from over,” Ghebreyesus said. He expressed worry over the increasing rate of the pandemic in Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia. Ghebreyesus stated that the pandemic will only be defeated if countries are united in the fight. “WHO continues to be concerned about the increasing trends in Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and some Asian countries. “But I repeat, national unity is the foundation for global solidarity. That is what we will say every single day. This virus will not be defeated if we are not united,” he added.

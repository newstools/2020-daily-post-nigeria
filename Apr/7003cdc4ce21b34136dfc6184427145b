Former National Publicity Secretary of the defunct New Peoples Democratic Party, nPDP, and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Chief Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, has described the palliative measures put in place by the Rivers State Government to cushion the effect of the COVID -19 lockdown as a serious embarrassment to the sensibilities of the good people of Rivers State. In a statement made available to media houses in Port Harcourt, Eze maintained that Rivers people deserve more than three cups of rice, few cups of garri and a sachet of noodle as palliative for each family after budgeting a whopping sum of two billion naira (N2B) in this regard. According to the State opposition party chieftain, “the State government food palliative intervention through its Committee headed by His Excellency, Ambassador Desmond Akawo the newly elected PDP State Chairman though targeted mainly to PDP members, are 3 cups of rice; 5 cups of garri; one sachet of noodles (indomie) for a family. “I would suggest that rather than humiliate and embarrass PDP members and citizens in such brazen manner and turn them to mere beggars, it would have been best if the government and its agents kept their money and allowed markets to open for free commerce. Families can fend for themselves above such humiliating and ridiculous degrees to which the state has subjected them,” Eze stressed. Eze further blasted the State Government for allegedly excluding the APC faithful from the palliative intervention and further stated that “the action of the State government has further exposed the ineptitude and recklessness of the PDP administration in attending and addressing issues of critical importance like public welfare etc. “

The Ganye Local Government Area in southern Adamawa has shut its markets ahead of a statewide lockdown being contemplated by Governor Ahmadu Fintiri. Fintiri had on Wednesday confirmed an index COVID-19 case in the state and asked the people to prepare for a lockdown to be announced in due course to prevent the spread of the virus. On its own, however, the Ganye Local Government Council has decided on a partial lockdown with the closure of its main market and an international cattle market within the council area. Ganye, headquarters of Ganye LGA, is a principal town about 145 kilometres south of the state capital, Yola. The Head of Information of the LGA, Kabiru Jida, said in a statement, “I am directed to inform the general public that due to the spread of COVID-19, the Ganye LGC has directed the closure of the Ganye Main Market, the International Cattle Market and other major markets in the LGA till further notice.” Indication by Thursday afternoon was that Governor Ahmadu Fintiri is only waiting to pay civil servants before declaring a lockdown following the outbreak of COVID-19 in the state. His Chief Press Secretary, Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, told DAILY POST during a phone conversation, “The governor has not declared a lockdown and has not stated any date for it.” Humwashi who spoke against public speculation that the expected lockdown may begin on Saturday said the governor appeared to be waiting for workers to receive their April pay before declaring the lockdown. In Adamawa State since the coming of Fintiri, civil servants have received their monthly salaries by the 25th of every month, which for this month will be on Saturday. It is not clear now whether the payment will be made Friday, April 24, to avoid having to pay two days late on Monday, April 27.

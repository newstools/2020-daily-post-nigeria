The Federal Government says it will work to ensure that there are no job losses or mass sack in Nigeria due to the coronavirus pandemic. Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige, said this on Thursday, in his May Day message signed by his spokesman, Emmanuel Nzomiwu. Ngige assured that the government would look at the four-pillar plan of policy responses to the pandemic laid out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). The minister disclosed that all relevant factors to the nation’s workforce would be identified, analysed and solidified to ensure job retention. He stated that the government would not encourage employers to disengage any member of their staff without the prerequisite social dialogue and clearance from the ministry. Ngige commended workers in the health sector for being in the frontline of ensuring that the raging pandemic was contained. “Over the years, May 1 has been a unique day in the world of work. It is a day dedicated to workers as partners in socio-economic development of nations,” he said. “The COVID-19 outbreak has affected modes of work and the utilisation of teleworking is on the increase. As you work from home, I urge you to do your best in that regard and to endeavour to demarcate your personal life from work,” he said. Ngige said that the Federal Government was not unmindful of the fact that businesses in both the private and public sectors had suffered. “Sustainability of the enterprise has become a subject of concern. The worries precipitated by the COVID-19 crisis are further compounded by worries of maintaining a source of livelihood.”, he added.

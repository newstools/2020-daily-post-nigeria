A Singapore-based Nigerian medical practitioner, Dr. Jonathan Obaje has recommended indoor exercise amid the coronavirus lockdown. He explained that this would enable them to maintain both physical and mental health. Obaje, the Vice President, Nigerians in the Diaspora Organisation (NIDO), Singapore chapter, gave the advice in a phone interview with NAN. He stressed that exercise was important as it would help people cope in the course of staying indoors as authorities battle the disease. The biomedical research scientist said, “Exercise more than ever is now most important in keeping healthy physically and mentally. There are simple indoor exercises we can practice at home. “Another health habit for this period is diet control. Eat as little food as possible because food eaten but not burned becomes poisonous to the body, leading to the feeling of anxiety, depression, and even aggression. “For people with pre-existing medical conditions, it could lead to escalation of the illness. “Play indoor games. Get ludo, cards, chess game to play with family. Also organise tournaments with family members if possible and less of watching negative news on TV.”

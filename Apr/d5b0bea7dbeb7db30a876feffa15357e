The Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) has confirmed that no player in the continent scored more goals in the history of Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) than Cameroon legend, Samuel Eto’o. CAF made this known in a post on its official website on Thursday. Eto’o, who retired from football in 2019, scored a record of 18 goals in six AFCON editions he played for The Indomitable Lions. He netted 56 goals in 118 caps for Cameroon national team. The striker is three goals ahead of Cote d’Ivoire’s Laurent Pokou, who has 14 goals. Eto’o has played for big clubs in Europe, including Real Madrid, Barcelona, Chelsea, and Inter Milan. The 39-year-old is widely considered as one of the greatest African footballers ever. He has won several trophies, including Champions League, AFCON, LaLiga, Serie A, Copa del Rey, Coppa Italia, FIFA Club World Cup, Supercoppa Italiana, Olympic Gold Medal, among others.

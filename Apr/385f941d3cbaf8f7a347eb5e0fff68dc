The German Football League (DFL) responsible for operating the Bundesliga and the second division in the country, is determined to finish the current season rather than cancel or end it at its current stage. DAILY POST had reported that the Bundesliga had been suspended since last month due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world. All 36 clubs in the German first and second division are now eager to return to action with plans to play spectator-free games in May. The decision was made on Thursday after a video conference meeting with all the clubs. “If we start on May 9, we are ready. If it’s later, we will be ready again,” DFL chief executive Christian Seifert said on Thursday, as quoted by BBC. “For us, what is decisive is what the politicians will decide. It is not for us to determine when. “Games without spectators are not what we want – but at the moment, it’s the only thing that seems feasible.”

Premier League giants, Manchester United have completed a deal to sign goalkeeper Radek Vitek from Czech Republic club, Sigma Olomouc. Vitek will join Man United as a scholar in July this year after his parent club announced a deal had been signed off by Fifa. Man United agreed on terms to bring the 16-year-old shot-stopper to Old Trafford in January but had to wait for paperwork to be signed before formally completing the deal. Speaking after Sigma announced the deal, Vitek spoke of his delight at finally becoming a Man United player. “It is a surreal feeling, a move to Manchester United is the dream of a lot of guys who start playing football,” Vitek told Sigma Olomouc’s official website. “I am really looking forward to it. I admit I didn’t even believe it when I found out about the club’s interest, but now it’s definitely a reality.” Vitek has already represented the Czech Republic at the Under-17 level. He has also been a regular in the Sigma youth set-up this season.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has asked the wives and girlfriends of his players, to keep them sharp during the coronavirus lockdown. Solskjaer is keeping in touch with his players via WhatsApp, with Premier League fixtures on hold because of COVID-19. Each player in the squad is being given an individual fitness programme to follow. However, Solskjaer has called on his players’ partners, to play their part by joining in with their training sessions and home kickabouts. “The players have got individual programmes, so this period could be used to work on something special, something specific for them. “I’ve been in the garden, with the kids, working on finishing and the strikers should be working on finishing or their movement. “Most of the players have got good facilities and decent gardens so, hopefully, their wives and girlfriends will be able to put some passes and crosses in,” he said according to the UK Mirror.

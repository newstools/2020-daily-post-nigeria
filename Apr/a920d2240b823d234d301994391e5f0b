Former Real Madrid midfielder, Luis Figo, has disclosed that he has forgiven former teammate, Ronaldo for a controversial comment about his wife, Helene Svendin. Ronaldo had once told Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez that he would always stay at home if he had a wife like Helene. “Florentino told me that I should stay at home more and not go out so much,” Ronaldo said. “He said I should look at Figo as an example to follow, and I said, with all due respect, that if I had a wife like Figo, I would also stay at home more. “I have spent more nights with Roberto Carlos than all the women I have been married to put together.” Reacting to Ronaldo’s comment, Figo, who was a special guest along with his wife, Helene on Spanish TV show, El Hormiguero, laughed off the Brazilian’s comments and confirmed they are still friends. Figo said: “I had already known about [the comment] because he had said it in the dressing room,” Figo said. “But I forgive Roni because he is always joking. “What he doesn’t know is that I would leave the house when my wife would fall asleep!” Figo made over 150 appearances for Real Madrid between 2000 and 2005.

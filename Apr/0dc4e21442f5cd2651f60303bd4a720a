Bako Wakil, Director of Technical Standards and Network Integrity, Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), says there has been no scientific proof that mobile telephone radiation were dangerous to human health. NAN quoted the expert as saying that the World Health Organisation (WHO) holds a similar position. Wakil spoke on Wednesday at a webinar organized by the Nigerian Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers to mark the 2020 World Day for Safety and Health at Work. The director explained that telecommunications masts do not pose health hazards as long as they are located properly and in accordance with approved guidelines. “A large number of studies have been performed over the past two decades to assess whether mobile telephones pose health risks. “To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile telephone use,’’ he said. Peter Ewesor, Managing Director of the Nigerian Electricity Management Services Agency (NEMSA) explained the hazards associated with electricity generation and distribution. The Chief Electrical Inspector in Nigeria warned that electricity abuse could cause avoidable accidents. Ewesor urged operators in the electrical and electronics industry to comply with safety guidelines. He harped on the the need for installations to be properly planned, executed, maintained and utilised to avert accidents, electrocutions, explosions, fire-outbreaks, loss of supply and power wastages.

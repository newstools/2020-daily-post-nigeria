Chelsea legend, John Terry, has revealed that Jose Mourinho threatened to sell him and Gary Cahill, after a poor training session. Mourinho had returned to Stamford Bridge for a second spell in 2013, looking to replicate his success with the Blues. He signed Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis that summer, as Chelsea went on to win the title. Terry has now spoken about how Mourinho made an example of him in training. The former England defender said on Instagram Live: “We won the league and came back pre-season, first day, me and Gary Cahill kept giving the ball away. “He stopped the session, we’d just signed Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa, a couple of others. “He said, “You two, I’ll go and spend £100m on a couple of other centre-backs if you keep giving the ball away.” We looked at each other and thought, “Oh wow”.”

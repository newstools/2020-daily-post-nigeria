The Inspector General of Police, IGP Muhammed Adamu, has announced that the newly recruited police constables, who are still undergoing training, will pass out on Friday, April 24. This was contained in a police wireless message sent from the office of the Inspector General to all Police Commissioners across the nation. The wireless message, with reference number, DTO: 141530/04/2020, directed all Commissioners of police to arrange the transportation of the constables out of the training schools. All Police Commissioners are to liaise with Commandants of police training schools in their states so as to arrange vehicles and escorts to convey the new police officers to their local governments of origin. This is in view of the Coronavirus pandemic, which has resulted in lockdown in most states of the federation. The IGP further directed that the new constables should be deployed to their respective local governments of origin. While ordering those concerned to ensure strict compliance, the police boss disclosed that names and force numbers of all the recruit constables will be forwarded to the Commandants through their official Email.

The Governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has admitted they might resort to mass burials, as a way to congest crowded mortuaries in the state. Sanwo-Olu, while giving an update on the COVID-19 pandemic on Saturday, explained that mortuaries are congested as a result of the lockdown. However, he made it clear that the deaths were not those of victims of the pandemic. Aside from the lockdown, Sanwo-Olu also linked the mortuary congestion to the recent Lenten period, during which many Christian bodies forbid burying their loved ones. “Because of this inability to hold funerals occasioned by the restriction of movement, our mortuaries in Lagos … we are now getting to the peak. And, there is a need for us to have a decongestion. “If we are not able to see decongestion of the mortuaries across the state within the next two weeks, Lagos State Government might be compelled to seek to have mass burials and we do not want to force this on anyone and that is why we are asking for cooperation,” Sanwo-Olu said.

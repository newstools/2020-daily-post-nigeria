Manchester United defender, Luke Shaw, has given reasons Liverpool should not be awarded the 2019/20 Premier League title following the suspension of the English top-flight league. DAILY POST recalls that Liverpool had 25 points lead ahead of second-place Manchester City with nine matches remaining before the Premier League was suspended indefinitely due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) world-wide. Shaw said that this season’s Premier League should be canceled if the campaign can’t be finished. With this, Liverpool will be denied their first title in 30 years. Asked if Liverpool should be awarded the Premier League title or whether the season should be voided, Shaw said during a Combat Corona Twitch FIFA competition, “Scrap the season and start again. Start it again, yeah. “If we cannot continue the season, then it is got to be void.” The 24-year-old continued: “Fans are so important. You realize it even more now. I think the sport is for fans really. Do you know what I mean? I think if you do not have fans, and you do not play in front of fans, it just does not feel right. “Especially on matchday, the fans are always amazing and always help the team. Whether it is home or even away, our fans are always brilliant, and I feel like they are always there with us.”

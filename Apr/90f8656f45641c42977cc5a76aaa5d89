The Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NiDCOM) has initiated its Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistant and emergency call lines for efficient communication with citizens abroad. It also disclosed that more than 2,000 Nigerians had expressed their willingness to return home following the Coronavirus crisis. A statement by its Head of Media and Public Relations Unit, Abdulrahman Balogun, on Wednesday, said the AI assistant or chatbot, is an automated messaging solution that encourages natural language processing. “Its algorithms (a set of instructions or codes designed to carry out a specific task) have been deliberately developed to assist Nigerians in the diaspora and Nigerians in general to access valuable information. ”The chatbot would always be available round the clock to provide quick and timely information to Nigerians in terms of inquiries about NIDCOM or the COVID-19 pandemic or any other necessary information. “Nigerians, anywhere in the world are one chat away from obtaining necessary information, particularly speedy and up-to-date news on various issues of national interest. “The AI assistant promises to be easy to operate and accessible via smart phones and other digital devices such as Personal Computers (PCs), Tablets and Desktops. “Meanwhile, NiDCOM has provided emergency lines through which Nigerians abroad can contact the Commission;+1234 222 2161
+1 888-644-2372.” The commission added that most of those are not Nigerians resident abroad, but Nigerians who travelled for one reason or the other and got stranded. On Tuesday, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Sadiya Umar, revealed the category of Nigerians that will get relief cash.

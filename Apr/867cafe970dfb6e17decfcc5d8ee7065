The Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has ordered the release of 26 inmates across correctional facilities in the state. The move is part of efforts towards decongesting the correctional facilities in a bid to contain the deadly coronavirus disease from spreading into the facilities. According to a statement signed by the governors Chief Press Secretary, Segun Ajiboye, “the order is in exercise of the powers conferred on the Governor by paragraph (d) of the sub-section (1) of section 212, of the Nigeria constitution (1999 as amended). “The said inmates are those who have served portions of their sentences after being duly sentenced to various terms of imprisonment. “The Governor believes that decongesting the Correctional Custodial Center will also help prevent the spread of the COVID-19, not only amongst inmates but also the officials.”

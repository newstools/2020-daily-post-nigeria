Governor Samuel Ortom has said fumigation of markets in Makurdi and other parts of Benue State will commence tomorrow. Ortom stated this Wednesday during a tour of Makurdi to ascertain the level of compliance with the stay-at-directive against the spread of Coronavirus in the state. He told some of the traders who were yet to comply with the directive not to return to the markets tomorrow as they won’t be allowed in, stating that the fumigation was in accordance with the World Health Organization’s advice to governments at all levels.  The Governor said he was impressed with the level of compliance at Makurdi Modern Market, urging traders in other markets across the state to take a cue from their counterparts at the modern market. He further stated that two isolation and treatment centres had been dedicated at Federal Medical Centre and Benue State University Teaching Hospital, Makurdi and advised anyone with persistent coughing, sneezing, high temperature and similar symptoms to go for test.  Governor Ortom, who was accompanied on the tour by some of his appointees and security heads in the state, visited Wadata, Modern Market, High Level, Wurukum and North-Bank markets.

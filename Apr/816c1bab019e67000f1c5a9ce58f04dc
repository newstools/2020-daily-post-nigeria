An Ibadan based-Islamic cleric, Sheikh Taofeeq Akewugbagold on Wednesday appealed to the abductors of his twins, for the release of the two children. Akewugbagold made the appeal while speaking with DAILY POST. DAILY POST gathered that the twin children, a male and a female were kidnapped at gunpoint at the Abatakan area in Ojoo, Ibadan, last Saturday. Public Relations Officer of the State Police Command, Olugbenga Fadeyi confirmed the abduction. Fadeyi in response to an SMS sent to him by DAILY POST said, “Yes, there was an abduction of Akewugbagold twins last night. “Efforts are intensified, arrests were made and they are currently assisting the police in investigations”. However, the two children have not been released as at the time of filing the report. Akewugbagold in a telephone conversation with DAILY POST noted that though the family has been contacted, the abductors are yet to demand any ransom. While explaining that about four suspects were arrested, Akewugbagold confirmed that those arrested are his workers, whom the police suspects. He called on the abductors to release his two children without further delay. “We have been contacted. They have contacted us. We pray that God touches their minds. “We don’t want to involve the police. I will not like to speak on the ransom. “Yes, police arrested some people, but they are my workers. They are not the abductors. But, we did not suspect anybody. “I am sorry I can’t speak on ransom. I don’t want to speak on that”.

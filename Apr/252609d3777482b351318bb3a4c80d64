The FA Council has ratified a decision to end the 2019/20 season for non-League divisions below the National League and National Leagues North and South, women’s and grassroots football, due to COVID-19. Last month, it was announced that the unfinished campaigns for divisions beneath the National League’s three tiers, as well as steps three to seven of the women’s game, would be expunged. This was met with resistance, as clubs, administrators and MPs called on the FA to think again. However, the decision has been rubberstamped, with the FA Council voting “overwhelming in favour” of it. “The FA Council has today ratified the decision to conclude the 2019/20 season across Steps 3-7 of the National League System, Tiers 3 to 7 of the women’s football pyramid and the wider grassroots game. “Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, The FA has been working collaboratively with the leagues within the National League System, the Women’s Football Board, the Women’s Football Conference, and the wider grassroots game to identify the most appropriate way to conclude the 2019/20 season at each level. “The request to end the 2019/20 season was taken to The FA Council by the representatives of the relevant committees having been fully supported by The FA Board. “The FA Council’s vote today was overwhelmingly in favour of ratifying the decision,” a statement from the game’s governing body read.

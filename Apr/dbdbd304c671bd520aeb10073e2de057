Manchester United star, Odion Ighalo, has named Juan Mata, David De Gea, and Sergio Romero as the three Red Devils’ players that helped him to settle down at the club. The 30-year-old joined Manchester United last January transfer window on a six-month loan deal from Chinese side, Shenhua. The former Watford star has scored four goals in eight appearances for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side so far this season. The Nigerian striker is presently on self-isolation after the Premier League was suspended indefinitely due to the Coronavirus pandemic. “I have a lot of guys there who have helped me. The guys in the dressing room are excellent,” Ighalo said during an Instagram Q&A session on Tuesday. “The first time I stepped my feet in that dressing room – wow. There are three players that took me and made me feel welcome and comfortable. “After three days, we started living like brothers, like I have been there for five years, laughing together and cracking jokes together. “Especially Juan Mata, De Gea, and the other goalkeeper, Romero, because they speak Spanish, and I speak Spanish.” Ighalo won the club’s March Goal-of-the-Month award after his sparkling effort goal against LASK in the Europa League.

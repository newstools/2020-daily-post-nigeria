Manchester United defender, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, has named Manchester City forward, Raheem Sterling, as the toughest player he has come across in his glittering career. The 22-year-old has been impressive for Man United since he joined Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side from Crystal Palace last summer transfer window. Wan-Bissaka had made 34 appearances for United before the 2019-20 season was suspended indefinitely due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Asked to name the “toughest” player he’s faced since joining Manchester United from Crystal Palace, Wan-Bissaka was quoted by Metro UK as saying: “I would say Raheem Sterling because I have the most battles against him. “He keeps going, just keeps on coming at you. It does not matter if he does not get past you in one challenge, he keeps coming back for more every time. “That is what I like. I have been happy with my performances in both league derbies, and the results both times were just what we needed. “The second one was just before lockdown, and that was an incredible afternoon. We were prepared for that game, and we showed that as a team on the pitch.”

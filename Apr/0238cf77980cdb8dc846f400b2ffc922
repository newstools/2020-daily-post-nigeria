Nigerians on social media have reacted to confirmation of 21 new cases of COVID-19 in Gombe State. Recall that the NCDC had while confirming that the country now has 1095 confirmed cases of disease, said it recorded 21 cases in Gombe State. Reacting, some Nigerians called for a total lockdown of the State as the curfew imposed was yielding no result. Others, however, urged the State governement to provide good measures to curb the spread. Here are some comments DAILY POST gathered: @Guaisehappy, “Are yoh wondering why Gombe got 21 new cases? Well If You Must know Gombe Government Imposes a curfew from 6pm – 7am instead of a 24hours total lockdown.” @nanale, “I’m saddened to know that with the rising confirmed cases in Gombe state.There is no testing center in the state, the governor has not put in place a total lockdown but a dusk till dawn curfew (6-7)” @Labellefu, “#80inlagos yet my worry is the number that will be announced for #kano. #Gombe already leaves me worried as #Katsina will record more.Who else already agree we shall have more states joining Lagos, Ogun and Abuja on compulsory #LockDownNigeria.” @jalowaziri, “Gombe is getting bad but I think their contact tracing is strong and have ramped up testing as well hence the jump in positive cases.” @Mikesdeyanju, “Gombe pulls out a shocker. Kano suffers a second straight defeat as many as they have gone since their rejuvenation.” @alhaji_maimoji, “Your excellency @GovernorInuwa, It’s high time you consider taking more serious measures to stop the spread of the virus. Within a week,Gombe has recorded about 30 cases. The number will keep rising(God forbid) if people are treated lightly. #lockdowngombe.” @jinikay, “Gombe are doing well for fishing out these cases. The ones that aren’t reporting anything are the most dangerous, similar figures should be expected from many states. Gombe can get ahead many states with their testing strategy and if they conduct aggressive contact tracing.” @Nedinaija, “So Nigeria has crossed the 1000 mark for Coronavirus. (Total = 1095).
What’s the back story to Gombe State having 21 cases in one day?” @Its_adj_jr, “ #Gombe ooo 21 New cases making the sum of 30 by NCDC and #CONVID19 having the total 1k+ at large.#Lagos Na them get the Lion share. What is happening.God safe us abeg.” @7wista, “@GovernorInuwa honestly I know you don’t tweet but this is suppose to get to you, Gombe needs a Total lock down for some days at least with the rapid increase in No. of cases before adjusting to the irrelevant curfew. #Covid19 #Gombe.” @Abdallahmissi, “It’s devastating seeing my beloved state, Gombe recording exponential cases of #COVID19. Just few days we had our index cases, today we have 30 — all within a week! Please let’s #StayHome and observe #SocialDistancingNow. May we all be safe.” @nnjida, “With over 20 cases reported yesterday in Gombe State, what is Mr. Governor doing/has done to minimize or stop the spread of the virus?” @Hgashua, And Gombe I wonder who you people are competing with in this covid race,y’all better stay home and relax because we still have grannies over there and we care about y’all.“

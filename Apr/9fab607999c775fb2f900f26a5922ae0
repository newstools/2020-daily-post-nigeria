Kyle Walker, the Manchester City defender who broke COVID-19 lockdown rules by ‘hosting sex party’ in his apartment, has apologized. Walker and a friend had invited two women to his flat in Cheshire last Tuesday evening, but earlier that day, the right-back had urged his 1.5 million followers on Twitter to observe the COVID-19 lockdown rules in place. “Please, everyone stay home, look after one another through this difficult time and check in on loved ones but don’t visit them,” he tweeted. According to The UK Sun, the England international, who was expected to be part of the manager, Gareth Southgate’s squad for Euro 2020 before it was postponed due to the Coronavirus pandemic, has now issued an apology for his actions. “I want to take this opportunity to issue a public apology for the choices I made last week,” Walker said in a statement. “I understand that my position as a professional footballer brings the responsibility of being a role model. “As such, I want to apologise to my family, friends, football club, supporters, and the public for letting them down. “There are heroes out there, making a vital difference to society at the moment, and I have been keen to help support and highlight their incredible sacrifices and life-saving work over the past week. “My actions are in direct contrast to what I should have been doing regarding the lockdown.” Meanwhile, reacting to the development, Manchester City stated that they would conduct an internal disciplinary procedure in the coming days. A club statement read: “We are disappointed to hear the allegations, note Kyle’s swift statement and apology, and will be conducting an internal disciplinary procedure in the coming days.” Man City is 25 points behind Liverpool on the Premier League table before the English top-flight competition was suspended indefinitely due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

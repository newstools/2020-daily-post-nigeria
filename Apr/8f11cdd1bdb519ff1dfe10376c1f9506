The Commissioner for Finance in Cross River State, Ekpenyon Ekpenyong Jnr, has said that the State is in danger of COVID-19 given her unique status of being a border State to other countries. Speaking at a press conference in Calabar, Cross River State capital on Friday, Ekpenyong lamented that the State shares common borders with Cameroon that is currently engaged in war and the refugees are being catered for by the State Government. “Cross River State is in a unique position in terms of geography. It has international and maritime boundaries which covered vast amount of areas with Cameroon. “Already, Cameroon are engaged in war, especially, the South-West Cameroon and over the last couple of months, the State has taken refugees numbering over 80, 000. These people are accommodated by us,” he said. “As at today, the confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Cameroon are 306, some Health facilities there are limited, and testing is limited, so we don’t rely on that.” He said, there are several deaths in Cameroon as a result of Coronavirus and that Cross River cannot overlook that. In addition, he added that the State shares boundaries with other states in Nigeria which exposes it to Coronavirus. “We have borders with about 4 States – Akwa Ibom, Ebonyi, Abia and Benue States. We have cases in some of these states and Cameroons, and we cannot take things for granted, and we call on relevant federal government agencies and security operatives to see how they can come and support the State because of our unique position,” he stated.

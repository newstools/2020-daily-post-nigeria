Contrary to his earlier position on the coronavirus pandemic, the Bishop of Owerri Archdiocese, in Imo State, Bishop A. J. V Obinna has asked the Catholic faithfuls in the state to tune in to Ozisa FM 96.1 for a live mass celebration. The cleric, it would be recalled, had earlier told the state government to exempt the Catholic faithful from the ‘stay at home’ order adopted against the Coronavirus, claiming that the church had sophisticated medication and experts to save them from the deadly disease. DAILY POST reports that the Catholic churches in the state, since the repeated announcements by the government on the closure of social activities, have been celebrating masses with ease, believing that the virus is not their portion. Meanwhile, the government will embark on a fumigation exercise across the nooks and crannies of the state with effect from today.

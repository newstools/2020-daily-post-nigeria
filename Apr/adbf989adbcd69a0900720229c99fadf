The Minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Muhammad Bello, says many COVID-19 patients have refused to be moved to isolation centres in Abuja. Bello announced that the FCTA will rely on the laws to mandatorily evacuate such patients. The decision was taken on Thursday at a meeting of the FCT COVID-19 Emergency Response Team and the FCTA Management. In attendance were Minister of State (FCT), Ramatu Aliyu, Permanent Secretary, Chinyeaka Ohaa, Ag Secretary of the Health and Human Services Secretariat, Mohammed Kawu, Director of Public Health, Dr Josephine Okechukwu, heads of the sub-committees and some top staff. Bello’s Chief Press Secretary, Anthony Ogunleye, in a statement quoted him as saying that the positive cases’ stay at home posed great risks to their families and communities. “Since we have begun to witness community transmission of the virus, it is imperative that we must do everything within our power to stop the spread even if we have to compel such persons to go to treatment centres. “In order to prevent further spread of the virus within the communities, it was resolved that massive testing will be carried out in areas where community transmission has been established, including Mabushi, Gishiri and Utako.” FCTA encouraged all residents to wear face masks when outside in the public. The minister thanked all the frontline workers and urged residents to comply with the social distancing directive.

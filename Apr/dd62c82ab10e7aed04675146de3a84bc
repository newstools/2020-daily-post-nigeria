Manchester City playmaker, Kevin De Bruyne, has named Liverpool forward, Sadio Mane as the player that should win the Premier League Player of the 2019/20 season. The annual Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) Awards would have been scheduled to take place on April 26, but have naturally been postponed along with the rest of the campaign due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe. But De Bruyne believes the Senegalese international deserves the award because he has been a complete package for Jurgen Klopp’s side this term. Asked on BT Sport who should win the award, De Bruyne said: “I would say, Mane. “I think he has been the total package for Liverpool this year. “He has been important, so if I had to choose somebody, I would choose Mane.” Mane has scored 14 goals and provided nine assists in the Premier League so far this season.

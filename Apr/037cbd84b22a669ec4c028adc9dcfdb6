Super Eagles goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho, has finally responded to fans and pundits who have made a joke of his real age over the past few years. DAILY POST recalls that Uzoho, who was the youngest player at age 19 during the FIFA 2018 World Cup in Russia, was criticized on social media over his real age, as most people believe he was older. But, Uzoho has now said that people who doubt his real age don’t know him. The 21-year-old said this when he appeared as a guest on the Super Eagles Instagram live session on Tuesday, AOIFootball reports. “I was smallish back then in 2013 when I participated in the World Cup with the U17 National team. I later went to Aspire Academy, where I learned a lot. “My looks and body build changed when I started using the Gym and was working out seriously. “If a lot of people see my picture back then, they won’t even talk about my age, but I don’t really bother because they don’t know me,” Uzoho said. Uzoho is currently on loan at Cyprus club, Omonia, from Deportivo La Coruna.

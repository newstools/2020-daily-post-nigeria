China has dismissed the call by Australia for an investigation into the origin of Coronavirus. Australia’s Foreign Minister, Marise Payne had called for an international investigation into the origins and spread of the deadly virus. Australia joined the US, United Kingdom and France who had all earlier shown concern over how China tackled the virus that first broke out in its central city of Wuhan in 2019. Coronavirus has caused nearly 2.4 million infections and more than 160,000 deaths worldwide, paralysing business activities in major cities. In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang said Payne’s remarks were “entirely without factual basis,” adding that questioning China’s transparency was unfounded and showed a lack of respect for the sacrifices of its people. “China expresses deep concern and resolute opposition to this,” Geng Shuang told reporters during a daily briefing. President Donald Trump has said on Saturday that China will face consequences if it was “knowingly responsible” for the pandemic. On Monday, China’s National Health Commission reported 12 new infections, taking the mainland’s tally to 82,747, while the death toll stood unchanged at 4,632.

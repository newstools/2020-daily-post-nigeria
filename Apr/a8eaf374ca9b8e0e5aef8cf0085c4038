Ogun State former Youths and Sports Commissioner, Bukola Olopade, said he has tested negative for COVID-19 after another two consecutive tests. DAILY POST recalls that Olopade, in a video on March 27, had announced that he tested positive for the virus and was taken into one of the isolation centres in Lagos State. On Wednesday, Olopade, in a new video said he was now free of the deadly virus, after three weeks in the isolation centre. According to him, his first video was mainly to be responsible to those he had contacts with before he was diagnosed, so they could get tested or isolate themselves. He said he would be discharged today to go home and see his family and loved ones. Olopade thanked God for sparing him through the psychological battle and the battle against COVID-19, both of which he said he had defeated. The former Sports Commissioner appreciated Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State, the Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof Akinola Abayomi and their team members for their efforts in fighting the dreaded Coronavirus pandemic. While commending the frontline health workers, Olopade described them as representatives of God on earth, saying they risk their lives to ensure others are safe. Meanwhile, Olopade urged all Nigerians to stay at home and observe all Coronavirus guidelines to stay safe, saying “COVID-19 is real.” Watch the video below:

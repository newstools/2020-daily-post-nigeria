The Delta State Commissioner of Police, Mohammed Hafiz Mohammed Inuwa, has cautioned officers and men of the State Police Command currently deployed for the enforcement of the lockdown and social restriction orders to ensure that the rights of Deltans were not trampled upon under any guise. CP Inuwa gave the warning in a statement signed by the state’s Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya He also said persons on essential duties duly exempted from the restriction orders, should be accorded due courtesies and unfettered access to and from their places of duty. The State Police boss equally charged Area Commanders, DPOs and Tactical Commanders across the state to ensure adequate supervision of personnel under their watch as well as due compliance with the standard operation guiding the special tasks. “The Area Commanders are also to ensure round the clock anti-crime patrols and surveillance around vulnerable targets such as medical facilities, shops and markets, residential areas, financial institutions and Automated Teller Machines (ATM) points amongst others so that criminals do not take undue advantage of the current COVID-19 to perpetrate crimes.” CP Inuwa expressed profound gratitude to Deltans for their resilience and voluntary compliance with the social restriction orders and cooperation with the Police at all times. He urged Deltans to observe all precautionary measures issued by relevant health authorities in order for the state to defeat the scourge.

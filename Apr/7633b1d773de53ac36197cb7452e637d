The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has reacted to reports that the Senior School Certificate Examination for 2020 has been canceled Reports had emerged over the weekend that the exam had been canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak. But speaking on Sunday, a statement signed by the Head of WAEC, Nigeria, Mr. Patrick Areghan, urged Nigerians to disregard publications on cancellation of the exam. Areghan also debunked reports that it was set to refund N22,500 to candidates who had enrolled for the examination as fake, false, and deceitful. “The publication is patently false and deceitful. It is nothing but the handiwork of mischief-makers, who are out to defraud innocent and unsuspecting candidates and their parents/guardians. “This piece of news is certainly not from the West African Examinations Council, WAEC. The examination was supposed to start in Nigeria on April 6, 2020 and not April 15, 2020, as stated by the authors. “The examination fee is N13,950 only, not N22,500. It is, therefore, not reasonable to refund candidates an amount higher than what they had paid to register for the examination. “WAEC, as an examining body in the sub-region, has not announced the cancellation of the 2020 WASSCE; it only announced a postponement until normalcy is restored. “We wish to use this opportunity to reassure all registered candidates, schools and other stakeholders that once the situation returns to normal, the Council will come up with a new international timetable for the conduct of2020 WASSCE in the West African sub-region, after due consultations with relevant stakeholders. “Candidates are, therefore, advised to disregard the publication and concentrate on studying hard for the examination.” Recall that the Nigerian government had last week postponed the Senior School Certificate Examination organised by the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) and the National Examinations Council (NECO) for the year amid the coronavirus outbreak.

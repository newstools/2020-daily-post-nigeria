FIFA has announced it will release $150million to its member football associations to help handle financial troubles caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. The president of the world football governing body, Gianni Infantino, made this known yesterday in a statement. According to Infantino, “All operational funding for 2019 and 2020 would be distributed amongst the 211 member associations in the next few days as the first step of a relief plan to assist the football community impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.” Each national governing body will receive $500,000. According to FIFA, the funds would normally be delivered upon “fulfillment of specific criteria”. The money comes from the Forward 2.0 programme, which was launched in 2016. It will provide $1.746billion in total over the 2019-2022 period.

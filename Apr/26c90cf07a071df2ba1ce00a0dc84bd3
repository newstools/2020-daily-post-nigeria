The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MCBAN, has appealed to Nasarawa State Government to allow partial operation in cattle markets to cushion the effects of the lockdown in the state. Alhaji Mohammed Hussaini, Nasarawa State Chairman of Miyetti Allah, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Lafia. According to Hussaini, beef is as essential as other foodstuffs like egg, rice, yam, and other government exempted food and pharmaceutical products. He said the association was in full support of the measures taken by the government to contain the spread of Coronavirus. “We will always support the government to ensure that the deadly virus ravaging virtually all nations of the world is contained. “So, even if the government allows cattle markets to operate, we will know how to control the crowd by deciding those to bring cattle every week and still maintain social distancing, provide hand sanitizers and face masks among others,” the chairman said. Meanwhile, Nigeria has recorded 665 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 22 deaths as of Monday night.

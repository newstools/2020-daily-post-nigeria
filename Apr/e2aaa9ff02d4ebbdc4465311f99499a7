Saudi Arabia has abolished flogging as a form of punishment. The country’s Supreme Court made the announcement on Saturday. The court explained that the “human rights advances” are part of reforms pushed by King Salman Bin Abdul Aziz and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It said the reform was intended to “bring the kingdom into line with international human rights norms against corporal punishment”. Al-Jazeera reports that court-ordered floggings in Saudi Arabia sometimes up to hundreds of lashes. They were applicable to convicts found guilty of offences including extramarital sex and breach of the peace to murder. Human rights groups have over the years condemned the practice.

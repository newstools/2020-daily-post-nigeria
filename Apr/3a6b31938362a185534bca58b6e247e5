He said the truck driver ran off after the offense, and that the Dangote Group has done nothing since then to empathize with the bereaved family. The NUADSS President asked the Dangote Group to “take responsibility for the action of their reckless driver and compensate the family of the deceased within the next seven days or face litigation. ‘We will have no choice but to resort to the court to get justice for our student.” Gaddafi said the deceased, Kamaluddeen Hussaini, died on March 3rd and was buried on the 4th, 2020.

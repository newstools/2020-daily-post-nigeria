Nigeria’s Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, has claimed the nine new coronavirus patients in Osun state entered into the country by road from Benin Republic. Ehanire made this disclosure at a media briefing in Abuja on Wednesday. The minister said the patients were originally coming from Cote d’Ivoire and had passed through Benin Republic. He said the vehicle carrying several people was intercepted and the passengers were isolated and tested. In a series of tweets on Wednesday, the Osun government confirmed the report. “The State of Osun has recorded an increasing number of confirmed cases in the past few days. “This of course isn’t a pleasant development but the good news is that the State is firmly on top of the situation. “The confirmed cases in the State isn’t a case of community transmission yet, but a situation of transmission within a controlled group. They are returnees from a neighbouring African Country who the State Government proactively received, isolated and tested,” it read. Osun has so far recorded 14 cases of the COVID-19, the third highest in the country.

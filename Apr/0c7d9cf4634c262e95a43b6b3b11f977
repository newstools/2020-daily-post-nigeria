The mysterious fire at the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) headquarters in Abuja on Friday consumed some documents. DAILY POST reports that the incident occurred Friday morning. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Fire Service, however, stopped the inferno from spreading to other parts of the building. An electrical fault at the section of the building housing the Election and Party Monitoring Department and the Media Centre, has been blamed as the cause of the fire outbreak. INEC National Commissioner for Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, claimed that: “Apart from some office furniture and equipment, nothing sensitive was destroyed.” However, pictures show that some files were destroyed. The INEC incident is the fourth fire outbreak in six months at key Federal Government offices. On April 8, some offices at the Accountant General’s office went up in flames. On April 15, there was an outbreak at the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). On October 28, 2019, fire engulfed a part of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS). Curiously, the federal government has not announced a probe of causes of the frequent occurrences. Nigerians only get similar unverifiable assurances from officials and agencies involved that all sensitive papers are safe. Photos of the burned INEC documents below:

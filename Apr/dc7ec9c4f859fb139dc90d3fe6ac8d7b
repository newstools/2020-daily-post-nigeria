Lorries conveying passengers from Kano into Kaduna State were on Monday turned back at the Kaduna-Kano border. Long vehicles, purportedly carrying food items, but transporting passengers into Kaduna were also turned back. The Kaduna State Commissioner of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, said the State government had put machinery at the border with Kano State to assess the level of compliance with the travel restriction. The development took place at Sabon Gida village of Ikara local government area, which borders Kiru local government area of Kano State. The Commissioner said that transporters abused exemption given to them and ended up transporting dozens of people hidden and well concealed in their vehicles. He emphasized, “The good thing is they have not entered Kaduna State and we will turn them back to wherever they came from.” The Commissioner added that they have turned back dozens of passengers, and would sustain the tempo in compliance with the Kaduna State government’s directives. The Commissioner explained, “We are having some problems with those beating security through remote areas with motorcycles, but we will go back to the drawing board.” The Commissioner was also at the border between Kudan local government and Danja local government area of Katsina State to ensure strict compliance to directives on full lockdown. At the Kaduna-Katsina border, Aruwan addressed security agencies and thanked them for their sacrifice in enhancing security and the fight against the COVID-19. The Commissioner in compliance to ensuring social distancing and avoiding large gatherings had earlier in the day dispersed hundreds of traders at a market situated at Kwanan Farakwai, Igabi local government area on the Kaduna-Zaria Highway. Several defaulters were arrested at the Kaduna State end of the border and handed over to security agencies for prosecution.

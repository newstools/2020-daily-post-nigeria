The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has promised to take care of health workers in the state amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Sanwo-Olu made this known via a tweet on his official Twitter handle on Saturday. He wrote: “Lagos will take care of its health workers. Thank you for always being ready, hardworking and passionate as we fight COVID19 and other medical conditions. “Thank you for your sacrifice even during Easter that allows other residents to stay safely at home. “We appreciate you.” The Governor’s pledge comes days after the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, approved the increment of hazard allowances for doctors, nurses, lab scientists, pharmacists, drivers and cleaners in Abuja. Lagos and Abuja have the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the country.

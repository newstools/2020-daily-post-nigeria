A 6-month-old baby, Erin Bates has tested positive for coronavirus disease in the UK, months after undergoing a heart surgery, Daily Mail reports. According to her father, Wayne Bate, Erin had undergone a heart surgery and after months of treatment with hopes of her getting a good chance of recovery, she got diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. He said, ‘‘People are still not taking this outbreak seriously and that upsets me. I take it personally. “Even before we went into lockdown, when we went into a supermarket we were anxious because our daughter is susceptible to viruses. ”‘But people still don’t seem to have any concept of personal space. ”My wife and I have been trying to conceive for 10 years after being told we won’t be able to have children, so when Erin came we were over the moon but now she is fighting for her life. ”She had open heart surgery in December and also suffered respiratory syncytial virus, which causes bronchiolitis and pneumonia in babies and can be fatal. “She then suffered tracheomalacia and bronchomalacia, which required use of the CPAP machine. ”‘There was a picture I’ve seen of a beach where there was an ice cream hut open with people queuing outside like it was a normal day. ”It horrifies me that people still are not sticking to the lock down measures. ”It does upset both of us.” Erin’s mother, Emma Bates also said she and her husband were heartbroken, stating that she fears they might lose the little baby. She said ‘‘Both myself and Wayne are utterly heartbroken yet again that we are in a position where we may lose our little girl if she doesn’t carry on fighting. ‘’Please, please, please keep Erin in your prayers. ”We can’t lose her over this virus. She has battled through too much. ”We need her, she completes us. ‘‘I hope that those who haven’t taken this virus seriously read this and I hope it now sinks in.”

Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State was on Friday, pelted with stones by some angry youths in Abeokuta, while distributing relief packages to cushion the effects of the ongoing Coronavirus lockdown on the people of the state. It appears the governor had decided to do the job himself, following complaints that the relief packages being distributed in the state did not get to the poor and vulnerable. Consequently, Abiodun led a team to an area called Oju Ogbara and Ago-Oko area of Abeokuta North Local Government around 6:20m on Friday, to hand the food items over to the target audience. DAILY POST gathered that Abiodun succeeded in giving the packages to some beneficiaries in Ago-Oko, while also doling out a sum of N200,000 to some ‘area boys’. An eyewitness told DAILY POST that the Governor, as he moved towards Oju Ogbara, was stopped by some angry residents of the area, who were chanting, “Dapo ebi n pawa”, “Amosun o fi ebi pawa” (Dapo, we are hungry, Amosun didn’t starve us). “In the blink of an eye, the angry youths started throwing stones. The Governor quickly escaped into his bullet proof G-wagon and he was driven out of the scene. “Two policemen were seriously injured with stones; the bus conveying the press crew was also destroyed and some pressmen sustained minor injuries,” the source told DAILY POST. It was gathered that Abiodun, who was angered by the ugly incident, left for his Iperu home immediately. Contacted, the Chief Press Secretary to Gov Abiodun, Mr Kunle Somorin, denied the incident. He told our correspondent that he was driving, promising to revert. He was yet to revert as at the time our correspondent filed this report.

Patrick Asomugha, a priest from Nigeria is set to leave a parish in Germany after receiving numerous threats against his life. Asomugha has been leading the parish of Saint Francis of Assisi in Queidersbach since August 2017, Dpa reports. A statement on Friday by the local diocese, disclosed that Asomugha will leave on April 20. “Concern for the protection and health of Pastor Asomugha makes this step unavoidable. It would be irresponsible to continue to expose priest Asomugha to this threat,” said Vicar General, Andreas Sturm. The diocese noted that since mid-2019, Asomugha has been subjected to several hostile acts. A death threat was left on his garage door in March, and two days later, two glass bottles, likely filled with alcohol, were smashed in front of his house. The rectory was also broken into twice, causing serious damage, and his tyres were slashed. “It’s not clear who’s behind these hostilities. For us, the most important thing is his welfare”, a spokesman for the diocese noted. Reacting, Asomugha said: “I can no longer fulfill my duties as parish priest under these circumstances. The attacks against my person make it nearly impossible to lead a normal parish life in Queidersbach.”

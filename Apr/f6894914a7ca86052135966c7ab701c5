Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Aviation Minister, has reacted to the removal of Maj. Gen. OG Adeniyi as the Commander of the Headquarters, Theatre Command Operation LAFIYA DOLE (OPLD) Maiduguri. The Nigerian Army on Tuesday effected a major shake up and released the postings and appointments of some senior officers. The posting was approved by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lt Gen TY Buratai. However, one of the senior officers affected by the shake up was Maj Gen OG Adeniyi, who was redeployed from Headquarters Theatre Command OPLD Maiduguri to NARC as Senior Research Fellow. Gen. Adeniyi was replaced by Maj Gen F Yahaya from Headquarters 1 Division Kaduna as the new Commander of the Headquarters Theatre Command Operation LAFIYA DOLE (OPLD) Maiduguri. Maj. Gen. Adeniyi’s redeployment may not be unconnected to a viral video where he was pleading with the government and the Chief of Army Staff to provide weapons for the soldiers in war front to do their jobs. Fani-kayode described the redeployment of Adeniyi as a pity. “The gallant commander who led our troops in Operation Lafia Doyle and who appeared in a video that went viral 2 days ago complaining about the conditions that his troops were facing on the war front with BH was relieved of his appointment yesterday. What a pity!” He tweeted.

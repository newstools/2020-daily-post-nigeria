Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has assured residents of the state that with faith, the COVID-19 pandemic will be defeated. This is as the state joins other parts of the country to observe a lockdown to curtail the spread of coronavirus. Governor Akeredolu stated this in his Easter message to Christians in the state as he assured that the people will sing a song of victory at the end. He also appealed to Christians to see the stay-at-home order as a sacrifice to contain the spread of the virus, just as Jesus gave his life to save the world. Akeredolu, while asking the people to emulate the virtues and preaching of Jesus Christ and celebrate Easter with moderation, added that the people will bounce back stronger from the pains inflicted by COVID-19 with the resurrection of Christ. The Governor noted that the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ is a strong message to the people that they will come out stronger after the defeat of the virus, and asked them to remain hopeful of a better future. He asked residents to join hands with the rest of the world to pray for health workers and others who are in the frontline in the battle against Coronavirus.

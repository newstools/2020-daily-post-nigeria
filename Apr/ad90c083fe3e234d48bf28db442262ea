Odion Ighalo has made it clear that he wants to remain at Manchester United, after his loan deal expires. The Nigerian striker moved to Old Trafford from Shanghai Shenhua on a six-month contract in January. Ighalo has gone on to impress with United, netting four times in all competitions for the Red Devils. Manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has expressed his delight with the 30-year-old, who was brought in after Marcus Rashford suffered a back injury. However, Ighalo’s deal is due to expire on May 31, which means United are likely to lose him either during, or before, the start of the rescheduled end to the currently suspended Premier League campaign. Shanghai are desperate to hang onto the forward and have set his asking price at £15million, while also offering him £400,000-a-week to convince him to reject United. But when a fan asked Ighalo if he would like to remain at United if he was offered a contract extension during a Twitter Q&A on Friday, he replied: “Of course”.

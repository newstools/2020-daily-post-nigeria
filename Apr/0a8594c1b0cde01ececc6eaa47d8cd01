Former Crystal Palace boss, Ian Holloway, has urged Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, to get rid of defender, Kyle Walker after the England star broke COVID-19 (Coronavirus) lockdown rules by ‘hosting sex party’ in his apartment last week. DAILY POST recalls that Walker and a friend had invited two women to his apartment in Cheshire last Tuesday evening, but earlier that day, the right-back had urged his 1.5 million followers on Twitter to observe the COVID-19 lockdown rules. “Please, everyone stay home, look after one another through this difficult time and check in on loved ones but don’t visit them,” he tweeted. Walker has since apologized for his actions over the weekend. Reacting to the development, Holloway, who paid tribute to Guardiola after the City boss lost his mother, Dolors Sala Carrio to Coronavirus, described Walker’s actions as ‘brainless’ . “First of all, I would like to send my love and best wishes to Pep as he’s lost his mum,” Holloway told talkSPORT. “The reality of that, and then you have one of your players [Kyle Walker]. It’s almost brainless. “What on earth are you doing having a party like that? It bangs out of order. “I would be looking to get Walker out of the club, that is not right, and it is so irresponsible from him.” Asked whether it should be the end of Walker’s England career, Holloway added: “Totally. It beggars belief. “Where’s the discipline? Where’s the actual discipline? “We’ll come back stronger… and a bit fatter.” “We miss football. We miss the life that we had a few days ago, but now is the time to listen, to follow our scientists, doctors, and nurses.” Meanwhile, England coach, Gareth Southgate, has reportedly ended Walker’s international career following the 29-year-old’s actions.

Chelsea have confirmed their players will not be taking pay cuts during the coronavirus crisis. The Blues, in a statement on Saturday, also confirmed non-playing staff will not be furloughed. Players have been in discussions over how they can contribute financially during the pandemic. But they will continue to be paid as normal. “Representatives of the Chelsea board have recently held extensive talks with the men’s first team to discuss how they can contribute financially to the club during the coronavirus crisis. “At this time, the men’s first team will not be contributing towards the club financially and instead the board have directed the team to focus their efforts on further supporting other charitable causes. As this crisis develops the club will continue to have conversations with the men’s first team regarding financial contributions to the club’s activities,” the statement read.

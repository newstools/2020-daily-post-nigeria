Residents of Jigawa state have defied state government order on the suspension of public gatherings as part of measures taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the state. Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar had announced that all gatherings at weddings, naming ceremonies and burial be temporarily suspended. Wedding fatiha is limited to only seven people, three each from the family of the bride and bridegroom as well as the Imam. Also, all weekly markets and borders with neighbouring states were shut down. But DAILY POST observed that residents, despite the order freely participate in all forms of public gatherings. One of the traders who spoke with DAILY POST at Sara Market in Gwaram Local Government Area said there was no way government can force them to stay at home without palliatives as they must take care of their families. On the issue of border closure, security agents were also accused of sabotaging government efforts by allegedly receiving bribes from motorists and allowing them to pass. The State Commissioner of Health and also the Chairman COVID-19 Tasks Force Committee, Dr. Abba Zakari said state government would deploy security personnel to ensure that people fully comply with the directives. He noted that whoever was arrested would be prosecuted for ignoring governmentâ€™s directives.

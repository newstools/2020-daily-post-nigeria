Belgian football chiefs have canceled the rest of the 2019/20 season and crowned Club Brugge champions of the Jupiler Pro League due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe, according to the Daily Mail. They voted unanimously for cancellation in a conference call on Thursday, and it is expected to be approved by the general assembly on April 15. Clube Brugge had a runaway 15 point lead at the top of the table with one round of matches left to play before the start of the post-season playoffs, involving the top six clubs in the Belgium top-flight league. “The Board of Directors took note of the recommendations of Dr Van Ranst and the government that it is highly unlikely that games with the public will be played before June 30,” the league said in a statement. “The current situation [Coronavirus] also makes it very unclear whether and when a resumption of collective training courses can be foreseen at all. “Even if matches behind closed doors could theoretically be possible, the additional pressure they place on health and order services should be avoided. “The Board of Directors has unanimously decided that it is not desirable to continue the competition after June 30. Given the above elements, the Board of Directors has formulated unanimous advice to the General Meeting not to resume 2019/20 season and to accept the current state of the Jupiler Pro League as final classification [subject to the decisions of the licensing committee].” DAILY POST recalls that all major leagues in Europe have postponed football activities due to the Coronavirus outbreak.

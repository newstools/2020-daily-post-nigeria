The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, has confirmed he met with the President of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ayuba Wabba, on Thursday. Mustapha revealed this during the daily press briefing by the task force in Abuja. Wabba had written a letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, warning of possible breakdown of law and order, if the ongoing lockdown was extended. However, Mustapha insisted there was no threat issued by the NLC. Instead, Wabba was suggesting ways forward in the national response efforts. “There’s no threat from Labour. As a matter of fact, the reason why I was slightly late for this press conference was because the President of the NLC, Comrade Ayuba Waba was with me. He had written a letter, quite alright. “He was also in the same manner, suggesting ways, you know they represent the working class, they also listen to what is happening, they see what is happening in different climes. Ayuba Waba is not only the President of NLC, he’s also the International President of the Labour Movement. “I believe that he’s consulting all over the world, listening to his workers in different countries and also taking experiences of how other nations are dealing with the lockdown because the entire world is on a lockdown. Some who had the infection earlier are beginning to ease out the lockdown, as they have succeeded in flattening the curve and they begin to move into bringing their nations back into productive sessions and also getting their systems back into life. “So there’s no threat from Labour, we are consulting with them. They have opinions that they share with us and at every step of what we have done thus far, we have kept contact with the working class, to ensure that at least, their views are adequately taken,” Mustapha said.

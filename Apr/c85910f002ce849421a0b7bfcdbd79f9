Nigerian singer, Innocent Udeme Udofot, popularly known as MC Galaxy, has reacted to the criticisms after he allowed a naked woman masturbate to win money during his Instagram Live broadcast. Since the lockdown, a number of Nigerian entertainers like Slimcase, Kiddominat, Baddyoosha, and MC Galaxy have been organizing Instagram Live videos where women twerk or perform sexually explicit acts to win money. However, on Friday night, a naked woman connected to MC Galaxy‘s Instagram Live video and masturbated in front of thousands of his followers. This attracted criticisms from Nigerians, including celebrities like OAP Dotun, Ireti Doyle, Ice Prince and Toolz. Toolz on her Twitter page wrote: “Ladies pls be careful with this twerking on IG live thing. You never know who is recording and holding on to the footage. Protect yourself.” Also, Ireti Doyle wrote: “In the coming years many will wonder why they can’t catch a break, they will blame it on village people and “haters”. Alas the demon will be in the digital footprint. “The world is literally at your fingertips, be mindful of what you’re putting out there.” But, MC Galaxy despite criticisms took to his Instagram page, announcing that sexual acts will be shown on his Live broadcast. He added that this time around, it will be the men going naked to win money. Sharing a photo of naked men on his Instagram, he wrote: “We set the trend, and they follow, am sure very soon they will copy me KING OF IDEAS.”

Acting President, Court of Appeal, Monica Dongban-Mensem has asked presiding Justices to adjudicate only matters of criminal and election petition appeals. DAILY POST learnt that part of the reasons behind the directive was because such matters were time bound in nature. The directive was contained in a statement from the Office of the Acting President, Hon. Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, issued to the Counsels and stakeholders. Also, Justice Dongban-Mensem advised that in compliance with the guidelines on COVID-19 issued by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Federal Ministry of Justice, as a way of observing Social Distancing in the Courts, appeals shall be called in few numbers at a time to avoid overcrowding. Part of the statement reads, “On our part we have provided the necessary soaps, sanitizer and hard-surface disinfectants to ensure compliance”. Further, it would be recalled that in adherence to a circular NO.NJC/CIR/HOC/631 dated 23rd March, 2020 issued by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, wherein guidelines were given in respect of the Global pandemic, the Acting President, Court of Appeal has asked Justices to expeditiously adjudicate only matters of uttermost concern and time-bound. He added that such matters include Criminal and Election Petition appeals. While commending her brother Justices for their support, the President of the Court of Appeal also observed that they have put on hold their workloads in their various Divisions, to determine time-bound appeals.

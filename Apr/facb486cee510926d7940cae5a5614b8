The Conference of Nigeria Political Parties (CNPP) has described the death of the Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Mallam Abba Kyari, as a big loss to the nation. CNPP urged political elites to always remember that life is vain and use it to serve the people who elected them into offices while they are still alive. In a statement issued in Abuja on Saturday and signed by its Secretary-General, Chief Willy Ezugwu, the umbrella body of all registered political parties and political associations in the country strongly advised citizens to comply with medical protocols on management of COVID-19 infection. “We are pained by the news of the death of the Chief of Staff to the President who was lost to the dreaded Coronavirus disease. “It’s about time the ruling class realized how vain life is and see every opportunity to lead as a rare privilege to leave a good legacy behind and be remembered for good governance. “No leader remains in office forever as there is an end to everything in life, including the reign of the king. “Therefore, we urge those of us who are in one position or the other to work to better the lives of the people. “Nigerians are suffering from the impact of the measures taken by both the state and federal governments to curtail the spread of Coronavirus pandemic. “As necessary as the pain is to ensure that more lives are not lost, governments across board must do more in cushioning the effects of the sit-at-home order on the already impoverished citizens. “We advise those corruptly enriching themselves from the COVID-19 palliatives measures to the detriment of the suffering masses to remember that there is always a day to return to one’s maker to give account”, the CNPP stated.

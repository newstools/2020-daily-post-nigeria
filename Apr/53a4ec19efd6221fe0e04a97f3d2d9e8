The United States-based Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), on Friday, condemned the harassment of Nigerian journalists. On April 18, police in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, arrested Chijioke Agwu, a correspondent with The Sun Newspaper, and held him for more than nine hours. In a separate incident on April 21, police in Ebonyi arrested Peter Okutu, a reporter with the Vanguard Newspaper, and held him for about two hours. They were released after criticisms by the citizens and the civil society. But, Ebonyi Governor, David Umahi, has banned them “for life” from the Government House and all state buildings. Umahi openly declared that journalists’ lives were at risk in the state and that he could not guarantee their safety His words: “If you think you have the pen, we have the koboko (horsewhip). Ebonyi people are very angry with the press and let me warn that I won’t be able to control them or know when they unleash mayhem on you, if you continue to write to create panic”. In its condemnation, CPJ told authorities in Nigerian to allow the press to do their work without any form of oppression. “Journalists in Nigeria must be free to report on topics of public interest, and must not be harassed, detained, and obstructed by local authorities,” said Angela Quintal, CPJ’s Africa program coordinator. “Amid the ongoing pandemic, Nigerian authorities must stop attacking the press and focus on ensuring the public has unfettered access to information.” CPJ, based in New York, promotes press freedom and defends the rights of journalists.

The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has welcomed the decision by President Muhammadu Buhari to ease the lockdown in Lagos, Abuja and Ogun States. Buhari, who addressed the nation on Monday night, revealed the lockdown will be relaxed from May 4. He, however, announced a two-week lockdown in Kano state. Reacting, SERAP queried Buhari over failure to address corruption in the distribution of palliatives. In a series of tweets on its official Twitter page, SERAP called on Buhari to order security and law enforcement agents to stop harassing Nigerians’ constitutional rights. The tweets read: “We welcome the decision by President Buhari on Kano, FCT, Lagos and Ogun States. “But the President failed to order probe into alleged grave human rights violations linked to COVID-19 and failed to address alleged corruption in the distribution of palliatives to Nigerians. “We urge President Buhari to urgently order investigation into human rights violations linked to COVID-19, and alleged corruption in the distribution of palliatives/reliefs to the poor and as well. Instruct security and law enforcement agents to respect Nigerians’ constitutional rights.”

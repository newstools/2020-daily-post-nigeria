The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Ogun 1 Area Command, said it has seized contrabands worth N1,177,161,384 in the first quarter of 2020, amidst Coronavirus pandemic. The Command also said it generated N37,878,000 in revenue from direct auctions of some of the impounded goods. This was disclosed on Friday by the Comptroller, Ogun 1 NCS Area Command, Michael Agbara. Speaking to DAILY POST on the scorecard of the Command for the first quarter of 2020 Fiscal year, Agbara said despite the fact that the year 2020 is globally surrounded with health and economic challenges, the NCS in Ogun I Area Command remains resolute and committed in ensuring that the critical functions of implementing Federal Government Policies are unabated. According to Agbara, “within the period of 1st January to 31st March, 2020, we have generated a total revenue of N37,878,000 from direct auction of seized 293,015 litres of PMS, 625 litres of Diesel and 19 Jerri cans of kerosene (25kg each).” He said all the seizures of petroleum products were meant for illegal exportation, which he said was in defiance to extant Federal Government policies. Doing a comparison of its performance in the first quarter of 2020 with that of the same period in 2019, Agbara hinted that there was a “tremendous increase by far margins in the numbers and Duty Paid Values of seizures in the first quarter of the year 2020 when compared to the first quarter of the year 2019.” From January to March, 2020, the Command revealed that it intercepted 145,951 bags of rice, 293,015 litres of petrol and 225 vehicles. This, it was gathered, was higher than what obtained in the first quarter of 2019 when it seized 12,720 bags of rice, 13,750 litres of petrol and 83 units of vehicles. In the spirit of interagency cooperation, the Command reportedly intercepted 176 sacks, 1,790 Parcels, 80 compressed books packs, 28 compressed coconut packs and four wraps of cannabis sativa (Indian Hemp). The said items, DAILY POST learnt, were seized by officers and men of the Command at various locations along the border areas in Ogun. Also, the Command Special Taskforce was said to have intercepted nine vehicles – seven Nissan Pathfinders SUVs and two Mazdas – fully loaded with smuggled parboiled rice. “It is important to bring to the notice of the public that during the COVID-19 lockdown, some daredevil smugglers ingeniously explored the difficult terrain with SUV vehicles to convey smuggled items into the country. The proactive activities of officers and men in the Command led to remarkable seizures of such categories of vehicles conveying smuggled items. “As a responsive and responsible Service, we remain resolute and focused in making sure that economic saboteurs are brought to their knees. “The Command wishes to commend the synergy existing between its personnel and Officers of Operation Ex-Swift Response (OSR), FOU Zone ‘A’, CGC Strike Force, Sister Agencies and other stakeholders. “Finally, I wish to once again reiterate our resolve to continue rendering our service to the public with utmost patriotism and commitment. It is our prayers and enthusiasm that the world will overcome this pandemic (COVID-19) and bounce back towards the path of good health and economic well-being,” Agbara stated.

A Delta State High Court, Kwale Judicial Division presided by Justice V. I. Ofesi, has set aside the judgment of the same court, nullifying the National Executive Committee meeting of the All Progressives Grand Alliance(APGA) convened on the 14th of May, 2019. Recall that aggrieved members of APGA and High Chief Ogonetus Okponetus, had in a Suit NO: HCK/40/2020, dragged Ozonkpu Victor Oye-led National Working Committee (NWC) of (APGA) before a High Court sitting in Delta State which nullified the NEC meeting of the party held in May last year. Subsequently, the legal team of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), commenced an intense legal battle through an application seeking to have the judgment set aside. However, in his ruling on 23rd of April, 2020, Justice Ofesi ruled that Delta High Court lacked the jurisdiction to preside over the suit, the subject matter of which took place in Anambra State. Reacting in a statement forwarded to DAILY POST on Sunday, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance(APGA), Ozonkpu Victor Ike Oye, described the verdict of the high court as a victory for democracy and rule of law. He said, “We should continue to work together for the peace, progress and growth of our great party. Our confidence in Nigeria’s judiciary remains unremitting and unshakeable. We thank our legal team for a job well done”.

Popular Nollywood actor, Richard Mofe-Damijo has called on the Nigerian Customs Service to distribute seized bags of rice and other goods to Nigerians amid the Coronavirus crisis. The 58 -year-old actor urged President Muhammadu Buhari’s Government to order the Customs to release seized food items to help feed Nigerians in this challenging period. The actor, also known as RMD, made the request in a post on his Instagram page appealing to Customs to step up and help Nigerians. The post read: “Sitting here wondering if this won’t be a good time for the government to ask Customs about all the plenty seized rice, tomato, vegetable oil, and all the other food items they have in their possession and give out to our people in need”. He further commended the government for reducing the fuel pump price but urged them to do more in regards to food supply as that is a major concern owing to the lockdown of markets. “While thanking them for the reduced fuel prices at this time (inject smiley face)and all the other efforts so far, food is a major part of this lockdown. “I know sometimes the agencies of government don’t work as a team but please, this is the time for customs to step and tell us how much relief they can bring to Nigerians.”

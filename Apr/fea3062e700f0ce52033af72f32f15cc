The tweet reads, “Attention, kindly disregard any cut off mark paraded by fraudsters. “It is fake news.” Recall that the exam body last month suspended all activities requiring physical contacts in all its offices and centres nationwide. The directive, which was contained in a statement issued by the board’s Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, stated that the development was in line with the professional advice of government on safety of all persons in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic around the globe. It urged all candidate to forward all enquiries and complaints to ‘support.jamb.gov.ng,” The 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) held between Saturday, March 14- 21st 2020.

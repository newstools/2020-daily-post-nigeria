The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned governments of European countries not to lift their lockdown and social distancing orders too soon. WHO’s Europe Regional Director Hans Kluge issued the warning on Wednesday at a news conference in Copenhagen, Capital of Denmark. Kluge noted that seven of the top 10 most affected countries around the globe are in Europe and remains at the center of the pandemic, NAN reports. According to him, “As of today, Europe remains very much at the center of the pandemic, on one hand, we have reason to be optimistic and on the other, to be very concerned. “Some good progress is being made in Spain, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.” Kluge, however, expressed worry about the rising number of cases in countries such as Turkey, Israel, Sweden, Finland, and Ukraine. He explained that there is still a long way to go, adding that it is not yet the moment to relax the tough social distancing restrictions that helped halt the spread of the virus in other places.

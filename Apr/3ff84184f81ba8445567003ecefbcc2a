The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has commiserated with President Muhammadu Buhari on the demise of his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari. In a Letter of Condolence signed by the president, Samson Ayokunle, CAN expressed sadness over the death. The body described the death as a ‘big blow’ to the administration and urged Buhari to stay strong. Ayokunle wrote: “We are particularly sad that he contracted the virus while on duty abroad. He has thus sacrificed his life in the course of service to his motherland. “That spoke much of his patriotic devotion to the greatness of our nation. We know this was a big blow to your administration, especially your kitchen cabinet. “Our prayer to the Lord is that he grants you, his family and the presidency, in general, the fortitude to bear the loss. ‘The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away, glory be to the name of the Lord.’(Job 1: 21) “May the Lord heal all others who are lying sick as a result of the attack of this ruthless virus. May the Lord grant our nation reprieve from the scourge of this virus very soon so that we might be able to pick up our lives and businesses again in Jesus’ name. “Be well assured that we at the Christian Association of Nigeria will continue to pray for you for enhanced wisdom and patience to lead a great country like this.”

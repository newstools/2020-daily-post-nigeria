Italy’s Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has announced that sporting activities in the country, including Serie A teams, would be allowed to resume group training from May 18, 2020. Conte said this during an extensive television address on Sunday, according to Italian newspaper, Corriere Dello Sport. “To allow a gradual resumption of sports activities, training sessions for athletes, professionals, and non-professionals recognized by CONI [Italy’s Olympic Committee] will be allowed from May 4, but only in compliance with the rules of social distancing, avoiding gatherings. “On May 18, we also plan to reopen the team training,” Conte said. DAILY POST recalls that the Serie A had been suspended since March 9 due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world.  Serie A clubs had all agreed last week to play out the rest of the current season rather than cancel or end it at its current stage.

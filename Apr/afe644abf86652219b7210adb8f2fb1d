The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has called for an inquest into the fire outbreak at the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, headquarters on Friday. PDP expressed shock over the disquieting fire disaster at the head office of the INEC in Abuja in which valuable equipment and documents related to electoral and political party monitoring were destroyed. In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the opposition party described the situation as “unsettling.” Recalling that only last Wednesday, the headquarters of the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation in Abuja was gutted by fire, followed by another inferno at the head office of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) just two days ago, PDP expressed worry over the current happenings. The statement reads: “Our party is deeply worried and hopes that this spate of fire outbreaks is not a coordinated design by sinister elements against demands for due process and accountability in our country, as already being insinuated in the public space. “We therefore restate demand for a forensic investigation into the fire outbreaks in the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation, the CAC and now INEC as the spate of occurrence has become alarming. “Furthermore, our party strongly charged the Federal Government to immediately ensure necessary precautionary and security measures to safeguard all our Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to avert such ugly incidences. “We note that our nation can no longer afford any more fire incidents in our key institutions as such will be distressing to the polity, which is already under pressure occasioned by dwindling economy and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.”

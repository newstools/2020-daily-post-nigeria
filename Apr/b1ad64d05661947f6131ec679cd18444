UEFA president, Aleksander Ceferin, has said there is “no way” Liverpool could finish the season without the Premier League title. Ceferin, speaking with Ekipa, however, admitted that if the remaining fixtures are canceled because of the coronavirus, there would be no option to null and void the season. Liverpool is currently 25 points clear of second-placed Manchester City with eight games remaining. The Reds are also desperate to win their first title in 30 years. “I see no way for Liverpool to stay untitled. If the championship resumes, they will almost certainly win it – theoretically, it has not yet reached the guaranteed level, but it is practically close. “However, if it could not be played, it would also be necessary to announce the results in some way and find some key on how the champions should be determined. And, of course, again I do not see a scenario in which that would not be Liverpool,” Ceferin said. He also added that he hopes the leagues in Italy and Spain resume soon. The Serie A and LaLiga are being played in two of the European countries most affected by the coronavirus.

A medical expert, Dr. Ifegbike Kalu, on Wednesday, said it is possible to contract Coronavirus from bodies of dead patients. Kalu, who is a Medical Doctor with the Federal Medical Centre, FMC, explained that COVID-19 which can be contracted from infected surfaces can also be picked from corpses. Speaking with DAILY POST, Kalu said: “Yes, just the same way the disease can last on surfaces at least for a while but not forever, it can last on dead bodies too. “If you make contact with the corpse of an infected person you should contract the disease if the virus is still alive and it’s on the surface, dead bodies, and everything.” This is coming at a time when the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, had confirmed new cases in the country, bringing the total of Covid-19 patients to 151.

The UK government says it is in talks with the English Premier League (EPL) on resumption of matches. The government said it was working on getting football back on the field as quickly as possible. Oliver Dowden, Culture, Media and Sports Secretary, spoke at a parliamentary questions session on Monday. “I personally have been in talks with the Premier League with a view to getting football up and running as soon as possible in order to support the whole football community. “But of course, any such moves would have to be consistent with public health guidance,” Reuters quoted Dowden as saying. The Premier League has been on hold since March 13. The suspension remains until May 7, when the government is expected to review the current restrictions. Already, Arsenal, West Ham and Tottenham Hotspur have opened their training grounds. On Friday, Premier League clubs will hold another conference call.

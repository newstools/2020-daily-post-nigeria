The Lagos State Government has withdrawn charges against Azeez Fashola, aka Naira Marley and a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Babatunde Gbadamosi. The duo were accused of flouting the COVID-19 lockdown order. They were among guests that attended the 42nd birthday party of Abdul-Rasheed Bello, aka JJC Skillz, the husband of movie star, Funke Akindele at Amen Estate on Sunday. Naira Marley and Gbadamosi were scheduled for arraignment on Wednesday at the Lagos State Magistratesâ€™ Court in Ogba. But a Defence Counsel, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, (SAN) disclosed that the government withdrew the four counts filed against the three defendants. He briefed journalists at the end of the proceedings. The lawyer said the charges were withdrawn on the condition that the defendants would tender an apology to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. On Monday, Funke and JJC were sentenced after they pleaded guilty to hosting an event that had over twenty persons in attendance. The offence was contrary to the social distancing directives made in pursuant to Regulation 8(1)(a) and (b) & 17(1)(i) of the Lagos State Infectious Disease (Emergency Prevention) Regulations 2020.

U.S President, Donald Trump, has promised to send at least 200 ventilators to Nigeria. This follows a phone call with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday. Nigeria’s Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, confirmed that Trump and Buhari spoke about the peculiarities of how the COVID-19 pandemic was being addressed in the African country. Speaking at a press briefing aired on Fox News, Trump confirmed that there were plans by the US to send ventilators from Florida to other countries. The Governor of Florida, Ron DeSantis, was also present at the briefing. “Ron said one thing that was interesting. He talked about ventilators and that ventilators were going to be a disaster in Florida and not enough and we sent them thousands of ventilators. But in the meantime, you have thousands of ventilators that aren’t used and we’ll be able to send them probably to other countries. “You’ll build up your stockpile because these other countries, Italy, France, Spain; we’re sending to Spain. I spoke today to Nigeria. They’ll do anything for ventilators. We’re going to send at least 200 ventilators to Nigeria; probably more than that,” Trump said.

Nollywood actress, Halima Abubakar, has claimed she used another woman’s picture to announce the arrival of her baby boy because he was delivered prematurely. The movie star is the subject of controversy on social media, for using the image of a US-based woman to announce to her fans that she had put to bed. Reacting to the criticism on Thursday, Halima explained the reason for her actions. “He (referring to the baby) will be discharged tomorrow from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). “I didn’t post because he was premature. God saved him. I just had to post this. For the people who didn’t see me, I have no close friends,” she wrote on Instagram.

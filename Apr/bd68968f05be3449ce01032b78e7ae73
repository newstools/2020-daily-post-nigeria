The Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Ebonyi State chapter, Mr. Chika Nwoba was on Wednesday arrested and arraigned in Magistrate Court sitting in Abakaliki, the state capital. He was arraigned for allegedly publishing statements on Facebook against the national leader of the party, President Mohammadu Buhari, the national chairman, Mr Adams Oshiomhole including the member representing Ezza South/Ikwo federal constituency, Hon. Chinedu Ogah. The defendant was arraigned on a charge bordering on giving false information capable of causing fear and panic to the members of the public including the party faithful. According to the charge sheet: “That you Chika Nwoba ‘m’ on the 6th day of December 2019 and 29th day of March, 2020, in Abakaliki in the jurisdiction of this honorable Court did publish on Facebook, statements against Hon. Comrade Chinedu Ogah, which are likely to cause fear and alarm to the public or to disturb the public peace, knowing or hearing reason to believe that such statements are false and thereby committed an offence punishable under section 59 (1) of the criminal code CAP. 33 vol.1, laws of Ebonyi State of Nigeria, 2009”. The counsel to the defendant, J.N Nweke, when the matter was called up for hearing, appealed the Court to grant the accused person bail on self recognition as the offence committed was bailable. In his submission, the Police Prosecutor, O/c legal, Ebonyi State Police Command, SP Ayeni opposed the appeal for bail for the defendant arguing that the life and safety of the accused can no longer be guaranteed, considering the nature of the crime he committed. The trial Magistrate, Nnenna Onuoha in her judgement granted the APC Chieftain bail with the sum of N100,000, and one surety in like sum; a letter of introduction from a traditional ruler stating that the accused is of good character and an evidence of current tax clearance. The case was adjourned to 25th May, 2020 for further hearing.

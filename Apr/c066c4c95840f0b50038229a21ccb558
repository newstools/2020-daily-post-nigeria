President Cyril Ramaphosa has sanctioned Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies, Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, after she violated COVID-19 lockdown regulations. Ndabeni-Abrahams was suspended for two months and will get only one month salary, the Presidency said in a statement on Wednesday. “As to the allegations that the minister violated the lockdown regulations, the law should take its course,” said Khusela Diko, the presidential spokesperson. The punishment followed the revelation on social media that the minister visited the home of a friend who hosted a lunch. Xinhua quoted Diko as disclosing that Ramaphosa summoned the minister on Tuesday to express his disapproval of her actions. The Spokesman added that Ramaphosa accepted Ndabeni-Abrahams’ apology for the violation but rejected her excuse. “The president has reprimanded the minister and directed her to deliver a public apology to the nation,” Diko said. The South African leader said he was satisfied that Ndabeni-Abrahams appreciates the seriousness of what she has done and that no one is above the law. A Minister in the Presidency, Jackson Mthembu, will act in her position. Announcing the nationwide lockdown, Ramaphosa called for absolute compliance on the part of all South Africans. “This must include members of the National Executive who carry a special responsibility in setting an example to South Africans, who are making great sacrifices,” he noted. “None of us, not least a member of the National Executive should undermine our national effort to save lives in this very serious situation”. Since the midnight of March 26, 20,000, people have been arrested violating the lockdown regulations. South Africa has recorded nearly 1,800 cases and 13 deaths. The Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) says there are now 10,252 coronavirus cases in 52 African countries.

Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has reacted to the viral video where two French doctors, Jean-Paul Mira and Camille Locht opined that the new COVID-19 drug be tested in Africa. Mira and Locht, who spoke in a live TV interview, which now has the highest trend on Twitter with the hashtag ‘Africans are not lab rats’ insisted that Africa is the best place to conduct such a test as they recalled how an experimental treatment for AIDS was carried out in Africa. Rudiger, who found the comments to be repulsive, took to his official Twitter account on Saturday to share the video, which has gone viral, saying: “It took me some time to find some words for these guys. “Angry face Two French doctors suggest on TV to carry on an experiment for the COVID-19 vaccine in Africa. “like the Africans are some sort of animals. Disgraceful! “This is racism at its highest level and a terrible statement against all the black-skinned. “How was this even allowed to be broadcasted on French TV?? #AfricansAreNotLabRats.” Meanwhile, Ivory Coast and Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba, has since reacted to the viral video.

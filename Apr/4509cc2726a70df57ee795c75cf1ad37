LaLiga president, Javier Tebas, has insisted that Barcelona are not negotiating deals for Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar or Inter forward Lautaro Martinez. Barca have been heavily linked with moves for Neymar and Martinez, with speculations rife they could land one or both. However, Tebas played down the rumours, saying the Catalans have other priorities. “It’s not true that Barca are currently in negotiation processes in the signing of these two players,” he told the Adea Conecta forum on Friday. “They are most focused on when the season can resume as opposed to new acquisitions. There will be swap deals in the short-term future, but transfers are not high on the priority of European clubs at present. “They want to limit the damage caused by the halt in activity, but everything is still on hold. No Neymar nor Lautaro, these names are not high on the priority list at present for Barca. “The club at present don’t have the capacity to make these signings, at present it’s completely impossible.”

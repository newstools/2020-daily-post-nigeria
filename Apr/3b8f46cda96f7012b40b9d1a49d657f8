Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Kola Ologbondiya, has alleged foul play by the Buhari administration after fire gutted some rooms at the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation in Abuja on Wednesday. Ologbondiya claims the fire is not unconnected with the call for a probe into subsidy payments made by the government since 2015 when Buhari became president. Recall that the building housing the Accountant-General’s office, also known as Treasure House was recently renovated. The cause of the inferno, which has since been contained by the Fire Service, is still unknown. FCT’s Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, says an investigation has already begun. But Ologbondiya, writing on his Twitter page, said: “We demanded a probe of the subsidy payments since 2015 that @MBuhari came into office and the next thing is fire guts Treasury House… Fraud!”

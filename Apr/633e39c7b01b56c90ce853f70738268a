Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has informed Nigerians that President Muhammadu Buhari was worried about their well-being amid the lockdown across many states. He assured that plans were underway to improve their welfare as the nation goes through a lull in economic activities. Osinbajo spoke on Friday after a meeting with Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Asked to comment on his engagement with the president as the head of the Economic Sustainability Committee, he said it was part of regular briefing. “Sometimes I come physically as you have seen me today, other times I brief him on the phone or by video conference. “What we are concerned about is how to ensure that the economy remains stable, that jobs are protected and if possible, more jobs are created.” Osinbajo disclosed Buhari expressed serious concerns about the problems that may be associated with the lockdown. “Many of our people work for a daily wage, they have to go out to work, so we have to think in terms of how to ensure that we are able to give them some succour during the period when they are not able to work. “Some of those issues are the issues Mr President wanted me to discuss fully with him. Of course, we have the Economic Sustainability Committee and shortly we are going to submit a full report to Mr President on our thoughts and ideas. “Mr President asked me to meet with him in particular to resolve some of the pressing issues around COVID-19 and also around the economic problems that we are seeing already,” he added. The nation awaits Buhari announcement’s on extension or relaxation of the current lockdown. The 14-day order, in effect in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun, expires Monday, April 13. However, the president is yet to disclose if the lockdown order would be extended.

Manchester United midfielder, Juan Mata, has described former Red Devils star, Michael Carrick, as the ‘most underrated’ player he has ever worked with at Old Trafford. Mata said this during an interview on the club’s official website on Thursday night. The Spaniard shared the same dressing room with Carrick before the former England midfielder retired from playing football in 2018. “Michael Carrick is the most underrated Man United player because I had a chance to play with him for a long time,” Mata said. “I know how important he is for a team. “For me, he was a fantastic midfielder, and, for some time of his career, he was under-rated or under-appreciated in the national team and for the club. “Because of the way he plays, this type of player is very appreciated in Spain. He probably would have been bigger than he was here.”

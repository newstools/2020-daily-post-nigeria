The Lagos State chapter of Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria has urged the State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to relax the lockdown order from Friday through Sunday. Chairman of the state chapter of the church, Snr. Supt. Apostle Joseph Olatunde Adagba explained that relaxing the lockdown order will enable both Christians and Muslims carry out their spiritual responsibilities to God. A statement signed by the General Secretary of the church, Evangelist Rotimi Odugbesan, Adagba claimed that God has plans to cleanse the land of all forms of illnesses. Adagba disclosed that God was ready to hearken to the voice of his children if they call on him beginning from Friday. The statement reads: “Through divine directive, God revealed that the Coronavirus was a mechanism of the devil to prevent His children from calling on Him at this time, but that time has come that God wants to hear our supplications regarding this virus. “So, God said that everyone, irrespective of race and religion should be allowed to gather and call on Him from tomorrow (Friday) through Sunday and that He was ready to listen to their voices and take away the ravaging Coronavirus. ”The Lagos State government should relax the lockdown directives so all children of God can call on Him in their mosques on Friday and their churches on Sunday.”

The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has described as shocking and sad the death of the Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba Kyari. In a condolence message on Saturday by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Lanre Lasisi, the Speaker said Nigeria had lost a patriot in the person of Kyari. Gbajabiamila said it was unfortunate that Abba Kyari died as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is now ravaging countries all over the world. According to him, Kyari would be remembered for his selfless and dedicated service to Nigeria right from his days as a private citizen through the time he served as the Chief of Staff to the President. Gbajabiamila added that with Kyari and other Nigerians’ death as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, the country needed to do everything possible to avoid further spread of the disease while taking care of those that tested positive so far. Also, Gov. Yahaya Bello of Kogi State sympathized with the people of Borno and President Buhari over the sad loss. “On behalf of my family, the government and the good people of Kogi, I commiserate with the entire presidency and the people of Borno over the loss. “Please, accept my deepest condolences on your bereavement,’’ the condolence message signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Onogu Mohammed, stated. Calling on Nigerians to emulate late Mallam Kyari, Bello said Kyari lived a good life. “He undoubtedly had been a pillar of support to you (President Buhari), in your exemplary journey since your assumption of office in 2015 as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “His (Kyari) wise counsel to you in the course of your selfless service to the people of Nigeria will not be forgotten easily. “While I pray the Almighty Allah to give you the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss and grant late Kyari eternal rest, please accept my heartfelt condolences,’’ Bello told Buhari.

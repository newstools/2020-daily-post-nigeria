Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford, has welcomed Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, to Old Trafford. Rashford, who is close friends with Sancho, wants the 20-year-old to make a transfer move to join the Red Devils. “It would be good [if Jadon Sancho joined Man Utd],” Rashford told Bleacher Report. “Sancho is a great player. He’s like the new generation player. “It’s exciting to watch the player he’s becoming, and hopefully, we can all play together. “That would be good. Sancho plays off the cuff. He’s imaginative. I think in this generation, they’re the things you need to be world-class.” DAILY POST reported that Sancho has drawn the interest of Man United in the past few days. Man United are willing to offer Sancho the no.7 shirt, in a bid to lure him to join the club this summer. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men are believed to be leading the race to sign Sancho from Dortmund for a club-record fee.

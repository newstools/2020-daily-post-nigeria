The Adamawa State Chairman of National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE), Alhaji Hammanjulde Gatugel has regained his freedom. The NULGE Chairman who was kidnapped from his home in Mayo Belwa in the early hours of Saturday, was released about the same time on Sunday. “Alhamdulillhi, at last, was released by the dare-devil kidnappers about 12:30am today (Sunday), but for now I can’t tell how much was paid as ransom before he was released,” a source said. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, Suleiman Nguroje, confirmed the development, saying Hammanjulde Gatugel was released unharmed. He downplayed a question on whether ransom was paid by the family members, attributing the NULGE chairman’s release to effort of the police. According to him, a hot chase mounted by the police frightened the kidnappers into releasing their victim. Nguroje had shortly after Hammanjulde Gatugel’s abduction on Saturday announced that four men had been nabbed in connection to it. He had explained that the suspects were arrested by the State Command of Anti-Kidnappers Special Unit deployed in the area to rescue the NULGE chairman.
He had said, “In an effort to rescue the kidnapped NULGE chairman, the Commissioner of police,Audu Madaki, had deployed operatives to go after the kidnappers and ensure the victim is rescued unharmed and culprits apprehended. “Pursuant to that, the command apprehended one Sunday Innocent 33, Buba Kaijo 37, Sanusi Shehu 20, and Tercher Buwa 44, along Kojoli town in Jada LGA “The suspects confessed being among the notorious kidnappers that are terrorising people in Mayo-Belwa, Jada, Ganye and Toungo Local Government Areas.”

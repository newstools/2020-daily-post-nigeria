Former Manchester United defender, Mikael Silvestre has claimed that midfielder, Paul Pogba’s head is not at the club anymore. He also disclosed that he would like to see the 27-year-old team up with January signing, Bruno Fernandes, in the Red Devils’ midfield. DAILY POST recalls that Pogba, who is widely expected to leave Man United at the end of this season, has drawn the interest of Real Madrid and Juventus in the past few months. Pogba’s current deal at Old Trafford will expire at the end of next season. The France World Cup winner is currently recovering from ankle surgery and has been out of action for several months. “We have to wait and see, but it doesn’t look like Pogba’s head is at United anymore,” Silvestre said on a podcast for The Athletic. “I saw Pogba before the lockdown, and he looked happy. Everyone is behaving like normal with him. “He is part of United, so if he were to stay there wouldn’t be an issue, I hope we see the best out of him. “He should be at his peak right now with his age and his experience with United and France. It would be nice to see him in midfield with Bruno Fernandes.” Meanwhile, the Premier League is currently suspended indefinitely due to the spread of COVID-19 across the globe.

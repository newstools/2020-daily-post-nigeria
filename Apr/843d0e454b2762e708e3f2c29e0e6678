Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has decided against triggering a 12-month option in midfielder, Paul Pogba’s contract. According to the Daily Star, Woodward has placed a £70million asking price on the France World Cup winner. Man United are still willing to sell Pogba this summer transfer window. The Red Devils are happy to negotiate with interested parties for the 217-year-old but will not openly invite bids. Pogba has drawn the interest of Real Madrid and Juventus in the past. His current deal at Old Trafford will expire at the end of next season. He is currently recovering from ankle surgery and has been out of action for several months. Meanwhile, Former Manchester United defender, Mikael Silvestre, has claimed that Pogba’s head is not at the club anymore. “We have to wait and see, but it doesn’t look like Pogba’s head is at United anymore,” Silvestre said. “I saw Pogba before the lockdown, and he looked happy. Everyone is behaving like normal with him.”

Top rank boxing promoter, Bob Arum, has insisted Deontay Wilder will not accept money, to step aside from his third fight with Tyson Fury. Wilder is set to face Fury in a trilogy clash in October, after triggering a rematch clause following his seventh-round stoppage defeat in February. There have been suggestions that an offer from Anthony Joshua’s camp would convince the American to forgo the bout, to allow for an all-British showdown for the undisputed heavyweight crown. However, that might not happen soon, with Joshua set to defend his world titles against Kubrat Pulev. Fury’s co-promoter, Arum, has also placed further doubts on the possibility. When asked about any chance of Wilder stepping aside, Arum told iFL TV: “Absolutely none. Wilder wants to fight Fury again. He’s not indicated to us or anybody else that he would be willing to step aside. “A further question is who is going to pay him to step aside? And, anyone on our staff has not even raised the possibility with us. So as far as we’re concerned, we’re thinking ahead to a third Fury–Wilder fight.”

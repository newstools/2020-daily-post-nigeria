Abdul Sule, agent to Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has warned the Red Devils that they could lose the Nigerian star to top European clubs this summer transfer window. Ighalo joined the Old Trafford club last January transfer window on a six-month loan deal from China side, Shanghai Shenhua. The former Watford striker has scored four goals in eight games for United so far this season, and Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is open to keeping Ighalo beyond the end of the season. But Sule believes the likes of Real Madrid, Manchester City, Barcelona, and Chelsea will be ready to sign Ighalo if Man United does not act quickly to sign him permanently. “I see Odion Ighalo earning a big-money move from top European clubs when his loan expires at Manchester United,” Sule told Goal. “I do not think Man United are keen on retaining him because they seem not to value him enough to hand him a regular place. “He also may not be wanted again when Marcus Rashford is fit. “I will not advise him to return to China now despite the attractive offer but would urge him to stay in Europe. I won’t be surprised if Chelsea, Manchester City, Real Madrid or Barcelona come for him. “He has proven that he is got a lot to offer at the highest level within his short stay at Man United, and he can attract big brands and earn more money, playing in any of the top teams in England. “He can always still return to China later in his career, but right now, I think he has what it takes to shine in Europe.” Meanwhile, Ighalo recently revealed why he is yet to receive an offer from Man United on a permanent deal.  “There is no offer on the table yet,” Ighalo said. “Because the season is still on, and I am yet to finish my loan deal. I do not just make decisions alone in my life. “I have a principle, and I have a guideline for everything I do. I always pray to God to direct me.”

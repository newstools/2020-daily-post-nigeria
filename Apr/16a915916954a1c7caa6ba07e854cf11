Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has reacted to a viral video of Nigerians in Guangzhou China being sent out of their apartments and treated poorly by some Chinese officials in China. DAILY POST recalls that The Federal Government had invited the Chinese Ambassador to Nigeria, Zhou Pingjian, over reports of maltreatment of Nigerians in China. The Minister said he urged the ambassador to speak with Chinese authorities to intervene on the matter. Reacting, Kayode took to his Twitter account on Friday to condemn the act calling on the Nigerian Government to reciprocate the same actions meted out on Nigerians in China to the Chinese in Nigeria. He said, ”Foreign policy & diplomacy is based on reciprocity and mutual respect. ”Based on the way the Chinese Government is treating our people, I call on the Federal Government of Nigeria to arrest the same number of Chinese citizens that are here, seize their passports & quarantine them indefinitely!”

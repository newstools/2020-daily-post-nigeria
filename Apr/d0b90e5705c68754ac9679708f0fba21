The Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has lambasted the Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, for making a u-turn on his decision that the Christians should meet on Sunday to celebrate Easter. Akeredolu had earlier temporarily lifted the ban on religious gathering in the state, in order for Christians faithful to converge on Churches on Sunday for the Easter celebration. Just today, the governor on his Twitter handle announced the cancellation of the Easter services. Reacting in a statement sent to DAILY POST on Saturday, Giwa described Akeredolu’s decision as cowardly, saying, “He is a coward, and I don’t think a coward can produce a good leadership. Why did he allow himself to be fooled that someone was tested positive of COVID-19? “He should have verified the report himself as a governor before making a U-turn.”

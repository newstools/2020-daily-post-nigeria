The Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, has claimed the Easter weekend will be the hardest for the agency. Ihekweazu, speaking during a press briefing of the Presidential Task Force in Abuja, admitted it would be tough to celebrate Easter with a lockdown in place. He, however, urged Nigerians to continue to support the Federal Government in the fight against COVID-19. The NCDC boss said, “We are socially intense people, we live on social interaction; we are known across the world for our music, our dance, our drama. “We hold our religious gatherings very dear to our hearts and there is no weekend more important for Christianity than this weekend. “There is no weekend that Christians are called upon to come together than this weekend. So, there is no weekend that will be hardest for us, the Christians amongst the Nigerian population, than this weekend. “So, I really call on all of us – Nigerian Christians, Muslims, and whatever the religion that you have, we need to pay a short term price for a long term goal and physical distancing is probably the most important tool.”

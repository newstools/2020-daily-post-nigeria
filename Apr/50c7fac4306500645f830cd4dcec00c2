The World Health Organisation (WHO) has disclosed that the UN’s health agency is working with affected countries on strategies for gradually and safely easing stay-at-home restrictions occasioned by Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, disclosed this at a news conference in Geneva on Friday. According to Ghebreyesus, WHO would consider essential factors while working with affected countries on easing the restrictions. “First, that transmission is controlled and second, that sufficient public health and medical services are available, and third, that outbreak risks in special settings like long-term care facilities are minimised. “Fourth, those preventive measures are in place in workplaces, schools, and other places where it is important for people to go; fifth, that importation risks can be managed. “And sixth – and I cannot over-emphasize this point – that communities are fully aware and engaged in the transition. “Every single person has a role to play in ending this pandemic,” he said. He, however, warned the affected countries against lifting restrictions too quickly. “I know that some countries are already planning the transition out of stay-at-home restrictions; WHO wants to see restrictions lifted as much as anyone. “At the same time, lifting restrictions too quickly could lead to a deadly resurgence. “The way down can be as dangerous as the way up, if not managed properly,’’ he said. Meanwhile, the global death toll from the COVID-19 has surpassed 100,000. The figure, which was released by Johns Hopkins University, said there are nearly 1.7 million cases, with more than 370,000 recoveries.

Barcelona manager, Quique Setien, has decided that attacking midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, still has a future at the club amid interest from Chelsea. He also ruled out any possibility of Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar returning to Barcelona. Asked about Coutinho’s future at Barcelona, Setien told RAC1 on Wednesday evening: “I think Coutinho is a great player, I like him. “He is still a Barcelona player. You have to pay the clause or pay a sum to Barcelona. “I think he can be here at the beginning of next season. I have to talk to him to ask him.” Asked about a potential Barcelona return for Neymar, Setien added: “I like all great footballers, there are a dozen in Europe who are extraordinary. But I like the ones I have too.” Meanwhile, the Spanish La Liga and other major leagues in Europe are currently suspended due to the spread of Coronavirus across the world.

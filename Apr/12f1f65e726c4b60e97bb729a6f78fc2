The Federal Government has said the COVID-19 test results of the 15-man Chinese medical team that flew into the country over two weeks ago is not ready. The Minister of State for Health, Dr. Adeleke Mamora, stated this on Friday during the daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force in Abuja. The Chinese medics, who came to offer technical support to Nigeria in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic, completed their mandatory 14-day quarantine on Wednesday. Their samples were then taken for testing by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). “For one reason or the other, we do not have the test results of the Chinese yet. I want to assure you that once we have the result of the tests, we will inform the country about the development. “I will advise all Nigerians to be patient because the government is also anticipating the result of the tests to ensure that we protect the health and wellbeing of every citizen of the country,” Mamora said.

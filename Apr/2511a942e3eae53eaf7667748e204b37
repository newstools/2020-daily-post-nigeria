Governor Nasir El-Rufai has congratulated the Muslim community in Kaduna State on the commencement of Ramadan. He appealed to Muslims to see the special circumstances under which Ramadan is being observed this year as a necessary sacrifice to safeguard public health. In a message to mark the commencement of Ramadan, Governor El-Rufai in a press statement by his Special Adviser to the Governor (Media & Communication), Mr. Muyiwa Adekeye, expressed gratitude to Allah for His Mercy even in this difficult moment. He urged Muslims to pray for the country, peace in the land and the containment of Covid-19 as they observe the discipline of fasting, worship and spiritual renewal in the holy month of Ramadan. The governor commended the commitment of Imams and other leaders of faith to ensure that the activities connected to Ramadan are conducted without mass gatherings and congregational worship. He described this rational approach to the practise of faith as exemplary. Malam El-Rufai said that the severe challenges posed to lives and livelihoods make it impossible to relax the quarantine conditions at this time. He expressed confidence that if the necessary sacrifices are made now, and everyone observes public health advice such as social distancing, regular hand-washing with soap and water, wearing face masks in public, avoiding large gatherings and the practise of respiratory hygiene. Then, we will be nearer to fully containing Covid-19.

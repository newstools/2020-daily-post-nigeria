The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Kaduna State chapter has hailed the decision of the state government to relax the 24-hour curfew to enable residents to buy more foodstuff as they continue to stay at home. A statement signed by the State PDP Publicity Secretary, Abraham Alberah Catoh, advised the state government to open more distribution centres for palliatives in a bid to cushion the effect of the lockdown. The party noted, “In order to ensure that the relief materials are well distributed to reach those they are intended for, we advise Government to use every Tuesday and Wednesday for this exercise.” The party explained that to avoid gathering of many people in a particular centre, many centres should be identified and made known to the public. “This will ensure transparency in the distribution exercise. The public should also support the Government by being orderly in their behaviour,” the statement added. The party called on Nigerians not to ‘cash in’ on the present global calamity for personal gains, stressing that the public outcry on the rise in cost of essential materials, especially food items, was becoming very unbearable. It said this time ”is the time for people to be their brothers’ keepers,” saying that government should be supported by all patriotic citizens to control unreasonable and unrealistic increase in prices of these commodities by selfish traders. PDP, therefore, called on members of the public to continue to respect government directives and obeying medical advises issued from time to time by the state COVID-19 committee. “We pray for the quick recovery of all victims of the virus and the world at large,” the party said..

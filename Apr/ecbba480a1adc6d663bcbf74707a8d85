Akwa Ibom State Governor, Mr. Udom Emmanuel on Thursday evening ordered total cessation of movements and the prohibition of all events for 14 days in the State. The order came following the confirmation of five suspected cases of Coronavirus in the state. The Governor, who announced this in a statewide broadcast, said the directive became important to enable a thorough process of contact tracing to identify those who may have been exposed to the five confirmed victims. He explained that the COVID-19 suspects, mostly healthcare professionals who are in good health with no symptoms, have been moved to the State isolation centre for proper management. According to the statement, “There will be no movement of persons, except those on essential duties who must carry a proper means of identification on them at all times. “All business premises, markets, shops, motor parks and offices except grocery shops and pharmacies, must remain closed during this period.” He said that the relevant security agencies have been briefed to ensure strict compliance with the directive. He warned against panic and fear, and enjoined the cooperation of all rather than resort to blame games. “What we need to do is to stay at home, practice social distancing and good personal hygiene, provide accurate and useful information to health workers whenever necessary,” he said. He said the virus can be contained if movements were restricted and advised anyone experiencing any of the symptoms of the illness or who had useful information on potential carriers, to immediately call the available emergency numbers.

The Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, has chided the Presidency for not maintaining social distancing during the burial of President Mohammadu Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari. National Leader of BNYL, Princewill Chimezie Richard, in a statement to DAILY POST berated the Presidency for breaking the lockdown rules in Abuja. The group reminded the Federal Government of the ban placed on public burials wondering why Abba Kyari was buried at the period of the lockdown. “What examples are they showing to the masses, they declared lockdown, banned burial activities yet they are breaking the rules,” the statement said. “All those that attended the burial including those that carried the corpse might have been infected by Coronavirus, since they said he died of COVID-19 and not diabetes he has been battling before the outbreak of the virus”. Nigerians on social media had earlier berated the Presidency after a video showing Garba Shehu, Buhari’s Spokesman in a crowd when the body of Kyari arrived at the defense guest house in Abuja on Saturday. The burial had more than the recommended 20 people in attendance and the role of social distancing was also broken. The late CoS died of COVID-19 in Lagos State on Friday and was disclosed by the presidency on Saturday morning.

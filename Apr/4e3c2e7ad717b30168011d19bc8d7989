The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, PENGASSAN, has directed its members to stop operations at all export facilities and suspend production and maintenance services from midnight today. PENGASSAN also directed its members to withdraw all forms of services relating to crude oil production, refining, distribution and supplies from 12 noon tomorrow. The directives are contained in a letter by the National President of PENGASSAN, Comr. Nduaka Ohaeri circulated in the media. Ohaeri said their action is sequel to the refusal of the Rivers State Police Command to release the twenty-two ExxonMobil staff arrested last week. The Association said it was obvious that the Federal Government cannot guarantee the access to work location of their members. PENGASSAN said the directives will remain until their members were guaranteed safety by the Federal government. Copied in the letter are the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment, the NNPC GMD, Inspector-General of Police, DSS, Department of Petroleum Resources and International Oil Companies.

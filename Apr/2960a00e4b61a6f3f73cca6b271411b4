The police in Ogun State have arrested a 43-year-old man, Joshua Abraham, for allegedly stealing a new born baby’s placenta. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident. According to Oyeyemi, Abraham was arrested following a report at Ibafo police station by one Raliha Zakara, the grandmother of the baby. Zakara was said to have told the police that the accused person, who is her close neighbour, went to the hospital, where her daughter was delivered of the baby, pretending to be the father of the new baby. Consequently, he demanded for the placenta from the nurse on duty and it was given to him, having claimed to be the father of the baby. Abraham, after receiving the placenta, went away with it, on the pretence that he was going to bury it. However, when the grandmother, Zakara, got to the hospital and was informed that the suspect had taken away the placenta, she was said to have quickly confronted Abraham, who told her that he had buried the placenta. Oyeyemi disclosed that, “When the grandmother insisted that she should be taken to where he buried it, it was discovered that he has hidden the placenta but buried a dead rat.” The DPO, Ibafo division, SP Abiodun Ayinde, was said to have detailed his detectives to the scene where the suspect was arrested. The police spokesman said the suspect has once been arrested for defrauding a police officer and a pastor of a huge sum of money under the pretence of procuring Canadian visa for them, adding that the case is being prosecuted in court. “He has since taken the detectives to where he hid the placenta and it has been recovered,” Oyeyemi said.

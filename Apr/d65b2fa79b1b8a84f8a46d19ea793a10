The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday said there was no approved vaccine for COVID-19. WHO Immunization Team Lead, Dr Fiona Braka, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that researches are still ongoing on the deadly viral disease. She, therefore, described as ‘untrue claims of vaccines developed for the COVID-19. Recall that China had last week approved early-stage human tests for two experimental Coronavirus vaccines. The vaccines are being developed by Sinovac Biotech and by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, an affiliate of state-owned China National Pharmaceutical Group. But, Braka said none had been approved for COVID-19, adding that public safety was the key consideration of WHO campaign for now. “COVID-19 is a new disease, and as such, there are no ready vaccines available to be deployed for the control of the pandemic. “However, a lot of research and scientific works are ongoing to develop vaccines, but these usually take time to ensure that it is safe for use on the broader population and also effective for control of the pandemic. “Public safety is a key consideration in this process,” the WHO team lead said. “WHO is not aware of vaccine for COVID-19 in Nigeria. “There is a large scientific study (clinical trial) involving many countries to review the effectiveness of some drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 going on at the moment. “The result of this clinical trial will help understand the efficacy of these drugs and may inform the review of the case management guidelines,” she added.

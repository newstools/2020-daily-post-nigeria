Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, has claimed that Cristiano Ronaldo left the club for Real Madrid because he did not like the weather in England. Ronaldo swapped Old Trafford for Spain in 2009, costing the LaLiga giants a world-record fee at the time. Neville admits the squad never tried to convince the Portugal captain to stay. “I think because he did the interview after the 2008 final where he sort of alluded to the fact that he was going, it was almost like you had an advanced warning. “So you were almost ready-prepared for it, you knew he was leaving the year after. It was coming, it was obvious that one day he would want to go and experience Madrid and La Liga,” Neville told Sky Sports.

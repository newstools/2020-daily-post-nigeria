The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has called for investigations into the fire outbreaks at the Accountant-General of the Federation’s office and the headquarters of Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) in Abuja. The NYCN, in a statement signed on Thursday by its President, Solomon Adodo, noted that thorough probes were needed to unravel the causes of the fire outbreaks. “We urge the government to do a full-scale investigation, using the right professionals and security agencies to determine exactly what led to the fire incidents,” Adodo noted. “If it is a case of sabotage, those guilty should be made to bear the consequences of their dastardly acts, as the fire that gutted particularly the AGF’s office had raised concern in many quarters. “Some have alleged that funds donated for management of COVID-19 pandemic had been diverted and that the building was set ablaze to destroy documents and records of the social intervention transactions during this period.” He urged the Federal Government to remain committed to addressing the challenges posed by COVID-19 and ensure that all donations made towards the containment of the pandemic were judiciously and transparently applied. “We hereby call on the Federal Government to ensure judicious and transparent utilisation of all the donations and ensure that palliatives get to the citizens worst hit by the lockdown.”

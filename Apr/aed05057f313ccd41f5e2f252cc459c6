The Kwara State Government has refuted insinuations that consumption of Nigeria’s local delicacy, Amala, cures COVID-19. Permanent Secretary in the state Ministry of Health, Dr Abubakar Ayinla, refuted the claim yesterday in Ilorin, the state capital. Speaking during the daily routine meetings of team of the Kwara COVID-19 Technical Committee in the state, Ayinla warned against fake news. He stated that a Risk Communication team has been set up to manage the circulation of fake news as regards COVID-19. Stressing that the Risk Communication team was set up to allay fears of misconception, Ayinla said: “COVID-19 has no cure for now, Amala can’t cure it.” Meanwhile, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria now stands at 373. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, made the disclosure yesterday while confirming 11 new cases of the virus in the country. The 11 new cases were all confirmed in Lagos State.

The Director-General of the NCDC, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, has said that 5 to 15 percent of COVID-19 patients will fall severely ill and die while 95 to 98 percent will recover depending on where they are. He said that many patients are asymptomatic and will recover but are only kept in isolation and treatment centres to prevent transmission to others as much as possible. Ihekweazu stated this at the daily press briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on Wednesday. According to him, “95 to 98 percent of patients will recover from the Coronavirus illness irrespective of medical intervention but depending on where they are. “Many patients are asymptomatic and will recover. “The only reason we are keeping them in isolation and treatment centres is to prevent transmission to others as much as possible. “5 to 15 percent depending on where they are will become severely ill and some will unfortunately pass away. “Every state is at risk right now. So the idea that moving from one state to another qualifies you to be at higher risk really is no longer the case. “The measures recommended globally is the same measure we recommend for everyone. “Therefore, whatever measures we have to do, we have to do it collectively – whether you are in the North, South, East or West.”

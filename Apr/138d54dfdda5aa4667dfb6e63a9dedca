The Chief of Army Staff (COAS), Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, has charged troops to brace up for the final defeat of Boko Haram and ISWAP. Buratai addressed troops of Operation Harbin Kunama IV at Army Special Forces Super Camp Ngamdu in Kaga Local Government Area of Borno on Thursday. The troops on training at the Army camp at Ngamdu were urged to prepare for the conclusion of the war against insurgency in Nigeria. Buratai told them not to allow the recent setback experienced deter them from defeating the terrorists. “As you all know, we have been on this ground for long and I expect us to remain resolute, selflessly committed and push for the total defeat of the Insurgents in the coming days”, NAN quoted him as saying. “I assure you that what is remaining is very small but it will require us to put more effort, more determination and more courage to complete the remaining part of the battle soon. “Recall that recently, we had setbacks which must not be allowed to happen again. We will not allow any further casualties both in men and equipment.” Buratai confirmed that the Nigerian Army had taken delivery of more equipment and platforms that would be deployed to various theaters of operations across the country.

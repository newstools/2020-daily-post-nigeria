The crime rate in Yobe has reportedly increased despite the lockdown in the State following the outbreak of Coronavirus. Residents say armed robbery and burglary have become the most lucrative crimes and are now on the increase since the lockdown. Most residents claim the continuous lockdown of economic activities informed the increase in crime particularly burglary as many youths who survive on daily pay jobs currently have no source of income or feeding. When DAILY POST spoke with the Police Public Relations Officer of the Yobe State Police Command, ASP Dungus Abdulkarim, he noted that farmers/herders clashes, rape, unnatural offenses, and other minor crimes have reduced, but armed robbery, burglary, kidnapping, and theft has been on the increase. According to ASP Dungus, in the first quarter of the year, the command arraigned over thirty (30) suspects for prosecution, while some of the suspects were convicted, others are still undergoing trial.

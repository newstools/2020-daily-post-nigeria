The Deputy Governor of Kano State, Dr. Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna, has tested negative for coronavirus. Gawuna’s samples were taken after the Co-Chairman of the Kano Coronavirus Taskforce Committee Professor Abdurazak Habib Garba and six other members of the committee were tested positive for the novel Coronavirus. Consequently, Gawuna went into self-isolation after making contact with those that tested positive. The result of the test, however, returned negative Friday evening. Reacting, Gawuna said, “We will continue to pray for Allah’s protection against COVID-19 everywhere in the world and for the quick recovery of all those already infected.” Gawuna also commended the people of Kano State for complying with the lockdown order while emphasising that the administration of Dr.Abdullahi Umar Ganduje was taking all necessary measures to halt further spread of the disease in the state. He urged the general public to maintain social distancing, washing and sanitizing of hands regularly and to comply with all other advice given by medical experts.

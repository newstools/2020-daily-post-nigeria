The Ogun State Government has confirmed that two other persons from the state tested positive for Coronavirus. Governor Dapo Abiodun disclosed this on Monday, at a press conference he addressed at his personal residence in Iperu. Abiodun informed that one of the cases is from Mowe, in Obafemi Owode Local Government Area of Ogun, while the other hailed from Yewa South Local Government. With this, Ogun State now has six cases of Coronavirus, three of whom have been discharged after they tested negative. Abiodun added that the two new cases proved that each of the three senatorial districts in Ogun has had at least one case of the deadly virus. The Governor expressed worries that the new cases are people with no travel history or contacts with any identified case. He added, however, that health workers are working round the clock to unravel how they contracted the disease.

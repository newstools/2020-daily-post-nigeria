The number of confirmed Coronavirus cases in the United States surpassed one million on Tuesday. CNN reports that infections across the US increased by more than 27,000, bringing the total number of cases to just over one million. According to a tally from John Hopkins University, there are at least 1,012,000 cases of the virus across the US, with 58,356 deaths. The new figures also showed that about 140,138 people have recovered from Coronavirus. It’s been reported that New York City remains the epicenter of the US outbreak, with over 160, 000 cases of Coronavirus and 12, 509 deaths. However, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention said that the milestone came at a time when seven coronavirus models anticipate a rise in coronavirus cases which will depend on how much “contact reduction” Americans practice. “State-level forecasts vary widely, reflecting differences in early epidemic phases, timing of interventions, and model-specific assumptions. ”Models that factor in strong contact reduction suggest deaths will continue to occur, but will “slow substantially over the next four weeks. “Conversely, models that do not incorporate strong contact reductions suggest that total deaths may continue to rise quickly,” the CDC said. Recall that the US President,Donald Trump, said he has instructed his administration to halt funding to the World Health Organization (WHO). According to the President, the WHO had “failed in its basic duty” in its response to the coronavirus outbreak.

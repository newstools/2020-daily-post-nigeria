The Yobe State COVID-19 Committee on Prevention and Control has announced the setting up of mobile courts to prosecute offenders of border closure directive. This was among seven points resolutions reached at the end of the Committee’s 5th meeting held on Tuesday in Damaturu. Commissioner for Home Affairs, Information and Culture, Abdullahi Bego, while briefing newsmen on the outcome of the meeting, said the committee also urged security operatives to conduct stop-and-search operations in major motor parks to ensure passengers are accounted for. “The committee is to liaise with hotel owners to ensure that all guests are accounted for and that no guest from areas with confirmed COVID-19 outbreaks stays without authorization. “Border communities are called upon to participate actively in the enforcement of border closure and to report any breaches to authorities in the community. “The committee advises people across the state to use facemasks whenever they are in public places,” Bego said. According to the commissioner, the COVID-19 Committee also warned trailer drivers to desist from carrying any passenger other than the three persons authorized to be on board as earlier announced. “The committee strongly reminds people across the state that COVID-19 is a highly contagious and easily transmittable disease. Therefore, social distancing, regular washing of hands and good respiratory etiquette as well as staying at home most of the time are the best ways to prevent transmission of the disease,” Bego added.

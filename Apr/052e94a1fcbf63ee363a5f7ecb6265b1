Former Chelsea and England goalkeeper, Peter Bonetti, is dead. Bonetti died at the age of 78 after suffering from a protracted illness. Chelsea announced his death in a statement on their official website on Sunday. “Peter Bonetti’s position in the pantheon of Chelsea footballing gods is unassailable,” a club statement read. “Bonetti was the Cat who broke the mould, defied the odds, drew the gasps, earned the cheers, and got the cream. All in front of an adoring Stamford Bridge. “Everyone at Chelsea wishes to send our heartfelt and deepest condolences to Peter’s family and friends.” Bonetti, who featured 729 times for Chelsea, was part of England’s 1966 World Cup-winning squad but was unused throughout the tournament. He also made seven England appearances and featured in the 1970 World Cup quarter-final defeat against West Germany.

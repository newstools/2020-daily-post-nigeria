The president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has said it will be an unforgivable sin, if the national team does not qualify for the World Cup. The next edition is scheduled to take place in Qatar in 2022. Speaking on Channels TV, Pinnick called on stakeholders to support the federation, in ensuring that the Super Eagles qualify. “It is a sin you cannot forgive. It is like the Holy Spirit. When you sin against the Holy Spirit, you know that you are going to hell fire. “So, if you don’t qualify for the world cup, you know what it means to Nigeria. A lot of things are going on and we don’t want to get distracted, irrespective of anything. “Because this year and next year is going to be a tough call for Nigeria Football. We need to qualify for the World Cup,” he said. Nigeria are in Group C in the African zone of the 2022 World Cup qualifiers. Gernot Rohr’s men must see off Liberia, Cape Verde and Central Africa Republic (CAR). The winners from the 10 groups will be drawn into five home-and-away ties, to decide the five nations that will fly the continent’s flag.

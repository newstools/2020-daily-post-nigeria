In a bid to contain the spread of COVID-19, Borno State government has ordered a total lockdown and shut its borders against non-essential movements. Alhaji Umar Kadafur, the Deputy Governor of Borno, who disclosed this in a statement on Sunday, said that the order would take effect from Monday, April 13, by 6 a.m, adding that movement in and out of the state would be completely restricted. Kadafur said, “The border between Borno and Yobe States would be shut down completely, only persons on essential duties and vehicles conveying food items, petrol, drugs and other essential commodities would be allowed into the state. “This painstaking decision became imperative as part of the measures to prevent spread of the virus into our dear state, following discoveries of some suspected cases in some northern states,” Kadafur said. Kadafur further warned people of the State to comply, pending further directives.
He said the State government regretted any inconvenience the decision would cause the general public. Meanwhile, Nigeria on Sunday recorded five new cases of Coronavirus in Nigeria. This now brings the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria to 323.

Given the community spread of COVID-19 across the country, the Federal Medical Centre, Lokoja has ordered that all patients or visitors entering the hospital must put on face mask before they would be attended to in the hospital. The directive, according to the hospital management in a statement on Monday, will take effect from Wednesday, 22nd April, 2020. The statement reads in part, ” We are already into community spread phase (Person To Person) of COVID-19, and there could be Asymptomatic Carriers who can potentially infect others. “The hospital management has decided that all persons coming into the hospital for whatsoever reason (Patients Inclusive) must wear at least fabric (Cloth Made) face mask to cover their mouth and nose before they can access any of our services. “To this effect, our staff reserves the right to deny you services without you wearing a face mask with effect from 22nd April, 2020. This is for personal and community protection, please. “Only one caregiver per patient who wears an authorized pass will be allowed within the hospital premises. Please comply with this directive so as to keep our staff and community safe from COVID-19”. DAILY POST reports that Kogi State is yet to report any index case of COVID-19.

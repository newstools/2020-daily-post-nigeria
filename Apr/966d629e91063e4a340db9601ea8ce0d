An Ibadan Chief, Adegboyega Taofeek Adegoke, on Tuesday declared that the only way to ensure that the stay-at-home order aims at curtailing the spread of Coronavirus is obeyed, is to provide palliatives for the citizens, especially the poor masses. Adegoke, who is the Ajia Balogun Olubadan of Ibadanland, noted that the inability of the federal and state governments to provide palliatives in forms of food and cash to the citizens, especially the needy is the reason many daily workers are not obeying the stay-at-home order. He made this known when he commenced the distribution of financial assistance to one hundred and twenty widows (120) in six local government areas of Ibadan. Adegoke, who doubled as the Executive Director, OES, Energy Services Limited, said that people would be ready to stay at home only if they are given what will sustain them to stay at home. “The only way to ensure that people stay at home is to provide palliatives for them. To ensure that this Coronavirus does not spread among our people, we have to ensure that we give them what they will use to stay at home. “The people who are hungry cannot stay at home. That is why it is difficult to enforce the stay at home order. If the government fails to give palliative to the people, they will not stay at home. But, if they are given what they will use to stay at home, they will comply. “We need to stop the spread of Coronavirus; that is why it is compulsory to give palliatives to the people before we can prevent them from going out.

The Civil Society-Scaling Up Nutrition in Nigeria(CS-SUNN), has called on the Presidential Task Force,(PTF) on COVID-19 to employ a multi-stakeholder and sectoral approach in combating the pandemic with focus on improving the nutrition status of Nigerians especially, the vulnerable. CS-SUNN in a press statement signed by the Executive Secretary, Beatrice Eluaka and sent to the DAILY POST said protecting the poor and the most vulnerable from hunger and malnutrition will be necessary for the success of COVID-19 response. The statement advised that in the rush to stall the spread of coronavirus, the Federal Government should also consider the disastrous increase in malnutrition in both the immediate and long term. ” Communities, vulnerable groups especially, women dealing with malnutrition and children suffering severe Acute Malnutrition, are more likely to be affected because of the pandemic. Since malnutrition weakens the immune system, these populations are susceptible to contracting COVID-19.” The Executive Secretary explained the need to implement social protection measures for the poor and most marginalized including refugees and Internally Displaced Persons ( IDPs) ” The poor and most marginalized are more vulnerable to CPVID-19 and must be supported to protect themselves from the virus and to stay resilient throughout the crisis and after.” The statement called on Nigerians to continue to consume adequate diets to boost their immunity to support recovery of those infected by the coronavirus. Eluaka then commended the efforts of the National Center for Disease Control, NCDC, Presidential Task Force on Covid-19, Federal Ministry of Health and all other relevant bodies and agencies in tackling the menace.

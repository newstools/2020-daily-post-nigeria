It also urged the general public to be wary of fake charities springing up purporting to offer guidelines on donations to government and ordinary Nigerians in a bid to cope with the discomfort arising out of COVID-19. DAILY POST learnt that the Acting Executive Chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, who disclosed the latest development, added that there was need for patriotic Nigerians to be cautious of fake Covid-19 ” Do-it-yourself” tests and shun any fraudulent charities offering guidelines on donations to the public. EFCC acting spokesman, Tony Orilade, said this in a statement to newsmen in Abuja.

He added, “The Federal Government has rolled out account details of accredited banks through which donations can be made. Please note that any other guideline for donations is fraudulent and should be ignored. “Besides, members of the public should be cautious of online investment involving various money-doubling schemes. We are tracking all those fraudulent operators and we wish to assure Nigerians that we will bring them and their sponsors to book”.

Hakim Ziyech has blasted those who feel AZ Alkmaar would have deserved the Eredivisie title more than Ajax, after the Dutch Football Federation (KNVB) decided to cancel the season without naming champions or relegating teams. The KNVB on Friday, announced that the 2019/2020 campaign was void, with Ziyech’s Ajax side at the top of the table ahead of AZ only on goal difference. AZ have beaten Ajax twice in the league this season, but some feel Alkmaar would have been worthy champions. “Come on, what nonsense I have heard? “We are at the top anyway. All those stories that AZ deserved more because they defeated us twice. So the goal difference, as it always is, doesn’t count now? “Bullsh*t of course. How did PSV become champion in 2007? Exactly, on one goal. That we are not official champions, well. Of course, I would also have preferred to have won the title on the field, but if you have to choose one club as champion, that is Ajax to me,” Ziyech told AD. The end of the Eredivisie season also means Ziyech’s time in Holland is over, as he agreed to join Chelsea since February.

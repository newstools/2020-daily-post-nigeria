The Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) has debunked claims that the Federal Government was providing free electricity to Nigerians amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Managing Director of TCN, Mr Usman Mohammed, who made this known in an interview with NAN on Thursday, said the government does not own all sections in the power sector. “There is also the information that power is going to be free, that is going to affect us because some customers who get this information may not likely pay. The Federal Government cannot make power free because it does not own the power. “Apart from the transmission (TCN) which is just the transporter of electricity that belongs to the Federal Government, all the other chains are in private hands. “As at now that the Federal Government is providing subsidy, and that is not coming enough as we still have huge unpaid bills,” he said. Mohammed added that electricity supply services significantly improved in the first 14 days of the lockdown across Lagos, Ogun states and Abuja. According to him, all the country needed was to sustain electricity supply.

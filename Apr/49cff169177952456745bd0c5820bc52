The Ogun State Government, on Wednesday, confirmed that the three new cases of coronavirus recorded in the state were Nigerians who returned to the country from Togo. The Commissioner for Health in Ogun, Dr Tomi Coker, explained that the three new cases were among the eight returnees from Togo travelling to Sokoto and Plateau State. According to the bus conductor conveying 10 persons, were stopped at the border of Imeko-Afon. The commissioner said that three of them tested positive to the virus within 48 hours of testing while five tested negative, with two awaiting results of the test. “About 72-hours ago, we had eight returnees from Togo heading toward Sokoto and Jos. We housed them here with a driver and a bus conductor, making 10 of them. “We ran a test on them about 48 hours ago and out of the 10, we got eight results of which three were positive. “They are Nigerian citizens, returning back to the nation. They were met at the border of Imeko; we were notified of their return. ” They are Nigerians returning from Togo. The important thing is that these are reported cases and if we don’t deal with them now, we may have issues of community spreading,” she said. She, therefore, encouraged residents of the state to take advantage of the mobile testing across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state to know their status. “So, I must encourage everyone, we are out in the 20 Local Government Areas. Coker said testing in each ward is ongoing for the next 14 days, adding that the process is to avoid community spread. “When we do more tests, we are likely to have more results that are positive and the state is prepared. “We have also identified sites where we can scale up into if we come to a situation of exhausting our capacity of 300,” NAN quoted her as saying.

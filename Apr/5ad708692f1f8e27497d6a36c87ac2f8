Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, has kicked against the call for an Igbo Chief of Staff made by Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, OYC. National Leader of BNYL, Princewill Chimezie Richard described the Ohanaeze Youth body as a group of long throats who are no different from Almajiris. BNYL said that the office of the Chief of Staff is irrelevant to the Igbos. The OYC had yesterday while reacting to the death of Abba Kyari, the late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, demanded that the vacant office be filled by an Igbo man. But BNYL cautioned the youth President of Ohanaeze against misrepresenting the Igbo interest, stating that the people of the South East are not beggars. “Ordinarily I shouldn’t have responded, but it’s a shameful thing that some group who call themselves Ohanaeze Youths are misrepresenting the interest of the Igbos as they claim to be an apex umbrella body, but I see them as long throats, no difference between them and Almajiri.” He said the BNYL is not concerned about any appointment given to anybody from the Southeast and South-south because none of the offices are favoring the Biafra actualization.

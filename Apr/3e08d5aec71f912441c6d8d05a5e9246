Coronavirus, the deadly virus ravaging the world, has affected a Tiger at Bronx Zoo in New York. A 4-year-old Malayan tiger at the zoo tested positive for the COVID-19. It is believed that this is the first tiger infected with Covid-19 in the US and anywhere in the World. There were earlier reports that dogs, pets and other animals are immune to the deadly virus. The announcement was made by the federal officials and the zoo after a test was conducted in Iowa by the USDA’s National Veterinary Services Laboratory. The tiger was reported to have been infected after exposure to a zoo worker who wasn’t yet showing symptoms, the zoo said. “Appropriate preventative measures have been implemented to care for the cats and minimize further exposure. “According to the Wildlife Conservation Society, six other large cats and three African lions are also showing Coronavirus symptoms, but they are all expected to recover. “Though they have experienced some decrease in appetite, the cats at the Bronx Zoo are otherwise doing well under veterinary care and are bright, alert, and interactive with their keepers,” the zoo’s release read.

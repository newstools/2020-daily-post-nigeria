The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday assured Nigerians that hoodlums using Coronavirus lockdown will face the music. Lanre Issa-Onilu, National Publicity Secretary, in a statement, assured that the federal government would ensure the safety of lives and property as well as speedy provision of palliatives to citizens. He said that in line with the directives of President Muhammadu Buhari during his broadcast on Monday, a major and coordinated offensive by the Police, Army, Navy, Air force and Directorate of State Services (DSS) was underway against the miscreants. “There is no dispute about the hardships being faced by many citizens as a result of the unavoidable lockdown. However, we must resist criminal elements trying to exploit the situation and in the process inflicting further hardships on already stressed fellow Nigerians. “In responding to this ugly situation, we would like to caution the various vigilante groups to resist the urge to resort to unlawful and extra-judicial actions in the name of protecting communities. “There are already disturbing reports of vigilantes terrorizing innocent citizens. What we all need now is to offer ourselves support and ensure we provide as much comfort as possible for one another. “While the government and private concerns are doing their best to provide relief, we all have a responsibility to join our security services in protecting ourselves and communities from miscreants”, Issa-Onilu said. APC added that Nigeria is recording great success in tracking, testing suspected cases and generally containing further spread of the COVID-19. The spokesman expressed the party’s confidence that the fight against the global pandemic will be won soon and Nigerians would return to normal lives and activities.

France’s Ligue 1 has ended with immediate effect. This comes after the country’s Prime Minister, Edouard Philippe, made it clear there will be no professional football in the country until September at least, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Philippe spoke on Tuesday at the National Assembly, while unveiling France’s plans to exit social distancing. “The big sporting affairs cannot occur before September,” he said, according to Sky Sports. “The 2019-20 professional football season cannot return.” The decision means the 2019/2020 season in Ligue 1 and 2 will, therefore, end with immediate effect. Paris Saint-Germain are currently top of this year’s Ligue 1 table and were looking to be crowned champions for a third successive year. Marseille occupy the final Champions League spots alongside Rennes, while Lille are set to secure a place in the Europa League. The Professional Football League (LFP) and French Football Federation (FFF) will now decide how to determine promotion, relegation and European qualification.

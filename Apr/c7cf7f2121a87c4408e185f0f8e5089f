The Nigeria Center for Disease and Control, NCDC, has apologised for confirming a new case of Coronavirus in Ekiti State. DAILY POST reported that NCDC on Saturday confirmed one case in Ekiti, making it four cases in the State. However, NCDC in a post on its Twitter page on Sunday morning, said the report was an error from its verification process. The tweet read: “Yesterday, we erroneously reported one new case in Ekiti. This was wrong and was caused by an error in the verification process. “Therefore, as at April 18 2020, there are 541 confirmed cases, 166 discharged and 19 deaths. “Ekiti state has 3 confirmed cases, not 4.”

About ten suspected cultists were allegedly killed on Tuesday in Ugep, Yakurr local government area of Cross River during a renewed cult clash. Speaking with DAILY POST via phone on Tuesday, the Paramount Ruler of Yakurr local government area, His Royal Majesty (HRM), Obol Ofem Ubana Eteng said he was not in Ugep but explained that at the time he left, there was no problem in the community. He, however, confirmed that information reaching him alleged that a cult group known as Vikings, which split into two factions and called themselves Bakars clashed among themselves. “The same cult group, the Vikings, split into two, the junior Vikings which called themselves the Bakars fought themselves and they have been fighting since December 2019 killing people like that. “I cannot say the number of persons killed now but I am going home, when I get home, I will make enquiries and get the truth of the incident with a view to curbing it from escalating” he stated. Also speaking with our reporter via phone, the Permanent Secretary, Governor’s office, in charge of security, Dr. Alfred Mboto said he got distress calls from the Paramount Ruler of Yakurr that there was a renewed cult clash in his domain and that he was in Calabar. “We have informed the Commissioner of Police, CP Uche J. Anozia to send men there and quell the incident. The Paramount of Yakurr called me and informed me about the renewed cult clash and said some casualties have been recorded” Information gathered by DAILY POST revealed that about ten persons have been gunned down and one of the leaders of one of the factions has also been killed. When DAILY POST called on the Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Irene Ugbo, she declined the calls.

The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) Borno State office, says it closed an illegal facility engaged in the production of unregistered yogurt. The state’s Acting Coordinator of NAFDAC, Nasiru Mayo, made this known in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja. Mayo said shutting down of the manufacturing facility was done during the surveillance activities in the state in line with the statutory mandate of the agency. According to him, the product compromised all standards, in view of gross lapses with respect to Good Hygiene Practices (GHP) and Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) as well as not being registered with NAFDAC. He said ”The first line of sanction applied was to put the facility on hold, seizure and destruction of the product and summoning the owner for possible prosecution. ”Available information confirms that the owner took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic situation to produce and sell the unregistered product in the state. ”NAFDAC would not close its eyes and allow such regrettable violations to sabotage the effort of safeguarding the health of the public.” Mayo added that stiffer punishments awaited those who persisted on production of unregistered products. He said the agency would remain vigilant more than ever before, NAN reports.

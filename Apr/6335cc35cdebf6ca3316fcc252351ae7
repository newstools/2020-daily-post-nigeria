World heavyweight champion, Anthony Joshua, has revealed that he has “lost close ones” to coronavirus. Joshua disclosed this via a clip on his YouTube channel on Wednesday. “Wherever you are in the world I’m just checking in personally for everyone to just say, I hope you were well I will keep it safe. “I’ve lost no one immediate to me. But I’ve lost close ones from my boxing gym, close friends and friends of friends. And it gets serious when it starts coming closer to home,” the 30-year-old said. Joshua’s title defence against IBF mandatory challenger Kubrat Pulev scheduled for June, is set to be rescheduled due to the pandemic. “I would love to be out there right now doing the most on my dirt bikes, meeting up with my boys, sparring, going down to the boxing gym. Even a rebel like me is trying to follow some guidelines to do the right thing,” he added.

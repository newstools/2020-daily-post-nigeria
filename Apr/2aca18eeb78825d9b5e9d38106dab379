Arsenal has contacted four of their first-team players, David Luiz, Granit Xhaka, and Nicolas Pepe, after pictures and videos emerged of them breaking UK government-imposed COVID-19 lockdown rules, according to Sky Sports. Pepe was recorded playing football with friends in North London, Luiz and Xhaka met up at a park in Southgate, and Lacazette was photographed talking to a car valeter in his driveway. Recall that Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, some days ago apologized for overseeing a training session, amid the UK government-imposed lockdown during the Coronavirus pandemic. Mourinho was pictured at Hadley Common Park with midfielder, Tanguy Ndombele. Defenders Davinson Sanchez and Ryan Sessegnon were also filmed by passers-by running together through the park. Also, Manchester City defender, Kyle Walker, apologised for breaking COVID-19 lockdown rules by ‘hosting sex party’ in his apartment earlier this month. The Premier League is currently suspended indefinitely due to the spread of COVID-19 across the world.

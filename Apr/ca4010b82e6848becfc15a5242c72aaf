The Cross River State Government has commenced the enforcement of no-mask-movement policy. A statement signed by the Personal Assistant to the Commissioner for Health, Item Kris, said the state Garment Factory has heightened effort to ensure that they work round the clock to produce 1 million facemasks free of charge for Cross Riverians. He said the no-mask-no-movement policy has commenced, noting that the one million facemasks are expected to be worn by residents of the state Kris noted that failure to comply with these executive directives will lead to arrest and quarantine for a period of 14 days and will only be released when it’s ascertained that he/she is COVID-19 free. “This preventive measure is to ensure that the state remains free of the COVID-19. The facemasks are given at no cost in line with the governor’s orders. “Residents have, therefore, been advised by the Commissioner for Health, Dr Betta Edu, to always be on their facemasks wherever they are going, as she debunked speculations that WHO is insisting that only health workers at the front line of this fight should be on nose masks. ‘Facemasks prevent persons from spreading the virus to another whenever they talk, cough or sneeze. “By this, all Cross Riverians and residents are advised to use nose masks if they desire to go to anywhere or better still stay at home as this practice will help the state to continue to maintain the free status from the said virus after the results of the four suspected cases recently sent to Irua in Edo State came back negative, making Cross River State still free of COVID-19,” the statement added

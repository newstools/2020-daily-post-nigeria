A £12million private plane used by Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, was forced into an emergency landing at Brussels airport in Belgium on Friday morning. The plane was forced to land after it developed issues with its landing gear, according to Belgian outlet HLN. Messi was not on board at the time, but the aircraft touched down en route to Tenerife at 9.10 am. The plane was said to have taken off again 90 minutes later, before turning back and returning to the Belgian capital. However, Brussels airport has refused to comment on the incident due to GDPR legislation. Messi, who is widely considered one of the greatest players of all-time, has won six-time Ballon d’Or awards. The Argentine captain had scored 19 goals and provided 12 assists in 22 La Liga games for Barcelona so far this season before the Spanish top-flight league was suspended due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic across the globe.

Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has revealed the player he wants the club to sell this summer, instead of attacking midfielder, Philippe Coutinho. Coutinho is currently on loan at Bayern Munich, but the Bundesliga club will not exercise their purchase option to sign him permanently. The 27-year-old, who had previously played for Liverpool in England, is eyeing a return to the Premier League, and Chelsea is already in talks with his agent over a summer move. According to The Athletic, Messi and a few senior players at Barcelona would rather want the Camp Nou club to sell forward, Ousmane Dembele, and keep hold of Coutinho. The report added that Messi and other senior Barca players are aware that someone will need to be sold if the La Liga champions have any chance of finding the money to re-sign forward, Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain. Coutinho has not really impressed at Barcelona since his Â£142million move from Liverpool in 2018.

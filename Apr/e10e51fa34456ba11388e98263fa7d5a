The Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole (OPLD) and Artillery Batteries of Sector 3, Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) have destroyed an Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) camp at Tumbun Fulani on the fringes of Lake Chad in Northern Borno State. This was disclosed in a statement on Saturday by Acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko. According to him, this was achieved through combined air and artillery bombardments conducted on April 3rd. Onyeuko added that it was in furtherance of the coordinated joint offensive by the MNJTF to dislodge and completely rid the Tumbuns Islands of terrorists’ presence and activities. “The operation was executed on the heels of credible intelligence reports indicating that the ISWAP elements, and their structures concealed under the dense vegetation of the area, used the settlement as a base where they plan and launch attacks. “Accordingly, the joint interdiction mission was launched with a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) aircraft coordinating the barrage of artillery and air fire towards designated targets in the settlement, destroying them and neutralising some of the ISWAP fighters in the process,” NAN quoted him as saying.

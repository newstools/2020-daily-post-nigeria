Following the incessant killings and harassment of indigenes and residents of Orhionmwon Local Government Area of Edo State by some alleged Fulani herdsmen, the council chairman, Hon. Sylvester Okoro, has ordered herders to vacate the area within the next fourteen days. Hon. Okoro gave the directive in Ugo community, during an emergency security meeting called to address the recent kidnappings, killings and destruction of farm produce in the area. According to the statement from Chief Press Secretary to the council, Mr Roy Osariemen, the fourteen-day ultimatum is coming on the heels of the recent attack on the indigenes of the area. ‘’Orhiomwon is a pure agrarian area, since we can’t identify those perpetuating the evil activities. After the evacuation, we will carry out proper documentation of those who wish to graze in our land.” “I can no longer stomach the atrocities and satanic activities of these murderers and thieves. We have been living together for many years peacefully, since they have decided to turn our hospitable act to weakness, they should look for somewhere else to rare their animals.” Mr. Nosa Obamwonyi and Mr. Mike Eghaghe, who spoke on behalf of the affected indigenes, applauded the decision of the LGA boss. ‘We appreciate our council chairman’s efforts, so far in making sure issues between the herdsmen and their host communities are settled amicably, but all to no avail due to their hidden agenda to continue their atrocities in our land. “We are very pleased with today’s decision, he had on several occasions tried to settle this matter but these Fulani people still kept perpetuating their evils. We can now sleep with our two eyes closed, our mothers and sisters can now go to the farm without fear of being raped, our farm produce will no longer be used to feed cows.” Those present at the meeting were, security heads in charge of the local government, local vigilantes, community heads (Enigies) youths and elders of affected communities.

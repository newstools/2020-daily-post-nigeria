Six Barcelona board members have resigned from their respective positions. They informed club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu of their decision via a strongly-worded letter. They are: Vice Presidents; Emili Rousand and Enrique Tombas; Directors – Silvio Elias, Maria Teixidor, Josep Pont and Jordi Clasamiglia. The group questioned the club’s leadership and asked for it to be reviewed as soon as possible. “We hereby want to communicate that the undersigned managers have transferred to President Bartomeu; our decision to irrevocably resign from our position as managers of FC Barcelona,” part of the group’s letter read via La Vanguardia. “We have reached this point by not being able to reverse the criteria and forms of management of the club in the face of the important challenges of the future and, especially, from the new post-pandemic scenario.” Bartomeu, who has been in charge since 2015, has come under fire lately for how he is handling the club. Barca have already announced 70% pay cuts for their players amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

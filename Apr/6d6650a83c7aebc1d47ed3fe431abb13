President Muhammadu Buhari, Monday night, announced that the lockdown ease he approved will take effect from Monday, May 4. The implicit meaning of this is that the president has extended the ‘stay at home’ directive by seven days – tonight till May 3. Thus, the lockdown in Lagos and Ogun States as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja remains. Buhari said recommendations of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 were carefully studied. The president said he also took into consideration the position of the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) on ease of the lockdown. However, the Nigerian leader’s ban on interstate movement confirms DAILY POST report on Sunday. “There will be a ban on non-essential inter-state passenger travels until further notice. There will be partial and controlled interstate movement of goods and services will be allowed from producers to consumer”, he said. The Chief Press Secretary to a state governor had told our correspondent that the chief executives made their position known on Friday to enable the federal government to put in place necessary arrangements for compliance. “The governors’ resolution is to curtail the spread of coronavirus. The federal government has the power to shut inter-state borders, hence the request to Mr. President. It’s a done deal,” the source declared.

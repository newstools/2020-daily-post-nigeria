The Directorate of State Service (DSS) has refuted claims that it arrested anyone associated with Chief Taiwo Akerele, a former Chief of Staff (CoS) to Gov. Godwin Obaseki of Edo State. Reports emerged on Sunday that DSS allegedly stormed the residence of Chief Taiwo Akerele, a former Chief of Staff to the governor who resigned on Saturday. There were also reports that the operatives arrested one Jaspa Olowojoba, a Personal Assistant to Akerele, when the operative could not find him. But, speaking on Monday, Mr Sheikh Waziri, DSS Director in Edo, maintained that no operative of the service invaded the residence of Akerele on Sunday. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that, “I have verified and confirmed that the DSS Edo State has not invaded the residence nor arrested anyone associated with the former CoS.” Meanwhile, Mr Osaze Uzamure has taken over as the new Chief of Staff.

His tweet read: “The video of an NCDC official dumping his PPE is misleading. True, some officials removed their PPEs at the cemetery, but a dedicated staff went around, picked all and put them in a casket and then used a chemical to burn them. “They also disinfected the environment, immediately.” Dear @NCDCgov video is reported to be from today's burial of Late Abba Kyari who sadly passed, man filmed dumping protective clothes that could have been #Covid_19 contaminated in a public area, could bepicked up by a anyone.

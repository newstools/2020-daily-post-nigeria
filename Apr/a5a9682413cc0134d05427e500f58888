The Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, has admitted the country has not gotten to its peak yet, despite the increasing number of confirmed Coronavirus (COVID-19) cases in the country. Ihekweazu, while speaking on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily on Friday, said Nigeria still has “a number of weeks” to go. He said: “From our projection, we are not near the peak yet; we still have a number of weeks to go. “But we are trying to stretch out these weeks even further so we can push the peak a bit further out but make sure that the peak is not as steep as it would otherwise have been if no measures were put in place,” Ihekweazu said. There are currently 981 confirmed cases in Nigeria, with the 1,000 mark expected to be crossed by Saturday morning. 197 patients have been discharged, while 31 deaths have been recorded.

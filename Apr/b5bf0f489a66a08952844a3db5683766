A statement signed by APC’s National Publicity Secretary, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, claimed that Oshiomhole’s action had ensured a smooth working relationship between the executive and legislature. APC commended Oshiomhole for “working assiduously” towards ensuring that the party renewed its presidential mandate in 2019. The party commended Oshiomhole for his doggedness, steadfastness and pro-masses disposition. According to the statement: “On this special day, we salute our Comrade Chairman, who in his entire public service to this great country, has demonstrated doggedness, steadfastness and pro-masses disposition in his actions and utterances. “The party acknowledges with pride the energy and commitment with which Comrade Oshiomhole has been propagating the mantra of “One Man, One Vote”, even before joining party politics.” APC stated that its National Chairman was doing all within his power to strengthen democracy and participatory politics in Nigeria. “And in his current assignment as the National Chairman of our great party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, aside from working assiduously with other party members to ensure the renewal of our presidential mandate in the 2019 elections, is doing all it takes to strengthen democratic structures and participatory politics with utmost fidelity to the best practices and our party’s constitution.

The government of President Muhammadu Buhari has come under heavy criticism for allegedly sending “rotten mouldy rice” to the South West as part of its palliative measures for the people of the region. Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, condemned the gesture by the Federal Government, adding that the other governors in the region also returned the rice while commended Seyi Makinde, of Oyo State for being bold enough to make the matter public. Recall that the Oyo State Government on Friday, said it would return bags of rice received from the Federal Government, after discovering it is in bad condition. Three trailer loads of rice containing about 1,800 bags, were sent to the State by the Federal Government. But they are now said to be infested with weevil and unfit for human consumption. The Oyo Government, however, said it would be expecting another round of replacement for the bad rice. “Disgusted that the FG could send rotten mouldy rice to South West as part of their so-called palliatives. Did they do the same to northern states? “I gather ALL the South West Governors sent the rice back but only @seyiamakinde was bold enough to let the world know what happened. I commend him.” (sic).

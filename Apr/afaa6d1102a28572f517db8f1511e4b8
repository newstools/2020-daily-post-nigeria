President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the latest attacks by bandits in Katsina State in three local government areas that left 47 persons dead. Reacting to the incident in a statement signed by his media aide, Garba Shehu and made available to DAILY POST on Sunday, the President said that he was deeply saddened by the latest development. He called on Nigerians not to despair because this administration was ever determined to defeat and crush these criminal elements taking advantage of the lockdown to attack their victims. President Buhari said he will not tolerate this large scale killing of innocent people by the bandits, adding that “in line with my commitment to security of the people, these attacks will be met with decisive force.” The President directed the security agencies not to rest on their oars or lower their guard which will create a vacuum for the bandits to strike. While extending his sympathies to the families of the victims, he called on the people to show more vigilance by reporting the activities of criminal elements in their midst.

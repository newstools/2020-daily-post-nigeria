The Katsina State Government has lifted suspension on Friday congregational prayers earlier stopped due to COVID-19. This was announced in a statement on Tuesday night by the Secretary to the State Government, Mustapha Inuwa. He said the decision was an outcome of a meeting between the government, religious leaders, traditional rulers and security agents. Inuwa explained that they reviewed some measures taken by the government to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the state. “The Executive Governor has directed that the suspension of Friday prayers be lifted with immediate effect; however, the prayers will be conducted under some stipulated health and security guidelines. “The Jumu’at Imams should, however, avoid prolonged sermons in order to discharge their followers within the shortest period”, Inuwa noted. The SSG advised people to strongly maintain social distancing and adhere strictly to all the rules provided by health experts. The suspension was lifted despite the fact that coronavirus killed a Daura-based private Medical practitioner, Dr. Aminu Yakubu.

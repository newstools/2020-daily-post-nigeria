Cheques going out to U.S. taxpayers as part of a stimulus programme, to help workers suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, will have President Donald Trump’s name on them. The President during a briefing at the Rose Garden, outside the White House, said he was sure that people would be very happy to get a big, fat, beautiful cheque with his name on it. The cheques are a one-time payout of up to 1,200 dollars per adult, and 500 dollars per child, with a cap for high income earners. People who had their bank accounts on record with the federal government for tax payments already began to receive direct deposits. Trump’s name is expected to appear not as the legal signature on the physical cheques, but in a separate area. NAN reports that similar cheques, such as tax refunds, go out through the Internal Revenue Service, which sits under the Treasury Department, and the signature is of the office holder of that section of government.

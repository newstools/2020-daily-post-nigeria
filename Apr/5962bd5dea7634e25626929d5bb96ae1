The Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma, has been urged to constitute the Interim Management Committees for the 27 LGAs in the state without delay. This followed a motion moved by the member representing Aboh-mbaise state constituency in Imo House of Assembly, Eddy Obinna Tuesday during plenary. The lawmaker, while leading debate, noted that the introduction of the IMCs at the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic will go a long way in extending awareness to the rural areas of the state. Although, he said the Governor has so far shown readiness to conduct local government council election, he advised it was necessary an interim management be set up pending the conduct of the council election. The lawmaker further expressed fear at the spate of the viral disease, stressing the need for stronger enlightenment campaigns across rural communities. DAILY POST reports that the motion was seconded by Samuel Otuibe of Ahiazu-mbaise state constituency and was adopted by the House after massive support from members.

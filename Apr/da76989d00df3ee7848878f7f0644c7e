Former presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party, YPP, Kingsley Moghalu has warned Governor Umar Ganduje-led government against covering up the mysterious deaths in the state. There have been serious concerns over the recent deaths which claimed the lives of prominent Nigerians in the state. Moghalu took to his Twitter page describing the response from the government on the development as ‘political’. He warned that if the spread of COVID-19 becomes uncontrolled in Kano, Nigeria will feel the heat in general, hence no need for cover-ups. Moghalu wrote: “What’s happening in Kano? We need clear answers to the sudden and rapid spike in deaths of the elderly. Is it Covid-19 ? “It’s unfortunate that the response appears politicized. “There is no need for cover-ups. We all lose. If Covid-19 becomes uncontrolled in Kano @NCDCgov.” DAILY POST recalls that Femi Falana, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, while speaking on the development, issued the state government a seven-day ultimatum to provide a detailed report on the mysterious death in the state. However, the Kano Commissioner of Information, Muhammad Garba, in a statement on Sunday, disclosed that most of the deaths in the state were caused by complications arising from hypertension, diabetes, meningitis and acute malaria. He noted that Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje was waiting for the final report from the state Ministry of Health, before taking further actions. Garba assured residents and Nigerians to remain calm as the government was working towards keeping residents safe.

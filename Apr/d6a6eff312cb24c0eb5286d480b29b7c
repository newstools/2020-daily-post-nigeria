The Union of European Football Association (UEFA) has reportedly devised a new plan where they could finish the 2019/20 Champions League and Europa League competitions within three weeks in August. DAILY POST recalls that UEFA suspended the Champions League, Europa League, and the European Championship play-offs indefinitely due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world.  UEFA President, Aleksander Ceferin, has since admitted that the remaining Champions League and Europa League games could resume behind closed doors but also ruled out the possibility of both competitions being played into September this year. According to The Mirror, UEFA is hoping to resume the European football season in August, but that would depend on whether the teams still playing in the competition will finish their respective league seasons by then. Presently, there is no football competition being played in Europe except for the Belarus league. The German Bundesliga has planned to resume their domestic league by early May with the view to finishing their fixtures by July. No other European leagues has considered the same. However, UEFA is anticipating that the Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, French Ligue 1, and others will restart their domestic seasons by mid-June and complete their games over six weeks.

The Nigeria Medical Association, NMA, Kwara state chapter has waded into the alleged misconduct of Professor Alakija Salami in the management of a suspected deceased COVID-19 patient who died under his care at the University of Ilorin teaching hospital recently. In a chat with newsmen in Ilorin on Tuesday, the state NMA Chairman, Dr Muhammed Kolade Solagberu, disclosed that the medical ethics committee of the association headed by Professor Boduwoye is currently investigating the matter to ascertain what transpired. DAILY POST, however, learned that all the doctors who had contacts with the embattled Dr Salami in the management of the deceased were currently on self-quarantine,” hence “it is difficult to get any information from them as the investigation intensifies.” Dr Solagberu further said, ” it is not the best for us to call them on the phone to know what transpired in the course of management of the deceased patient.” “Until the ethics committee completes its investigation and submits its report, we will know the next line of action as we can’t rely on social media information,” he added. DAILY POST recalls that Professor Salami, a consultant with the University of Ilorin teaching hospital, was suspended by the authorities following his alleged misconduct in the management and eventual death of a suspected COVID-19 patient under secrecy.

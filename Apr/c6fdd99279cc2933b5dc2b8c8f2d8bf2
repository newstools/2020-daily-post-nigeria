Spanish football expert, Guillem Balague, has claimed that Real Madrid wants to ‘offload’ four of their players, Luka Modric, James Rodriguez, Gareth Bale, and Lucas Vazquez, this summer transfer window. Balague also said that Zinedine Zidane’s side is not planning to sign any player this summer. Real Madrid has been linked with a summer move for Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, Liverpool’s Sadio Mane, and Paris Saint-Germain stars, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe. But Balague believes the Los Blancos have no specific targets heading into the next window but wants to sell Modric, Rodriguez, Bale and Vazquez first. “I know that Neymar has been related to Real Madrid by his former agent, Wagner Ribeiro, who has said Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez still dreams of taking him to Real Madrid,” Balague said on his YouTube channel. “But Real Madrid are not planning to sign any player at this stage. “Real Madrid wants to think about the loan deals that they have got out there, like Achraf Hakimi, Martin Odegaard, and see if they bring the players back to Santiago Bernabeu. “But first, Real Madrid want to see if they can get rid of the likes of Modric, Lucas Vazquez, James, Bale.”

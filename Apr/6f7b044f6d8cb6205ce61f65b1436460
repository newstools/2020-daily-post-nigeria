Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, on Sunday, revealed that the state has not tested anyone for Coronavirus. Speaking on Channels TV on Sunday, Bello said this was because it developed an application for tracking symptoms and no one has so far manifested signs in the state. Bello boasted that its COVID-19 sensitization campaign was yielding good results. He said, “So far, so good, we have launched an app, and if nobody shows any sign or symptoms, we will not go out and catch anyone because we want to test anybody. “We do not have any testing centre in Kogi but is in FCT, and we have test kits in case there is any need to collect samples. “But if no one comes out with any issue or reported case, what are we going to collect to send to any of the testing centres? “ I think our sensitization program is working excellently well, and our people are following our instruction. When asked why Kogi State is yet to order total lockdown even as neighbouring states recorded so many cases of COVID-19 recently, he said, “FCT is not the only state close to us. We have ten borders, and we have technically shut down and enlightened our people. By technically shutting down, we are not locked up.” Kogi State has not recorded any case of Coronavirus.

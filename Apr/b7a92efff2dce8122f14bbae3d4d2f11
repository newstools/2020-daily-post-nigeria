Serie A’s suspension has been extended to May 3. This is in line with the Italian government’s latest lockdown measures, to contain the coronavirus outbreak. All sporting activities in Italy had been put on hold initially until April 13, with the country having been on a national lockdown since March 10. Serie A was the first major league in Europe to suspend games, when four matches due to be played on the weekend of February 22 and 23 were called off. Players and managers will take a salary cut of one third should the season not be played out. The cut will be one sixth, if it is finished conclusively, in order to help with the financial burden of football not being played. The last Serie A match was between Sassuolo and Brescia on March 9.

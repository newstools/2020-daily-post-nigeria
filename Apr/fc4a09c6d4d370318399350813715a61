Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan on New Media, has questioned the whereabouts of President Muhammadu Buhari and his Vice, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo. Majority of Nigerians believe that their leaders have been missing in action while other countries’ Presidents go about giving daily updates to their citizens on the novel Coronavirus pandemic. 73-year-old Donald Trump, his vice, Mike Pence, (60) and top members of the US government have headed the country’s task force on COVID-19, providing daily information to citizens and making scientific suggestions to their scientists. Here in Africa, Presidents of South Africa, Ghana, and other countries have been seen actively addressing and consoling their people in this traumatic period. Reno Omokri wonders where Nigerian leaders have been, describing them as the crisis “we face.” Ever since the dreaded disease made its way to Nigeria through an Italian on February 27, 2020, President Buhari has only address Nigerians twice in nationwide broadcasts many believed were recorded and aired via Nigeria Television Authority, NTA. “Where are General @MBuhari and Pastor @ProfOsinbajo?,” the former presidential aide asked in a tweet on Saturday night. “The more you look for them, the less you see of them. “It is as if Nigeria has a government in absentia. Leaders should be more visible in a crisis. In our own case, our leaders are the crisis we face!”

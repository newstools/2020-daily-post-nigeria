The Northern Governors Forum (NGF) is set to repatriate Almajiris (beggars) to their states of origin. The measure is meant to contain the spread of coronavirus in the Northern region. Yahaya Sarki, the Special Adviser to Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State on Media disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday. He said the governor made the announcement while interacting with the State Task Force on COVID-19 at the Kebbi Medical Centre in Kalgo. The governor said the resolutions were reached at the meeting of the NGF in Kaduna on Tuesday. Bagudu noted that all the northern states had been mandated to effect the agreement. He explained that some of the Almajiri children from Kebbi had since been returned to Kebbi from Kaduna State. Bagudu said: “Some states have already started implementing this decision by taking back such Almajiri children to their states. I do believe that all the states in the region will soon commence the repatriation and this is for the common good of the states and Nigeria.”

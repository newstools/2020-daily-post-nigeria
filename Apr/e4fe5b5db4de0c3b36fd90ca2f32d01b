The Commissioner of Police, FCT Command, Bala Ciroma, has ordered an investigation into an allegation trending on the social media that COVID-19 exemption tags are being sold to persons not on the exemption list. This was contained in a statement Wednesday night by DSP Anjuguri Manzah, Public Relations Officer of the command. He stated that the tags, which are only issued by the Police and the FCTA Security Service Department, were part of measures adopted to check the flagrant violation of the presidential lockdown order. “Similarly, the authentic COVID-19 exemption tags are issued only to duly verified persons that are essential service providers. The exemption tags are free of charge.” The spokesman assured Nigerians that unscrupulous elements printing and sharing these tags will be fished out soon. The presidential lockdown is also in effect in Lagos.

The Oyo State Road Transport Management Authority (OYRTMA) on Thursday said it has impounded no fewer than 36 commercial trailers and other articulated vehicles for disobeying government orders. OYRTMA noted that the vehicles were seized during their routine operations and surveillance in the State. DAILY POST gathered that the State Governor, Mr. Seyi Makinde had earlier ordered a 7pm-6am curfew in the state, as part of efforts to reduce the spread of the Coronavirus also known as COVID-19. OYRTMA’s Executive Chairman, Akin Fagbemi revealed that the 36 vehicles were impounded between Wednesday 1st of April, 2020 and Wednesday 8th of April, 2020 for violating the restriction of movement orders in the state. “They used their trucks to convey multitude of persons as against the approved carriage of food items, pharmaceutical products and other essential goods/services. “Some articulated trucks and trailers numbering about 36 were impounded in Oyo State between Wednesday, 1st of April, 2020 and Wednesday 8th of April, 2020 for violating the restriction of movement orders of the State Government, having previously established that the virus is majorly transmitted through human movements from one place to another. “These articulated vehicles were seen conveying hundreds of persons as against the approved food items, pharmaceuticals and other essentials without any official permit or convincing reasons. “These acts negate efforts by the Oyo State Government to mitigate the spread of the novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) through inter and intra State vehicular movements and influx of foreign persons into the State. Fagbemi warned companies, drivers of articulated trucks, who engage in such act, adding that any vehicle impounded shall be made to face the full wrath of the extant laws of the State.

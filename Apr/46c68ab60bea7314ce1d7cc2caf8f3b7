Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere, on Tuesday, lamented that the lockdown has not been effective in tackling the spread of COVID-19. Afenifere’s spokesperson, Yinka Odumakin, said the situation with regard to COVID-19 spread was getting more terrible in Nigeria despite the lockdown. Odumakin spoke while reacting to the nationwide address by President Muhammadu Buhari. Recall that Buhari had ordered the extension of the lockdown by nearly one week while reeling out other directives. However, Odumakin, while speaking with DAILY POST lamented that the government was not doing enough in the fight against the virus. According to Odumakin: “Even world leaders have no answers to the questions Coronavirus has posed not to talk of our clueless president in Nigeria. “Recently, the FG had said 90 percent of the people who recovered from the virus were not given any treatment. Let me state that they are not doing anything. “They are just keeping people at home perhaps to lower the spread, but despite the lockdown, things are getting worse. “When the lockdown was implemented, we had only 112 cases with about 4 cases per day, but today we have over 1,000 with over 40 cases daily.” Buhari had during his nationwide broadcast on Monday extended the lockdown by one week. When asked to react to the lockdown extension, Odumakin said the federal government was currently in an impasse. “They are in a fix, globally, there is no vaccine or cure, our government is just pretending to be seen as doing something,” he added.

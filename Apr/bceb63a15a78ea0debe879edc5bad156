The Premier League’s hope to restart the 2019/2020 season has suffered a big blow, as a growing number of players do not want to play football during the coronavirus crisis, ESPN reports. The English top-flight has been suspended since March 13 because of the pandemic. However, there have been discussions among stakeholders, to ensure the campaign is completed and not called off. But the players have reservations about playing through the Coronavirus outbreak. “A lot of players are very uncomfortable with coming back. “The only way the league takes this seriously is when someone at a club dies. We will look back on this time with sadness in the future,” a source said. Top-flight clubs will again meet on Friday, to discuss options available for resumption amid growing opposition to playing, even behind closed doors by players. The UK’s Culture Secretary, Oliver Dowden, has said he has been in contact with clubs about restarting the Premier League “as soon as possible,” and UEFA has told leagues to outline their plans for resuming by May 25.

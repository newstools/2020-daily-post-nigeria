Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has reacted to the lock down in a bid to tackle the spread of Coronavirus. Kanu lamented that hunger may kill poor Nigerians as a result of the lock down. In a post on his Facebook page, the IPOB leader stated that government should be more particular about the welfare of Nigerians. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari and some state governors had ordered a lockdown as a measure to curb the spread of COVID-19 across the country. However, Kanu in a post wrote: “There must be something wrong with the brain of a black African man, especially those in authority. I don’t know if this raw animalistic wickedness is genetic predisposition or if it was caused by centuries of Arabian and European humiliation and bastardisation of our essence as a race. “Whatever it is, we better reevaluate post-colonial societal structures in Africa because beasts are literally walking the streets in human form. This level of primordial barbarism is uncalled for, especially at a time when responsible governments should be showing concern for the welfare of its citizens. “How can you be subjecting innocent people with hungry children to feed to such torture and horrendous physical assault, sometimes leading to death for simply going out to get some food to eat when the same government asked them to stay indoors for days on end without providing food for them? “When other races around the world say Africans are primitively evil, soulless and devoid of human empathy we shout racism, but the level of brutality in the Zoo and other black African countries is a cause for concern.”

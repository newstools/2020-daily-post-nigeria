President, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, has told President Muhammadu Buhari and Governors that it was unfair to have locked states without provision of basic amenities amid the COVID-19 outbreak. NAN quoted him as warning federal and state governments that they may face rebellion from the masses. ASUU said while it understood the reason behind the lockdown, light, food and water should have been provided across Nigeria before the action was taken. The body, in a statement titled ‘COVID-19: Together We Shall Win’, insisted that there must be provision of what Nigerians need to sustain the ‘Stay at home’ order. The union noted that unless needs of the people are made available, the enforcement may not achieve the expected self-isolation and social distancing. Ogunyemi urged governments to give education and healthcare top priority after the coronavirus crisis. “Access to electricity and running water as well as an unbroken chain of food supply and availability of other essential items should be key components of the policy called lockdown”, he noted. “It can be argued that no issue has ever brought humanity so close as the pandemic. The lesson is that more than ever before, the world has come to realise that issues of health and safety know no territorial boundaries. “Political leaders everywhere had better worked with everyone to make our world safe for all. In this our shared globe, no one is safe epidemiologically, socially or physically until everyone is safe”. On Thursday, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN, appealed to President Buhari to unlock Lagos and Abuja on Friday April 3. He observed that effect of the lockdown has been very catastrophic indeed, especially for daily wage earners.

Lionel Messi, Marc-Andre ter Stegen and Frenkie de Jong are the only players safe at Barcelona this summer, as the Spanish giants plan a squad overhaul, ESPN reports. The Catalans will spend less and do more player exchanges as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Barca president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, insisted last month that the club would still be “capable” of bringing in top players. However, Bartomeu hinted that deals could be structured in a very different way after the crisis. “There is not going to be as much money in the transfer market because of the pandemic,” Bartomeu said. “But I predict that we are going to see a lot more swap deals.” Barcelona have already committed to two transfers that will be completed in the summer. Forward Francisco Trincao will move to Camp Nou from Braga in a €30million deal and Las Palmas midfielder Pedri will join for an initial €5m.

The Borno State Government has vowed to punish three Imams for flouting the COVID-19 lockdown order by holding Friday congregational prayers. Commissioner for Home Affairs, Information and Culture, Babakura Abba Jatau stated that holding congregational Friday prayers exposed worshippers to risks of spreading COVID-19 in the State. Jatau, who is a member of the State’s High Powered Response Team on COVID-19, spoke during a daily briefing at the State’s Government House in Maiduguri, Borno State. The Commissioner said the three Islamic Scholars had been reported to Shehu of Borno and the Chief Imam preparatory to other punitive measures to be adopted. According to Jatau: ”It is disheartening to tell you that three Islamic Scholars (names withheld) today violated the total lockdown rules by conducting Juma’at prayers in their respective mosques in the metropolis. “The violators have been fished out and would definitely face the full wrath of the law.” The Commissioner also reviewed the lockdown directive, stressing that bread, kosai, iced blocks, and pure water sellers were free to operate from 4pm. “As part of continued review of lockdown measures, the high powered response team has announced that a window of 4pm has been allowed for sellers of bread, sachet water, iced blocks and local foods – kosai, masa and shayi, to meet the needs of fasting citizens who may need food for iftar,” Jatau said.

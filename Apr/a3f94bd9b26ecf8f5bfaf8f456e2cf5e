One person has reportedly been burnt to death following a fire outbreak at the Muda Lawan market in Bauchi State. An eyewitness said the fire started after a truckload of mattresses caught fire on Thursday. According to the eyewitness, efforts are still ongoing to contain the spread of the inferno as several shops and cars parked close to the market have been burnt. However, firefighters on getting to the scene were attacked by angry youths in the area for arriving late. The Muda Lawan market is one of the major and oldest markets in the state capital, Channels TV reports. Efforts to speak to authorities in the area over the incident have proven abortive. The Bauchi fire outbreak is coming less than twenty-four hours after several goods worth millions of naira were razed in the popular Dugbe market in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital.

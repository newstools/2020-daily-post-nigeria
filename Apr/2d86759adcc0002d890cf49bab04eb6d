Chelsea winger, Willian has said he is yet to sign a contract renewal with the Blues because the club offered him a two-year extension. According to Willian, he wanted a three-year extension deal, adding that it is now difficult for him to continue his career at Chelsea. He, however, noted that contract negotiations have now ended after both parties failed to reach an agreement. The Brazilian international’s current contract at Stamford Bridge will expire at the end of the season. The 31-year-old, who joined Chelsea from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, has drawn interest from Juventus and Barcelona in recent months. “A lovely story that I built at Chelsea, I have an extraordinary affection for the fans, for the people who work there, and I identified myself a lot here,” Willian told Brazilian outlet Expediente Futebol. “Everybody knows that my contract with Chelsea ends in a few months, so the renewal is a difficult thing to happen. “I think it will be very difficult for me to renew because Chelsea offered me two years, I asked for three, and it ended there. “We did not talk anymore, and we did not negotiate anymore.”

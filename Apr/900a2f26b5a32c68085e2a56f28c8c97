Arsenal hero, Charlie Nicholas, has urged the club’s manager, Mikel Arteta, to sell Shkodran Mustafi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan this summer transfer window to raise funds for a new contract for captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. DAILY POST recalls that Aubameyang is facing an uncertain future at Arsenal. The Gabon international’s current contract at Emirates will run out in the summer of 2021. “Mikel Arteta wants five or six out, and he wants that money to rebuild. If nothing more is in the pot, sell to rebuild,” Nicholas told Sporting Life. “If you are doing that as a financial package, you are not buying to replace Aubameyang. “You can get rid of Shkodran Mustafi and Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who has been out on loan. This will all help to filter through, so there are easy things to do. “Give him what he wants, get rid of the deadwood, you have the kids, and it would not cost £200m to challenge for the top four once more. “My preference would be to offer Aubameyang what he wants. Everyone will flag up his wages. I have been told differing scenarios, especially with Mesut Ozil.” Aubameyang has scored 61 goals in 97 games for Arsenal so far.

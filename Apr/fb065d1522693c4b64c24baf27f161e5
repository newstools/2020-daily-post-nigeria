The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has appealed to residents of the state not to panic over the high figure of COVID-19 cases in the state. On Sunday, April 19, Lagos recorded 70 new cases, taking the total tally to 379. Of the newly confirmed 70 cases, eight originated from neighboring states. There are now 264 active cases, with 93 having been discharged thus far and 14 fatalities recorded in the state. According to Sanwo-Olu, the “increase in numbers we are seeing is evidence of the success of our evolving strategy of ramping up testing by going into local communities. You may have heard that we have recently set up sample collection centers across our 20 Local Government Areas. “The goal of this expanded testing is to take testing closer to the people, by making it easier for those who fall into the ‘case definition’ to have their samples collected. “As we implement these strategies, and take testing deeper into our neighborhoods and communities, we expect that we will see more positive cases. I must use this opportunity to commend all the teams who are carrying out this active community case search.” Sanwo-Olu, while speaking on Monday at the State House in Marina, also announced that the use of face masks will be enforced from next week.

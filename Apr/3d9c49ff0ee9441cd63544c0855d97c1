The Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has told Muslims in the state, to obey social distancing orders during the month of Ramadan. Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar, observed by Muslims worldwide as a month of fasting, prayer and reflection. Sanwo-Olu stated this on Monday, during a media briefing on COVID-19. “As we prepare to observe Ramadan, let us continue to obey the laws of the land. Any gathering of people numbering above 25 is not acceptable,” he said. Sanwo-Olu also promised that the salaries of health workers in the state would be increased. “We are increasing the salaries of all health workers in Lagos,” he said. The governor also warned against panic, noting that “isolation centres are not death centres. It is important for us not to panic but to obey the regulations that have been put in place.”

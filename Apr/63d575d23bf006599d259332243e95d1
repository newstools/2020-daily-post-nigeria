The Nigerian Government has explained how the billions being donated by private individuals towards the fight against Coronavirus pandemic is being utilized. There have been questions and speculations on how the government is spending and channeling these funds, especially after the ministry of finance requested for more ventilators from US billionaire, Elon Musk. However, at the daily briefing by the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 in Abuja, the National Coordinator of the taskforce, Dr Sani Aliyu explained that the billions donated are not going to the coffers of the government. According to him, the money is in a separate account and has nothing to do with the Federal Government. Aliyu said: ‘The private sector has a separate fund which is run through the Coalition Against Coronavirus Disease. “That’s where you get most of the announcements that this person has given a billion and this is a separate account. It has nothing to do with the government and the money will not come to the government. “We appreciate the help of the private sector in helping us and they will be providing us with commodities but the money they are currently collecting will not come to the government. “It is a separate bank account”

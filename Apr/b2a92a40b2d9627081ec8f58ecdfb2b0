There was tension in Abudu community, the headquarters of Orhionmwon local government area on Monday following accusations that the Odionwere (village head), Pa, Sunday Izekor, sexually assaulted a Junior Secondary School (JSS) class two student, simply identified as Gift. Pa Izekor, 82, was said to have sexually abused the teenage girl, 13, at different times before it became public knowledge. Gift was said to have lost her parents some years ago and is currently being accommodated by her uncle. Outraged indigenes mainly youths reportedly took turns to rain curses on the Odionwere, even as many descended on him over the alleged abominable act. It took the intervention of operatives of Abudu Police division to halt the situation from degenerating into chaos. The police were said to have rescued the community leader from the angry mob and took him into custody. Trouble reportedly started for the village head after a friend of the teenager who was in the know of the defilement mocked the 13-year-old over the community leader’s sexual assault on her. One of the youths, who is a state government appointee told DAILY POST that the development drew the attention of Gift’s uncle and neighbours who questioned the rationale behind her friend’s “prank”. Upon further inquiry, gift opened up that the traditional ruler has been having carnal knowledge of her since early 2019. When contacted, the State police spokesman, Chidi Nwabuzor, on a telephone interview said he was yet to be briefed on the development.

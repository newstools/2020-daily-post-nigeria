The Ogun State Police Command said it has arrested a teenager, Ayomide Joseph, and one 20-year-old Olajide Ajisomo for allegedly robbing two persons. The State Police Spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, has confirmed the arrest, adding that the incident happened at Mowe, Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State. DAILY POST learnt that the two suspects had dispossessed two siblings of their belongings at gunpoint. The police said they were arrested after one of the suspects, Adegoke Sodipo, lodged a report at the Mowe police station. The complainant, it was gathered, told the police that they were attacked at Ikugbonmire junction, Mowe, while coming from Lagos. According to Oyeyemi, the victims reported to the police that the suspects made away with their Infinix phone valued at N25,000, and ATM card and so-safe Corps identity card. He said, “Adegoke stated further that he and his brother raised the alarm, which attracted passers-by and one of the hoodlums was apprehended by members of the public.” Upon the report, the DPO, Mowe Division, SP Marvis Jayeola, was said to have quickly dispatched detectives to the scene, where the arrested suspect of the gang was handed over to the police. The arrest of one of the suspects had aided the arrest of the other suspect as operatives reportedly embarked on intelligence-based investigation. “A locally-made double-barrelled shot gun was recovered from the suspects,” Oyeyemi said on Tuesday.

The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, has commended the Lagos State Police Command for prosecuting high-profile individuals, who violated the lockdown order imposed by President Muhammadu Buhari. Recently, Nollywood actress Funke Akindele was arrested and charged to court, for holding a birthday party for her husband, Abdul Rasheed Bello (JJC). There were well over 20 attendees at the event, including Azeez Fashola (Naira Marley) and former Lagos state governorship aspirant, Babatunde Gbadamosi. Both have also been detained by police in Lagos. Mustapha, who is the chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, speaking during a press briefing on Tuesday, said no one is above the law. “Reports have been received of the general level of satisfactory compliance in Lagos with the lockdown order and we have similarly received reports of violations. “In this case, I commend the governor of Lagos State with his institutions for the instant action of the government by prosecuting and convicting notable violators, which shows that nobody is above the law,” Mustapha said.

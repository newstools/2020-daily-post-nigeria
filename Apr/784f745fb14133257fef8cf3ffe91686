Arsenal are resigned to losing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang this summer and have placed a £30million price tag on the Gabon international, the UK Sun reports. Aubameyang has 14 months left on his current deal and talks over an extension have not progressed. That leaves the Gunners in a tight spot, especially with the financial hit that the club expect to take from the coronavirus crisis. Aubameyang would ordinarily be worth around £55m-£60m on the market, if he was not close to the end of his contract. However, with clubs unlikely to sanction big money moves, Arsenal will accept bids of around £30m. The 30-year-old is attracting interest from Barcelona and Chelsea. Arsenal’s preference would be to sell to a club abroad instead to their London rivals.

The National Centre for Disease and Control, NCDC has debunked reports that Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele is one of its ambassadors. Funke Akindele appeared in an advert on NCDC website where she was educating Nigerians on preventive measures against coronavirus. Reports had that the ‘Jenifa’ crooner was an ambassador to the agency. However, her recent action where she organized a house party and violated the lockdown order by the state and federal government raised concerns about her tainting the image of the agency. But, NCDC in a post on its Twitter page said the agency has not engaged any brand ambassador as part of its response to Covid-19. The tweet read: “As an agency of the Federal Government of Nigeria, NCDC has not engaged brand ambassadors as part of our response to Covid-19. “We continue to emphasise that all Nigerians maintain social distancing to prevent the spread of #COVID19.Stay home and stay safe.” Also, Dettol in a statement on its Twitter page stressed that the advert with Funke Akindele is a collaboration to help NCDC educate communities about the spread of Coronavirus. The tweet read: “The NCDC partnered with Dettol on a public service message to educate our communities about preventive measures against COVID-19. Funke is not a brand ambassador of the NCDC. “As a responsible organization and brand Dettol does not condone any breach of the guidelines on Covid-19. As an organization we are concerned at the turn of events. “We will continue to support NCDC and the Nigerian govt to fight COVID-19.” Meanwhile, Police in a statement signed by DSP Bala Elkana, Police Public Relations Officer and forwarded to DAILY POST on Sunday, arrested Funke Akindele for violating restriction orders in Lagos State. This was few hours after the actress apologized for her actions on her Instagram page.

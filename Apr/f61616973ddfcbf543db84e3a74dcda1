Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has urged the club to make a transfer move for Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, or Atletico Madrid stars, Saul Niguez and Thomas Partey this summer. He also advised the Red Devils to make a move for Napoli centre-back, Kalidou Koulibaly, or Norwich City defender, Ben Godfrey. Man United has already signed Bruno Fernandes and Odion Ighalo last January transfer window, but Ferdinand believes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side still needs two to three players this summer to compete for the Premier League title next season. “I would maybe go get Partey from Atletico Madrid or Ndidi from Leicester,” Ferdinand said on The Beautiful Game podcast. “I like Saul Niguez. He’s a very, very good player in midfield. “And then a centre-back, they still need a centre-back. “Whether you go for a young one like Ben Godfrey or someone like Kalidou Koulibaly. “I don’t know, and it is difficult.” Man United was sitting in the fifth position on the Premier League table before the season was suspended indefinitely due to coronavirus.

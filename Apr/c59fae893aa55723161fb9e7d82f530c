Atiku Abubakar, former Vice President, has warned Nigeria and the rest of Africa that the continent is yet to see the worst of the effects of Coronavirus (COVID-19). He also urged all countries in Africa to come together and seek debt forgiveness, as a direct consequence of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the continent’s economies. Atiku said this in a report he titled: ‘What Africa Must Do To Mitigate the Damaging Effects of CoronaVirus,’ and posted on his official Twitter page on Tuesday evening. He said: “COVID-19 has wreaked such damage to the world’s economy, and this is now very evident in the West. “The reason countries in the Western Hemisphere are reporting more significant numbers than developing nations is primarily due to the availability of testing and real-time information. “Ignorance is not bliss in this instance. We shall soon know the truth, and, sadly, this truth will not set us free. “It will shock us. Had we closed our ports of entry early, we would probably have had better reasons to be hopeful. “However, the past is gone, but we must be proactive in going forward. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Nigeria and other African nations are yet to see the worst of the effects of this scourge. “That is why we should unite together and seek debt forgiveness, as a direct consequence of the impact of this pandemic on our economies.” The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared Coronavirus a global pandemic. The disease has killed nearly 6,000 people globally in less than three months.

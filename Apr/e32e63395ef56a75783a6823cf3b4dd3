Cesc Fabregas has said his former Barcelona team-mate, Lionel Messi, will finish his career as a one-club man and retire at Barcelona. Messi moved to Barca when he was 13 and has been at Camp Nou ever since. Recently, the Argentine superstar has been linked with a move away, especially since he has the power to walk away from his current contract. But Fabregas remains convinced that his close friend is going nowhere. “I speak with Messi and his idea has always been to end his career at Barcelona,” he told Cadena Cope. “Many things can happen at a club but I am fully confident that his career will end at Barca.”

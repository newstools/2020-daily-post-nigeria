Anambra State government has issued a fresh directive, cancelling the closure of all food markets and relocating it to other spaces. A release by the state government had on Monday stated that from Tuesday, food markets will now operate in new places to enhance social distancing. But the state commissioner for information, Mr C.Don Adinuba who spoke to DAILY POST on phone, said the decision has been cancelled. “Food sellers will now relocate to their original markets as against the previous directive. “This is because the spaces where the markets were relocated does not allow for social distancing, so the food sellers will now relocate to their original market, but will only hold three times a week; Monday, Wednesday and Friday. It’s just a little policy adjustment,” he said. Meanwhile, an unsigned press statement by the state government, being circulated on the social media has further corroborated commissioner’s stand. The release read, “I am directed to inform u that, H.E the Executive Governor of Anambra State has directed that all Markets to be re-opened. All the closed food stuff market in all the LGA’s be re-opened with immediate effect. “Community leadership are to ensure that, only those who sale food items and essential food items are allowed to open their shops in the market. “The current arrangement which started yesterday 14/04/2020 be disbanded immediately.

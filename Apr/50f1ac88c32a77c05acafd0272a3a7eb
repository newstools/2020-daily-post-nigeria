Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, is among one of the three Gunners players resisting the club’s efforts to implement a squad-wide 12.5 percent pay-cut. DAILY POST recalls that Arsenal on Monday announced a voluntary agreement with Arsenal first-team players, head coach and core coaching staff to cut salaries for 12 months, to ease financial difficulties during the Coronavirus (COVID-19) crisis. “We are pleased to announce that we have reached a voluntary agreement with our first-team players, head coach and core coaching staff, to help support the club at this critical time,” Arsenal said in a statement. “The move follows positive and constructive discussions. In these conversations, there has been an evident appreciation of the gravity of the current situation caused by the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. “Reductions of total annual earnings by 12.5 percent will come into effect this month, with the contractual paperwork being completed in the coming days.” According to the Daily Mail, Ozil, who is Arsenal’s highest earner on £350,000-a-week, has made it clear he wants to be sure of the full financial impact of the COVID-19 before making a completely informed decision. The former Real Madrid star is currently on self-isolation following the suspension of the Premier League due to the spread of Coronavirus across the world.

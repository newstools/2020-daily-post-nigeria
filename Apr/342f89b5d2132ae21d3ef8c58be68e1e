England and Leeds United football legend, Norman Hunter, has died after testing positive for Coronavirus. The 76-year-old was admitted earlier this week at the hospital after developing symptoms of COVID-19. Hunter, a member of England’s 1966 World Cup winners, died at the age of 76. A Leeds United spokesperson confirmed his death in a terse statement on Friday. The statement reads: “Norman was taken to hospital last week after being diagnosed with COVID-19 and despite continuing to battle and the best efforts of NHS staff, he sadly lost his fight earlier this morning.” Hunter, who won 28 England caps, was part of the England World Cup squad that won the tournament on home soil in 1966. The football legend made 28 appearances for England between 1965 and 1974.

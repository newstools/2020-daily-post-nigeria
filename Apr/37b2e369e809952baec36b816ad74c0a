Philippe Coutinho’s agent, Kia Joorabchian, has said that the player “would love a return to the Premier League,” one day, while admitting he is a supporter of Arsenal. However, Joorabchian insists he will not influence which English club Coutinho chooses. The Brazilian midfielder is presently on loan at Bayern Munich from Barcelona. The Bundesliga champions are not expected to make the deal permanent, which means the 27-year-old might be on the move again this summer. Coutinho, who had previously played for Liverpool, is attracting attention from Chelsea and Arsenal. “The fact that I’m an Arsenal supporter is not a secret,” Joorabchian told Sky Sports News. “I don’t have any preference where the players go. I don’t try to push someone to one club or another. Everything is a possibility. “The Premier League is something that he has always enjoyed playing in, and loved playing in, and would probably love to come back and play in.”

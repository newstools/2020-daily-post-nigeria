Kano State, on Wednesday, ‘miraculously’ recorded zero cases of coronavirus. This came as a shock to Nigerians as the state experienced a hike in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the past few days. DAILY POST recalls that the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Tuesday confirmed 16 cases in Kano bringing the total number to seventy-three (73). However, the ‘miracle’ of zero case may be as a result of the suspension of testing at the COVID-19 test laboratory centre of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, in Kano State. The Director, Centre for Infectious Diseases Research, Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH), Prof. Isah Abubakar had disclosed that the operations at the center were suspended after they ran out of test kits, such as reagents. Currently, Nigeria has 873 confirmed cases in 26 states. The NCDC recorded 73 cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday in Lagos State. Also, the ‘miracle’ in Kano came at a time where there are reports of mass death in the state. The National Coordinator of Presidential Task Force, Sani Aliyu announced on Tuesday that a team had been set up to begin investigation into the alleged mass death.

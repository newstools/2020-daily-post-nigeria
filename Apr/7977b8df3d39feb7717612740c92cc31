Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has warned that it will not be “business as usual” for the club in the transfer market, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. According to ESPN, Woodward hinted that the days of £100million deals may be over. The Coronavirus pandemic has led to panic at some clubs, with concerns about the financial impact of the suspension of football. Woodward insists United’s financial might means the club can show more “resilience”, but does not want to raise expectations. “Nobody should be under any illusions about the scale of challenge facing everyone in football and it may not be ‘business as usual’ for any clubs, including ourselves, in the transfer market this summer,” he said. “As ever our priority is the success of the team, but we need visibility of the impact across the whole industry, including timings of the transfer window, and the wider financial picture, before we can talk about a return to normality. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has previously said the instability might help United “exploit” the transfer market. Solskjaer is interested in Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sancho and Aston Villa midfielder Jack Grealish.

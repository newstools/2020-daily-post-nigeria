The President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has pledged to support Nigerians with food during the COVID-19 lockdown. Speaking on Channels TV, Pinnick noted that it was the federation’s way of supporting the federal government in the fight against the pandemic. “Behind the scene, we do quite a lot. We are going to support some of these centres even if it is buying some tubers of yams. “We have to do that. Covid-19 is something that nobody expected,” he said. Nigeria currently has 343 cases of the coronavirus as at Monday night. It has led to President Muhammadu Buhari extending an initial two-week lockdown by another 14 days.

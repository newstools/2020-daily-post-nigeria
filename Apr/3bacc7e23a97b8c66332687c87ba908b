The Kano State Police Command has arrested 30 youths for violating the lockdown order imposed to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the state. Abdullahi Haruna, the Commands’ spokesman, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the youths were allegedly involved in a football match. A video that went viral on social media platforms on Monday, had shown hundreds of enthusiastic soccer fans watching a football match in an undisclosed location in Kano metropolis, in defiance to the social distancing and lockdown orders. According to him, the suspects were arrested on April 20, at about 5 p.m. after they played a football match in Dala Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. “The suspects were arrested for defying the lockdown order and playing a football match at Dala LGA in Kano metropolis. “Already, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Habu Sani, has ordered that the matter be transferred to the State Criminal Intelligence Department (SCID) for investigation, and the suspects will soon be arraigned.” Haruna, therefore, urged the youths in the state to respect the lockdown order, practice social distancing and avoid playing football to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “Anyone found on the street playing football will be arrested and made to face the wrath of the law. “All public gatherings are banned; no roaming about will be tolerated,” he said.

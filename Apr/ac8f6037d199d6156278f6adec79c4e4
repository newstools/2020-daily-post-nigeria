The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu, has directed the Commissioners of Police in states where the COVID-19 social restriction orders have been emplaced to continue with the due enforcement of the orders during the Easter celebrations. A statement by the Force spokesman, Frank Mba, a Deputy Commissioner of Police, on Thursday in Abuja, said they are also directed to ensure that officers and men conduct themselves in line with extant laws and standard best practices. He noted that the call has become necessary in order to curtail the community spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has immensely challenged humanity across all spheres of life. Mba said the IGP tasked Christians to emulate and adopt the selfless lifestyle of Christ as they join other Christians around the globe to celebrate Easter. “The IGP calls on religious leaders in Lagos, Ogun and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) as well as other States affected by the restriction orders, to continue to cooperate with relevant government agencies and use their leadership positions to encourage worshippers to observe Prayers and Worship Programs in the confines of their homes. “The IGP expresses deep concerns that for the first time in the annals of our history, circumstances have compelled us to emplace restrictions on social gatherings, which inevitably is also affecting religious programs of all faiths. He, therefore, enjoins Nigerians to see the restrictions in the light of the symbolism of Easter, which connotes sacrifice, tolerance, perseverance, love, and ultimate triumph,” the statement added. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria is 276, according to NCDC.

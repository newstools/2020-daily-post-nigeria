A pregnant nurse, Mary Agyapong, has died after testing positive for coronavirus in the U.S. According to the Sun UK, the 28-year-old delivered her baby in an emergency c-section but tragically died soon after on Sunday, though it was unclear if the child had tested positive for the deadly bug. According to reports, Mary’s condition had initially appeared to have improved before it deteriorated. David Carter, CEO, Bedfordshire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, in a statement on Wednesday, said it was a great loss as Mary was a highly valued member of their team. “It is with great sadness that I can confirm the death of one of our nurses, Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong, who passed away on Sunday (12th April). “Mary worked here for five years and was a highly valued and loved member of our team, a fantastic nurse and a great example of what we stand for in this Trust. “She tested positive for Covid-19 after being tested on 5th of April and was admitted to the hospital on the 7th April. “Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with Mary’s family and friends at this sad time.” Carter further stated that the decision to perform an emergency caesarean was made as her condition worsened. He said the survival of her baby daughter was a “beacon of light at this very dark time”. According to reports, Mary had been on maternity leave prior to her death and had not been in contact with any patients while infected. She is thought to have acquired the infection in the community and not in the hospital.

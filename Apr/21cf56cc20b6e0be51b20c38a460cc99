The Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, has faulted the 14 days lockdown extension by President Muhammadu Buhari. CUPP said the lockdown extension without putting adequate palliatives for Nigerians was “insensitive.” Spokesperson of CUPP, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere warned that the extension could lead to hunger and social unrest. In a post on his official Facebook page, Ugochinyere wrote: “Opposition Coalition (CUPP) describes President Buhari’s extension of lockdown of Abuja, Lagos and Ogun for another 14 days without putting in Place a sustainable, robust and far reaching palliative to reduce the sufferings of Nigerians as insensitive and a recipe for hunger induced Social Unrest.” Recall that Buhari in a nationwide broadcast had yesterday extended the lockdown in Lagos, Abuja and Ogun States by another 14 days. The aim of the lockdown was to further contain the spread of Coronavirus across the country. During his address, Buhari, however, revealed that his government will support additional one million families, thereby raising the palliative register to 3.5m Nigerians.

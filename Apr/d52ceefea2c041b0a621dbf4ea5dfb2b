The Premier League is set to return in a matter of weeks, the UK Sun reports. This follows plans to play matches behind closed doors, but for games to be shown for free on TV. Ever since the fixtures were suspended, there has been debate about how the 2019/2020 campaign should be concluded. All the top flight teams are believed to be desperate to finish the season no matter what it takes. With the UK still in lockdown, it is unlikely supporters will be allowed in stadiums before next year. It is also thought games could be streamed on terrestrial channels, amid worries that friends will gather at each othersâ€™ houses, if they do not have access to Sky Sports or BT Sport. The news comes after the Bundesliga announced they were prepared to resume their season again by May 9. Holland and Belgium are however among the nations who have decided to cancel their campaigns.

The Federal Government has said it will not allow Nigerians who return from abroad to self-isolate. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, stated this at the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 daily briefing on Friday in Abuja. “We will not accept the request to self-isolate because it will be difficult to monitor them. That is our position,” he said. Onyeama revealed that some Nigerians willing to come back home were asking for self-isolation in their homes. However, he made it clear that such requests could not be granted, as monitoring them would be difficult. Onyeama also admitted that the limited bed spaces and isolation centres in the country might have informed their demand to self-isolate. “The truth is that we do not have enough isolation centres and bed spaces. ”We are looking for hotels in Lagos and I have spoken to the Governor of Lagos. If we can get some, that’ll be fine,” the Minister added.

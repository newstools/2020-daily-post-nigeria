A legal practitioner and Human Rights Activist, Barr. C.J Oguzie has accused policemen in Imo State of maltreating citizens and extorting money from them. The lawyer told DAILY POST correspondent on phone, that the policemen at several checkpoints in the capital city had become a thorn in the flesh of private drivers. Hear him, “this is not a hearsay, I was an eyewitness at the Imo State University junction where policemen used sharp objects to puncture people’s tyres for refusing to settle them. “We actually know that there is a lockdown in the State because of the Coronavirus disease, and people are trying their best to abide by the directives. The idea of molesting private drivers probably on essential duties, leaves much to be desired. “The police should be civil in discharging its duty during this lockdown or it degenerates to something worse than the virus.” He called on the state Commissioner of police to call his men to order or the people may be forced to revolt. Similarly, he frowned at the several checkpoints in the capital city, describing it as nothing short of militarization.

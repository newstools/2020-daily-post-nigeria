American superstar, Pink has tested positive for Coronavirus. The singer disclosed this in an Instagram post shared on Friday night, adding that she got tested two weeks ago and came out positive with her 3-year-old son, Jameson. Her post reads; “My three-year-old son, Jameson, and I were showing symptoms of COVID-19 two weeks ago. Fortunately, our primary care physician had access to tests and I tested positive. My family isolated at home for the last two weeks following the instruction of our doctor. “Just a few days ago, we were re-tested and are now thankfully negative.” She took a swipe at the US Government for unavailability of Coronavirus test kits to health workers and its citizens. According to her, the government has failed for not making ‘testing’ free and widely accessible. ” People need to know that the illness is serious and affects the young and old, healthy and unhealthy, rich and poor, and we must make testing free and more widely accessible to protect our children, our families, our friends and our communities. The singer further donated the sum of $500,000 to the Temple University Hospital Emergency Fund in Philadelphia in honour of her mother, Judy Moore, who worked there for 18 years. Pink also donated another $500,000 to Los Angeles Mayor’s Emergency COVID-19 Crisis Fund. “Thanks to all of our healthcare professionals working so hard to protect our loved ones. You are our heroes! “These next two weeks are crucial, please stay home,” she added.

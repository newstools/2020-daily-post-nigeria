U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, on Wednesday accused the World Health Organization, WHO, of failure to implement its rules on China over the Coronavirus pandemic. The Secretary of State, accused WHO director general of failing “to go public” after a member state did not follow WHO rules on disclosing data, NAN reports. According to him, “WHO regulatory arm clearly failed during this pandemic.” Pompeo reiterating China’s mishandling of the coronavirus outbreak said they made it impossible to track the evolution of Coronavirus by refusing to share the virus sample from inside of China with the outside world. “We strongly believe that the Chinese Communist Party did not report the outbreak of the new coronavirus in a timely fashion to the World Health Organisation. “After Beijing notified the global health body, it didn’t share all of the information it had “Instead it covered up how dangerous the disease is. It didn’t report sustained human-to-human transmission for a month until it was in every province inside of China. “It censored those who tried to warn the world, it ordered a halt to testing of new samples and it destroyed existing samples,” Pompeo told a news conference. Meanwhile, China has reiterated its stand that it did not create the Coronavirus. Foreign Affairs Ministry’s Spokesman, Zhao Lijian, said that there was no evidence that the new Coronavirus was created in a laboratory in Wuhan, China where the virus broke out.

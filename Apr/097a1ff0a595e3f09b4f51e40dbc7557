In a bid to decongest the prison due to coronavirus as directed by President Muhammadu Buhari, the Chief Judge of Rivers State, Justice Adama Iyaye-Lamikanra, has released sixty-one inmates who are under state offense from the three Correctional Facilities in Rivers State. The discharged inmates included forty-six convicted and sixteen awaiting trials persons from Port Harcourt, Degema, and Ahoada custodial centres. Justice Lamikanra asked discharged inmates to be law-abiding citizens. “As you leave here today, do not go back to commit crime because next time you might not be this lucky. Many of you are very young; between ages 21 and 27. So you can work. “You can also look for a good way of earning a living. If there is nothing to do, join farming. It is lucrative or learn a trade. Don’t go back to crime. “You are lucky to be beneficiaries of the directive by the Federal Government that we should release inmates serving for minor offenses. Do not go back to crime. Speaking earlier, the Comptroller of Correction Rivers State Command Olumide Tinuoye said the aim was to decongest the prisons in Rivers State to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the facilities.

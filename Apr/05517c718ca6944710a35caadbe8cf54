Speaking on the provision of the private sector loan facility, the Managing Director of Rosabon Financial Services, Mr. Chukwuma Ochonogor, said. “As Nigerians deal with the growing challenges of COVID-19, our priority is to support them in any way possible. The goal is to provide critical cash flow during this economic crisis at a low interest rate.” Ochonogor added the provision of the company’s loan service became imperative “in the wake of the lockdown due to the ongoing spread of Coronavirus”. He further added “Our hope is that these personal loans will provide individuals access to funds in these dire times, to support their priority short term financial needs.”

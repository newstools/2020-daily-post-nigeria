A former Medical Doctor for Lyon FC, Marcel Garrigou-Grandchamp, has accused Juventus of bringing Coronavirus (COVID-19) to France. Garrigou-Grandchamp believes Coronavirus pandemic entered France when Juventus came into the country to play against Lyon in the Champions League round of 16 first-leg encounter, which ended 1-0 in favour of the host. According to him, the match between Lyon and Juventus should not have been held, adding that football was an accelerator of the disease. Garrigou-Grandchamp told Gazzetta Dello Sport: “That match should not have been played, as it brought Juventus fans to Lyon, which was not a risk area. “Football was an accelerator of the epidemic [Coronavirus].” DAILY POST recalls that the Champions League and all other major competitions in Europe have been suspended due to the spread of Coronavirus across the globe. On February 26, there were only 445 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 20 deaths in Italy, all of them in the north where Juventus is based, on the other hand, in France, there were only 18 cases, with only one death. However, the situation escalated as Italy and France struggle to check the continued spread of the virus.

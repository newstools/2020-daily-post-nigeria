Outspoken cleric, Adewale Giwa, has called on God to expose the antics of governments in locking down millions of Nigerians without food. Giwa, who is the senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, said God knows and sees everything going on in pretence of coronavirus in Nigeria. In a statement sent to DAILY POST on Tuesday, Giwa said,” You can only fool humans, but you cannot fool God. I put it to you that God will expose your lies soon. “How can you lock down people who work on their own without depending on the government? “When David killed Uriah, he thought nobody saw him, until God exposed and dealt with him publicly. “The prediction of Melinda Gates that African nations would be littered with dead bodies specifically meant that people would die as a result of hunger not coronavirus. “We will never experience coronavirus in Nigeria as God liveth. Buhari and his men are bullying the poor. “Only few who enjoy the dividends of democracy are supporting them. “Let me tell you, if any Nigerian should land at Muritala Muhammed today from the United States, they will claim that person is being tested positive for coronavirus. “For how long are you going to deceive the people? God will expose all of you very soon and those who have eyes shall see. “The light will shine in the darkness and the darkness shall never see no more. I am ready to die for speaking the truth than remain alive and deceive the people. “A lot of people are dying now because of hunger, children are dying of malnutrition. The blood of those who die during this hard time shall be upon the government. “After God, the next person who owns the world is Lucifer and that Lucifer is the government. “The Lord will finally tear the kingdom of Lucifer and his men while the righteous will rule the world, according to Psalm 37:29. “I want to advise the children of God to be focused and prayerful. Whatever plans these evil people wish us shall go back to them in Jesus Name. Amen.”

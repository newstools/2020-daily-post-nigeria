Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State on Saturday declared that the State Secretariat, which was shut down due to the Coronavirus pandemic, would open to workers from grade level 13 and above as from Monday. Makinde, who addressed journalists at the end of a meeting of the state’s COVID-19 Task Force, gave guidelines for the reopening of the secretariat. He revealed that the government decided to allow civil servants on Grade Level 13 and above to resume work on certain strict conditions, starting from Monday, April 27, 2020. He said that the state would, from Sunday, begin to take delivery of the one million face masks, which he said would be distributed free to market men and women, artisans, and civil servants, among others. “The State Secretariat will be reopened on Monday, April 27, 2020. Only civil servants at level 13 and above with separate offices will resume. “The following guidelines are in place to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 within the secretariat: There will be new security measures in place including having only one gate to serve as entrance and exit. All other gates will be closed. All meetings will be held online. “No visitors are allowed except absolutely necessary. There will be hand washing facilities in strategic locations around the secretariat. One 100ml hand sanitizer and face masks will be given to each officer. “Bush canteens around the secretariat will remain closed. Officers are encouraged to bring their own food for lunch. Posters and banners will be in conspicuous places in the secretariat to revalidate guidelines for resumption.” Makinde also stated that the dusk to dawn curfew, which currently runs from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m., will be relaxed to 7 p.m. to 5 a.m in order to accommodate farmers during the planting season, adding that farmers are being sensitized on how they could stay safe as they cultivate their farms during the pandemic.

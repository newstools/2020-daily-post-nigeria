Manchester United star, Bruno Fernandes has paid tribute to fellow teammate, Paul Pogba, for the first time since he joined the Red Devils from Sporting Lisbon in the January transfer window.  Fernandes described Pogba as a top player because everyone expects from him as they expect from Juventus’ Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona’s Lionel Messi. The Portuguese international, who is yet to play alongside Pogba in Man United squad, believes he can strike up a good working relationship with the France World Cup winner. Pogba, who is currently recovering from an ankle surgery, last played for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side on Boxing Day of 2019. “Paul is a top player because everyone expects from him as they expect from Ronaldo at Juventus or Messi at Barcelona and Manchester United pay a lot for him,” Fernandes told Man United’s official website on Wednesday. “I know Paul from Juventus because I played against him in the midfield in Italy. And believe me, it’s really hard to play against Paul. “He is big, strong, and technical. It is difficult to find a player like him, and he has a lot of qualities. I hope he comes back soon. “I am confident what Paul can give to us, to think Paul, when he comes back, he will feel this and will give more for the next months and the next games.” Meanwhile, the Premier League is suspended indefinitely due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world.

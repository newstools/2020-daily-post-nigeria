The Premier League are set to meet again on Friday, with more clubs wanting the season concluded by June 30 because of player contracts, according to Sky Sports. The agenda will be how to end the 2019/2020 season, which has been suspended since March because of the coronavirus outbreak. Clubs are doing everything they can to finish the season, rather than declare it null and void. However, the possibility of many contracts ending before the campaign finishes, would affect several clubs. Their worry is that if the season does not end by June 30, out-of-contract and loan players will be able to walk away from their clubs, even though FIFA has recommended that deals due to expire could be extended to the end date of any domestic campaign. No decisions are expected to be ratified at Fridayâ€™s meeting and the season will only restart when the government advises it is safe to do so. Games will most likely be played behind closed doors eventually. Most Premier League teams have nine games left to play, with runaway leaders Liverpool having a 25-point advantage over second-placed Manchester City.

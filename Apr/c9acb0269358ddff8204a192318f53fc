The Nigeria Center for Disease and Control (NCDC) on Wednesday night, reported 91 new COVID-19 cases. Of that number, Lagos recorded 74 new cases – the most ever confirmed in a single day. The total for the state currently stands at 504. It remains the highest in Nigeria, with the Federal Capital Territory just behind with 119. The Governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, was one of the governors who have called for an inter-state lockdown for the next two weeks. The idea is to curb the spread of the coronavirus from state to state. The Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) made the call in a communiqué signed by its Chairman and Governor of Ekiti, Dr Kayode Fayemi and issued after its Wednesday 6th teleconference meeting.

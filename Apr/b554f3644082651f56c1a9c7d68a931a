A 45,000 litres’ tanker was prevented from fire disaster early Friday morning along LASU Igando Expressway at Village Bus Stop. This was made known today by the Acting Head of Lagos State Fire Service, Mrs Margaret Adeseye while briefing journalists. In her explanation, the Lagos State Fire Service received the fire emergency call early morning of Good Friday, ”April 10, 2020 at 0526hrs” to LASU-Igando Expressway. “I swiftly deploy Firefighters from Ojo Fire Station, who on arrival at the scene discovered a leakage from a fully laden 45,000 litres’ Mazda tanker with registration number AAA 198 XZ belonging to Luri filling station, conveying Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, from Apapa to Agbara while spilling it contents.” The Firemen, she explained, battled to neutralize the potency of the contents and averted another potential fire outbreak as the situation was brought under control and the tanker safely arrived at its destination. Adeseye stated that in spite of the lockdown as a measure against the spread of COVID-19, a good number of fire related emergencies have been successfully managed. She, however, assured Lagosians that the Lagos State Fire Service was on full alerts to forestall any eventuality that may result from fire and other related emergencies.

Abia Senator, Enyinnaya Abaribe has opposed any decision either by the Federal or state governments to extend the COVID-19 lockdown. Abaribe, Senate Minority Leader, warned against the planned nationwide lockdown over the pandemic, saying that resorting to the extra measures would ignite a major economic and security crisis that could hurt many Nigerians who depend on daily earnings for their sustenance. The lawmaker warned that pushing for it could be combustible and counter-productive as the people appear too worn-out to soak in further shocks. “I will rather opt for a cautious and guided lifting of the lockdown where the existing measures like protective barriers such as the compulsory wearing of face masks, use of hand sanitizers and other associated sanitary and hygiene precautions are enforced in public places,” Abaribe said in a statement in Abuja on Saturday signed by his Media Adviser, Uchenna Awom. “Aside from the above, daily disinfection of halls, rooms, vehicles, vessels, surroundings et al, must become the new normal. Doing these would definitely tamp the hot air and guide our people to resume their normal life. “My fear is that majority of our people in the informal sector are daily earners hence their survival is predicated on their going out daily if they must survive. Our people operate mostly in the commercial sector, I have the feeling that further extension of the lockdown would hurt the people the more,” he said. He appealed to the government to seriously ponder the economic and security implications of a further extension of the lockdown on the people and on the country as a whole.

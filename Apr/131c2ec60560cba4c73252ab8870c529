Tyson Fury’s promoter, Bob Arum, has announced a new date for the fight between his client and fellow British boxer Anthony Joshua as Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to disrupt sporting events worldwide. DAILY POST had reported that Fury and Joshua are both on course for a unification fight after their next contests against Deontay Wilder and Kubrat Pulev, respectively. Fury knocked out American fighter, Deontay Wilder, in the 7th round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, USA, in their rematch last February to regain the WBC world heavyweight title. Joshua defeated Mexican-American boxer, Andy Ruiz Jr, in their rematch last December. But Arum believes both Fury and Joshua will contest against each other next year in January or February if everything goes well. “Joshua and Fury are the winners,” Arum told IFL TV. “No great catastrophe, they will fight sometime next year in January or February 2021.”

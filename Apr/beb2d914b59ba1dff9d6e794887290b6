Shehu Sani, the former Kaduna lawmaker has warned of the dire consequences of deporting Almajiris to their states of origin. Kano State Governor, Umar Ganduje on Tuesday approved the deportation of Almajiris to their respective states of origin as part of measures to curb the spread of Coronavirus in Kano State. His move has been met with criticisms from all quarters as some believe this will increase the spread of Coronavirus in communities. Reacting, Sani, in a post on his Twitter page warned that the deportation of Almajiris to their villages will increase insecurity in the future. According to him, the Almajiris without education will return as bandits and insurgents. Sani wrote: “When you arrest the dirty and beggarly Almajiri from your Beautiful Cities and ‘deport’ him to his village, away from your tourists, your visitors, your leisure and your sights, you are only hiding your dirty undies instead of cleaning them. “The Almajiri you choose to deport to the villages and refuse to educate and integrate will return to you as Bandits or Insurgents.”

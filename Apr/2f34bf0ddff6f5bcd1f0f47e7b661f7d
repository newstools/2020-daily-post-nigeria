My twins children were kidnapped at gun point at my Ojoo residence Ibadan, around 8 pm Saturday, 10 minutes after I left my home for a recording lecture in a studio. “Everybody should please, for Allah’s sake, assist me in prayer and beg the abductors to please be merciful with me especially their mother who was barren for 12 years. I’m begging, not flexing anything. This is their pictures, help share wide. Oh my God.” Public Relations Officer of the State Police Command, Olugbenga Fadeyi confirmed the abduction.

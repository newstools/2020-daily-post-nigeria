Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, was missing as the first team resumed training at London Colney on Monday, the UK Metro reports. A ‘majority’ of the squad trained at the club’s Hertfordshire base, after the club decided that it was safe to open up their large training base. However, the Gunners enforced strict rules for all players, with each individual having their own ball and parking spot, to reduce contact. The players were also given designated times to arrive and arrived in groups of five, to stem the flow of players through the door. The gym, canteen and indoor training centre remained closed. Arteta and his first-team staff were not present at training, choosing instead to remain at home. The Spaniard tested positive to Coronavirus in March, but has since recovered.

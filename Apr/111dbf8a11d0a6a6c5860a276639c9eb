The Spanish Football Association (RFEF) has announced its decision on the La Liga if the season is abandoned due to the coronavirus pandemic. RFEF General Secretary Andreu Camps, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. He noted that the four clubs on top of the most recently completed round of the La Liga season standings would qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League. Consequently, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Sevilla and Real Sociedad are the four teams that will go through. Clubs had played 27 matches before the RFEF suspended play on March 12. “The RFEF wants to have done its homework in case, in the event of a suspension of competitions, it receives the request from UEFA regarding the Spanish clubs that would have access to European competitions next season,” Camps said. “It has been agreed in the RFEF Delegate Commission to make a plan in order to give certainty in an extreme scenario, such as not being able to finish the competitions, so that all the clubs know the new scenario they are facing.” Getafe and Atletico Madrid, the teams in fifth and sixth place will qualify for the Europa League. However, the result of the Copa Del Rey final, if played, could impact which team grabs the final Europa League spot.

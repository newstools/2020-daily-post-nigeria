The Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) has warned residents of the state, that defying COVID-19 lockdown order is embarking on suicidal mission. LASTMA General Manager, Olajide Oduyoye, stated this in an interview with NAN on Saturday. “It is very difficult to understand how we are trying to prevent people from killing themselves by violating the stay-at-home order and some still do not understand the implications for them and their loved ones,” Oduyoye said. The LASMA boss also advised officers on the road to be very careful and remain safety conscious. According to him, this has become necessary, since LASTMA officers are not wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Lagos has so far recorded 657 Coronavirus cases, the highest in the country.

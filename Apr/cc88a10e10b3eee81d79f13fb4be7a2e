Yobe State COVID-9 Prevention and Control Committee has disclosed that the 30-year-old man suspected of having the virus has tested negative. Chairman of the Committee and the State Deputy Governor, Idi Barde Gubana, made the disclosure on Saturday at a press conference in Damaturu. Gubana said, “You may wish to recall that a 30-year-old truck driver arrived at the GOPD of General Hospital Potiskum, with a six-day history of fever, cough and difficulty in breathing. “He had a history of travelling to Lagos over the last seven days. “During yesterday’s press briefing by the Hon. Commissioner, who is also the Vice-Chairman of COVID-19 committee; you were informed that all standard public protocols and guidelines were followed. “His specimen was collected and sent to a laboratory in Abuja for testing. I am happy to announce to you that the result of the test came out negative as such the person does not have Coronavirus disease. He is currently doing much better and he will soon be discharged”, he announced. The Committee Chairman, however, advised people in the state to ensure: frequent personal and environmental hygiene, proper respiratory etiquettes as well as social distancing by avoiding crowded areas among others as recommended by the COVID-19 Committee. “For the sake of the health of others, those coming from Lagos, Abuja or anywhere with cases of confirmed COVID-19 should go into self-isolation for 14 days”, he urged. Recall that DAILY POST had reported that a suspected COVID-19 case was recorded in Potiskum town in Yobe state. A development that threw residents of the densely populated town into a state of panic.

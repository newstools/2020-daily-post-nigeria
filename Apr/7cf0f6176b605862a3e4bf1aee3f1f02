Liverpool’s Champions League match with Atletico Madrid on March 11, will be investigated by the city’s council, to determine the impact it may have had on the spread of COVID-19. The World Health Organisation declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, on the same day the fixture was played. About 52,000 fans were in attendance at Anfield, with around 3,000 fans making the trip from Spain. “Liverpool City Council, alongside partners at the University of Liverpool and John Moores University, have agreed to explore any impact of Covid-19 as a result of the Atletico Madrid match at Anfield on March 11,” a spokesman for Liverpool City Council said. “Liverpool City Council’s public health team, alongside partners are currently assessing the size and scope of the project.” Mayor of Madrid, Jose Luis Martinez-Almeida, has said it was a “mistake” for fans to travel to England. Atletico beat the Premier League leaders 3-2 in their round-of-16 second-leg match. It was the last Champions League fixture to be played with fans present, before the competition was suspended.

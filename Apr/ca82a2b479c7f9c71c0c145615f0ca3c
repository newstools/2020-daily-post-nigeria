As Nigeria continues to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the Edo state police command on Tuesday arrested fifty persons for violating the lockdown order imposed by the state government. DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, the command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), said this while briefing newsmen on Tuesday. The Edo Government had on Sunday imposed a statewide dusk-to-dawn curfew, which commenced on Monday and was to last from 7pm to 6am daily. The move was part of the state government’s measures to curtail the spread of the Coronavirus in the state. The violators have been charged to the mobile court at Urhokpota for prosecution. “The clampdown on violators was necessitated by the Edo Government’s address on Sunday imposing a dusk to dawn curfew in the state. “The command together with other sister security agencies in the state commenced enforcement immediately the curfew commenced on Monday. “The 50 persons apprehended represents the number of violators from the various divisions of the command as well as the state command headquarters.’’ Meanwhile, Mrs Beatrice Imade, the Coordinator of the COVID-19 mobile court, told NAN that the mobile courts had been handling an average of 40 violation cases per day since it was set up.

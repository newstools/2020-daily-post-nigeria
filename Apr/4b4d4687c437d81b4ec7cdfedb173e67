Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege said on Saturday that death has dealt Nigeria a very rude shock with the passing of Chief of Staff to the President, Malam Abba-Kyari, saying that Nigerians must pray for President Muhammadu Buhari for divine help in charting the way forward. Omo-Agege expressed sadness that Kyari who had been one of the President’s major pillars of support, succumbed to the Coronavirus disease. “Malam Abba Kyari was a very hard-working patriot. I still recall his last official statement in which he admonished us all about the Coronavirus pandemic’s virulent threat to everyone without any consideration for class, creed or place of origin. “There is no doubt about his encompassing influence and bold imprints in the conduct of official affairs at the presidency over the past five years. “Sadly, his exit came at a time when the world is reeling under unprecedented challenges and at a time when his counsel is most needed. “Clearly, such grave loss will be deeply felt by President Muhammadu Buhari, and we should pray that God Almighty grant Mr. President and Malam Kyari’s family the strength to bear this irreparable loss. “May God Almighty grant his soul eternal repose,” he stated.

Some Nigerian celebrities have begged the Lagos state government and the police to release her colleague, Funke Akindele-Bello. Funke Akindele was arrested on Sunday for disobeying restriction orders by the state and federal government. The Lagos State Police command on Monday arraigned the actress and her husband, JJC Skillz, before a Chief Magistrate Court in Ogba, Lagos State. The couple were arraigned for breaching the Lagos Infection Diseases Regulations 2020 (the Regulations) which prescribes a jail term of one month or N100,000 fine or both for persons found guilty of hosting gatherings or flouting the lockdown order. But the recent development has stirred reactions from some celebrities demanding for her release. Actress Mary Njoku on her Instagram page appealed that the actress be released. She, however, asked if politicians and others who held gatherings amid the lockdown have been arrested too. Her post reads: “Are all, I mean all the politicians, Pastors, Nigerians who have held parties, gatherings, photo sessions, rallies, and opening ceremonies in Jail? “I am not making excuses for her please. Just asking. Yes, she was wrong. Nobody is perfect. Release Funke, she is sorry.” Also, Uche Elendu appealed to the Lagos State government to release her for the sake of her twins. “Please, release her. I do not have any excuses to make for her because the law is simple. No social gathering but her humble and sweet spirit doesn’t deserve this arrest. “We are sorry on her behalf; please Jide Sanwo-Olu. “She explained and apologized. Please listen and forgive, at least people ate food at the party. The people that clustered people to share 2 packs of indomie in the name of quarantine relief were not arrested. Please forgive her. “Nigerians please the same way you got her arrested through social media, please beg them to release her, her twins are crying.”

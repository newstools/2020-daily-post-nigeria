Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, has imposed a new restriction he described as ‘no nose mask, no movement.’ In a press statement signed by Mr Christian Ita, Special Adviser Media and Publicity to the Governor and made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday night, the governor also imposed a total shut down of entry and exit points into the state. The action, it gathered may not be unconnected with the discovery of five persons in a neighbouring State, Akwa Ibom who have tested positive for the deadly coronavirus. Mr Ita said, “Following the proliferation of new cases of coronavirus in neighbouring state, the Cross River State Governor, Sir Ben Ayade, has imposed new restrictions on residents of the state as follows: “All exit and entry points into the state are now completely shut. No human or vehicular movement will be allowed into the state under any disguise. “No citizen or resident of the state will be allowed to leave home without a face mask from Friday 3rd, April 2020. Failure to adhere to this directive will lead to the arrest and quarantine of the offenders for 14 days. “The Cross River State garment factory has been mandated to produce face masks to be distributed free to citizens and residents alike to meet with the demand. “Those who for one reason or the other are unable to get masks from government before the new restrictions kick start are advised to purchase theirs from shops selling the item. “All public gatherings remain banned, markets should remain closed except where foodstuff is sold,” the statement added.

The Lagos State Government, on Thursday, warned residents embarking on vigilante operations during the COVID-19 lockdown. Mrs Aramide Adeyoye, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Works and Infrastructure, in a statement, warned residents on vigilante operations to desist from setting up bonfire on tarred road surfaces. Adeyoye said that the practice of bonfire could destroy asphalt used to construct the road, adding that the roads rehabilitated with taxpayers’ money were being destroyed by the heat generated from bonfire. ”Burning of tires directly on the roads where taxpayers’ money has been expended is unpatriotic and environmentally hazardous. ”More importantly, it compromises the integrity of the pavement and overall riding surface, especially now that the rains are about to commence,” she said. She noted that adherence to the warning would prevent the need for further expenditure on infrastructure in the face of scarce resources.

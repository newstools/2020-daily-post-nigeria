A group under the auspices of the Centre for Human Rights and Anti-Corruption Crusaders, CHURAC, has said the Social Investment Programme of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government is a “scam”. CHURAC’s National President, Cleric Ebikonbowei Alaowei made the assertion in a chat with DAILY POST correspondent in Warri. “The figures bandied in the internet as people from every State that have benefited from the scheme by the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development shows that Buhari’s Social Investment Programme is a conduit pipe by looters to fritter away our common patrimony. “You can see the whole country including the National Assembly, is kicking against the nebulous process associated with the conditional cash transfer. “It lacks transparency. Buhari needs to investigate the skirmishes and overhaul the Programme.” Earlier, Alaowei said, “Ordinarily I would have suggested that lockdown should not be further extended given the economic situation in the affected States but I think that is the best way to curb the community spread of the coronavirus. As a people, we just have to endure the hard time. “It’s said that hard times do not last longer, Nigerians and indeed Deltans must accept it if the State Government extends the lockdown. “After all, that is the best known solution in the world to contain the spread of COVID- 19.”

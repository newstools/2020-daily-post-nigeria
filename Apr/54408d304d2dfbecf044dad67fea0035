Leicester City star, Wilfred Ndidi, has addressed comparisons between him and Chelsea midfielder, N’Golo Kante. Ndidi believes Kante, who played a key role in Leicester City’s Premier League title win in 2016, is a machine. Fans have often compared Ndidi to Kante because both players play defensive midfield roles for their respective clubs. But the Nigerian international has now addressed that talk on an Instagram Live, according to Leicester Mercury. “I have always seen myself as Ndidi, and I want to be seen as Ndidi,” the 23-year-old said. “Kante is a great player, and if you see the way he plays, you’ll know he’s a machine. “The advice I got right from time while I was playing that position is just be yourself. “Every player has his own quality, and it’s not everybody that can be like Ronaldo or Messi, everybody has his own way. “I just want to be myself, play my game, and fight for three points.” Ndidi and Kante are currently in self-isolation after the Premier League was suspended indefinitely due to Coronavirus pandemic

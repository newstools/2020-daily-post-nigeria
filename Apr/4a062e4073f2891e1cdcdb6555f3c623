Arsenal players will return to training at their London Colney training ground next week, ESPN reports. The UK is still under a government-imposed lockdown amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the Gunners will be the first Premier League club, to make a tightly controlled return to training, since English football was suspended on March 13. Players will arrive individually and will already be in their training gear for the session. They will go directly to the outdoor pitches, with all buildings at the training ground closed. Members of the squad will then return home immediately after the session, without showering or having lunch on site as they normally do. The Arsenal players will train in small groups and respect social distancing rules, as imposed by the government.

The Association of Tricycle Riders, Enugu State, has warned its members against the violation of social distancing directives of the State Government. In a statement by the Chairman and the Secretary of the association, Comrade Benjamin Ejiofor Ikah and Comrade Pius N. Ezugwu, respectively, they reminded their members that the directives by the Enugu State government that all tricycle operators in the state should be carrying two passengers only and should not operate beyond the state’s land boundaries, to contain the spread of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), are still in force. The reminder was “sequel to security reports that some tricycle operators have started carrying more than two passengers and are also operating beyond the state’s land boundaries in total defiance of the state government’s orders”. According to the statement, “these urgly acts are capable of sabotaging the cherished and tireless efforts of our dear Governor, His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, in containing the spread of this deadly virus” . The Union, therefore, warned “those involved in these acts to immediately desist from them by carrying only two passengers and stop operating close to or beyond the boundaries”. It disclosed that “furthermore, our taskforce has been directed to apprehend and hand over to the police any tricycle operator caught violating the government’s directives in this regard”. They added that, “these ugly acts are capable of sabotaging the cherished and tireless efforts of our dear Governor, His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, in containing the spread of this deadly virus.”

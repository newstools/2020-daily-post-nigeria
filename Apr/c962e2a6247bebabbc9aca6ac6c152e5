Nigeria’s Minister of State for Finance, Clem Agba, has said no records were lost in the fire, which saw a section of the Treasury House razed on Wednesday. However, the cooling system of the data centre was damaged by the fire, before it was eventually contained. The fire gutted some rooms at the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation in Abuja on Wednesday. “We have gone round the rooms and offices where the fire has affected and I’m glad to announce to you our data centre where all our records are kept are intact. “No destruction, so we haven’t lost any record. “I have to inform you that for some time now we have gone digital, but still have a few things that we do manually, but a lot of things now is online. Even if the data centre were to be affected we have a back up that is kept outside of Abuja in case we lose the data centre,” Agba told reporters. According to the minister, a staff claimed that the fire was started by a faulty air conditioner. But he added: “the right professionals would be able to tell us whether it is the air conditioner and something more.”

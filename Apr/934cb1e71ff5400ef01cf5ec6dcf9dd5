His wife, Amanda Kloots took to her Instagram page to explain and give updates on her husband’s health. She wrote: “I received difficult news, Saturday, was day 18 of my husband being sedated in the intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. “While hospitalized, he started having clotting issues on his right leg, and could not get blood down to his toes. The blood thinners he got to fix the clotting issues were affecting his blood pressure and causing internal bleeding in his intestines. “We took him off blood thinners but that again was going to cause some clotting in the right leg, so the right leg will be amputated today She added that he made it through surgery and hopes to recover soon. “He made it through the surgery, which is really big,” her post read.

Leadership of the Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, has declared its position on the appointment of a new Chief of Staff by President Muhammadu Buhari. Nigerians are eagerly waiting for the announcement of a new Chief of Staff by the President after Abba Kyari who occupied the position, died and was buried on Saturday. Though, several names are flying about in the media on who the president may decide to pick to fill the void left by Abba Kyari, the AYCF National President, Mr. Yerima Shettima, while speaking to DAILY POST on Monday, said it is strictly Buhari’s decision to make. On the agitation and plea by some groups, including the Ohanaeze Youth Council, for the President to pick the next Chief of Staff from the Southeast, Shettima said Arewa youth do not care how Buhari fill the position. The group also commiserated with President Buhari and Abba Kyari’s family, friends and well-wishers over the passing of the Chief of Staff. Kyari died of complications from the novel Coronavirus after undergoing treatments in Lagos State and was buried in Abuja on Saturday. Death is natural. Anybody can die through any means. It’s either you go through the Coronavirus or any means,” Shettima said, adding that there is no story about it. “It is certain about life that someone will die; it is natural. We only pray for the family and those he left behind to bear the pain of their loss. “For the President, it’s a great loss to him. He has said it overtime that Abba Kyari was one of his confidants and a very good friend. “We also hope that whoever he picks as his replacement, will be honest and sincere to him. “Replacement is purely and strictly the business of the President to decide. It is strictly the choice of the President. Whoever he decides to pick, we are okay with it. I don’t care where he picks from.”

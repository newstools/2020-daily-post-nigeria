Popular Nigerian singer, Davido has reacted to the fire incident at the office of the Accountant-General of the Federation in Abuja. DAILY POST had reported that some rooms at the office of the AGF at the Treasure House Abuja caught fire on Wednesday morning. Firefighters have put out the inferno but the cause is still unknown. There have been insinuations that the inferno is suspicious, especially at a time when huge financial contributions were made to the government to support the fight against Coronavirus. Recall that after Nigeria confirmed its first case of COVID-19, many wealthy Nigerians and the private sector made donations publicly to assist the government. The account was set up under the Private Sector Coalition Against COVID-19. Davido, whose father contributed to the relief fund took to his Twitter page demanding that the government accounts for each kobo spent. His post read: “Make dem return our money oh, which one be say office don burn.
“They must account for each kobo.”

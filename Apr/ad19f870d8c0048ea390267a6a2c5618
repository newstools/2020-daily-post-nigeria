A mobile court in the Adamawa State capital, Yola, has convicted 21 people for violating movement restriction orders of the state government. Governor Ahmadu Fintiri had placed a lockdown on the state, since last week in a move to curtail community transmission of COVID-19, of which an index case has already been recorded and test results of contact persons being awaited. Fifty people were arraigned before the special mobile court in Yola on Monday. Of the number, the court found 21 guilty and sentenced them to two hours of community service. They were made to sweep the Jimeta Modern Market, the biggest market place around the capital city. Operatives of the Nigeria Police lead the security team enforcing the lockdown in Adamawa State. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) of the state, DSP Suleiman Nguroje who gave this indication, had said earlier in the day that his men had arrested several motorists who would also be arraigned before the Special Lockdown Mobile Court.

The police in Jigawa State have given more details about Hansa’u Audu, the 30-year-old man who allegedly killed his 17-year-old wife over sex. The incident occurred at Ringim Local Government area of Jigawa. The spokesman, SP Abdu Jinjiri, spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday in Dutse. Jinjir said Audu reportedly used force on his wife “to satisfy his desire”. He recalled that the police received a report from Kankaleru village on April 21, at about 8 am, that at about 6.30 am, a newly-married lady was found dead in her matrimonial room. Jinjiri gave the name of the lady, whom he said lived in the same address as her husband, Audu. “Upon receipt of the information, the police rushed to the scene and took the body of the lady to the hospital where it was confirmed dead by a doctor. The police strongly suspected the husband of the deceased and arrested him for interrogation. “Investigation revealed that at about 4 am, the suspect went to her (the deceased) as husband, but she turned down his request, as he was not the one she intended to marry, in the first place. In the process, he was suspected to have used serious force on her to satisfy his desire and she consequently died,” Jinjiri disclosed. The Police confirmed that the case is under investigation at the State Criminal Investigations Department (SCID).

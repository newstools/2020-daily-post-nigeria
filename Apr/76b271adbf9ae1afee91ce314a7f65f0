Manchester United forward, Marcus Rashford, has admitted he prefers to play from the left-wing. Speaking with UTD Podcast, Rashford said he is often “isolated” when he plays as the main striker. The 22-year-old has excelled in both attacking roles this season, scoring 19 goals in 31 appearances, before suffering a back injury in January. With Anthony Martial assuming the No.9 position when fit, Rashford has revealed he enjoys playing from the left, because it gives him room to create. “When you are on the left, you can create a lot more things on your own, giving that little bit more to the team. “Whereas when you are playing up front, sometimes you are isolated and need someone in midfield who can find passes for 90 minutes of a game, so you can disappear in games sometimes as a number nine. “When I transitioned to a number nine when I was younger, that’s the bit that I struggled with as I was always someone who wanted to express myself on the ball,” Rashford said.

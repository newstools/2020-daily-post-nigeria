The Director-General of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, Chikwe Ihekweazu, has admitted that the health agency is currently struggling for bed spaces to accommodate COVID-19 patients across the country. The DG said this at the daily media briefing of the Presidential Task Force, PTF, on COVID-19 on Thursday. He was responding to a question on the lack of bed spaces for COVID-19 patients across the country. Ihekweazu explained that the biggest challenge right now is Lagos, where bed spaces are tight. According to him, “We are struggling at the moment for bed spaces. “Especially Lagos and to an extent, Kano and Abuja too, but the biggest challenge right now is Lagos, where bed spaces are really tight. “Across the country, we have about 3,500 bed spaces identified as available for COVID-19. “But ultimately, we might have to change our strategy a little bit and start considering home care in certain circumstances.” Meanwhile, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had announced that another 196 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the last 24 hours, bringing to 1,728, the number of confirmed cases in the country as of Wednesday night.

UEFA President, Aleksander Ceferin has set a final deadline of August 3 to finish the 2019/20 Champions League as Coronavirus continues to disrupt sporting events globally. DAILY POST recalls that the Champions League and all other European competitions were suspended last month due to the Coronavirus pandemic. “You can work within the current system, or with a single game at home or away, or at a neutral venue,” Ceferin said during an interview with German TV channel ZDF, reported via Mundo Deportivo. “For now, all situations are theoretical, as the situation is extraordinary. But, the Champions League must be finished by August 3. “We must be flexible, and we are working on plans to bring the Champions League and the Europa League back in May, June, and July.” Recall that Ceferin had provided an update last month concerning the resumption date of this season’s Champions League.

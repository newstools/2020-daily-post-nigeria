Road projects awarded by the Adamawa State Government before the COVID-19 outbreak have continued unhindered. Though no COVID-19 case has been confirmed in Adamawa yet, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri had on March 31, effected a lockdown of the state, an order which he relaxed last week, April 15. It was observed, however, that even throughout the two-week lockdown when movement was restricted and civil servants asked to work from home throughout the state, work on the various road projects continued and have continued since then. Getting personally involved in the process on Monday, Governor Fintiri inspected a 4-km Ndikong rural road project and 9.3-km Gongoshi rural road, under construction respectively in Mayo-Belwa and Yola South local government areas of the state. The projects are among several other rural roads awarded across the state by the Fintiri administration totaling about 300 kilometers. Speaking shortly after the inspection of the Ndikog road in Ngurore town in Yola South LGA, Governor Umaru Fintiri expressed the belief that the contractor handling the projects will meet the timeframe of 18 months. He said the intention was to conclude most of his projects by June this year before the rains become too much. Also speaking, the Manager of the firm handling the project, Mr. Lee Xinching disclosed that the Ndikong and Gongoshi rural road projects will be completed in the next two months.

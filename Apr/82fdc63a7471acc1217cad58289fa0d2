In response to the yearnings of the residents for food amidst lockdown of Lagos State, the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), has donated food and medical supplies to the Lagos State Government. The donation, according to LCCI, is part of its support to the State Government in mitigating the challenges of the Coronavirus (COVID- 19) pandemic and alleviating the economic hardship of the less-privilege in the state. The supplies, which include bags of rice, cartons of Noodles and cartons of alcohol-based hand sanitizers, were received on behalf of the Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwoolu by his Deputy Chief of Staff, Mr. Gboyega Soyanwo and Commissioner for Transport, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde. The LCCI President, Toki Mabogunje, said: “In view of the global outbreak of COVID-19 and the present challenging social, economic and public health realities, it has become imperative for us at LCCI as a socially responsible organisation to support the efforts of government in helping to cushion the effects of the pandemic on Lagos residents.” Mabogunje stressed that, “It is no longer news that the pandemic has disrupted and still disrupting business and economic activities across sectors. We commend the combined efforts of the Federal, Lagos and other States, and their Ministries and Agencies, notably, Lagos State Ministry of Health, Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and the Federal Ministry of Health for being front liners in the war against the pandemic.” He emphasized that “The business community will continue to support the governments at all levels to subdue the ravaging pandemic.”

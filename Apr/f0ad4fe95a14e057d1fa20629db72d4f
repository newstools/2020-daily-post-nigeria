Barcelona midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, could leave the club to join Chelsea at the end of the season. According to the Spanish newspaper, Sport, Chelsea is willing to sign the Brazilian international after he emerged as a top target at the West London club. The Blues are already discussing with Coutinho’s agent as they look to bolster the squad after they failed to sign any player last January transfer window. The Stamford Bridge club wants to make amends this summer by handing Lampard around £150million to spend on Coutinho and other new signings. Coutinho is presently on loan at Bayern Munich from Barcelona. The 27-year-old left Liverpool in January, 2018 for Barcelona. He is among the eight players Barcelona want to leave Camp Nou this coming summer transfer window amid the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak across the world. Meanwhile, Chelsea hero, Frank Leboeuf, has warned his former club against making a move for Coutinho. “Coutinho has been good with Liverpool, so far, poor with Barcelona and Bayern Munich,” Leboeuf told ESPN last month. “I’d have lots of question marks seeing him coming to Chelsea, to bring what? We have young players, very talented, who are very promising. “We have good midfield players with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho, to organize the game. I do not know where his place would be.”

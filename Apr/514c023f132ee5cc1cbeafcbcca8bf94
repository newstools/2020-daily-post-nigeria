Former Nigeria captain, Joseph Yobo, has named some of the toughest players he faced during his career. In an interview with ESPN, he listed Lionel Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Didier Drogba. Yobo faced an Argentina side with Messi three times and the South Americans were victorious on every occasion. “I would have said Robbie Keane the former Tottenham player, he was clever but it has to be Messi. “I am the kind of person that I like to see you because I can mark you and put you in my pocket. But sometimes because of the way these strikers move and their size they come from everywhere, sometimes they are missing in the game and the next thing they pop up and mess you around. “Messi I would say because the few times we played against him he made the difference and I was unable to get hold of him. “We already knew that he was going to be the problem, we knew that if we took him out we had a better chance. “Ronaldo because of his physique and his size, he plays as a number 9, it was easier for me to mark him but when I played against him he was more of a wide player,” Yobo said. When asked to name his toughest African opponent, Yobo replied: “For African striker I would say Didier Drogba, he had presence, he can head the ball and for some reason he ends up scoring important goals when it matters in my time with Everton.”

The Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) has produced two types of ventilators that could be quickly reproduced to stem the shortage of the equipment as the country battles coronavirus. Major Abubakar Abdullahi, NDA Public Relations Officer, announced this in a statement Friday night. Abdullahi noted that the NDA also produced hand wash and sanitisers to enhance hygiene and develop hand-washing hand culture within the Academy. The ventilators design and production came one week after the Commandant, Major General Jamil Sarham, convened a team of engineers, technologists and technicians from the Mechatronics Department, to “develop an affordable ventilator within the shortest possible time, using readily available components”. Presenting their report, the team leader, Major Abubakar Surajo Imam, disclosed that the medical equipment could be quickly deployed to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. Imam, who heads the Department of Mechatronics, explained that both ventilators, NDA Type 1 and NDA Type 2, could be reproduced cheaply and that the NDA has the capacity of producing 30 ventilators in a month. He said: “NDA Type 1 ventilator is a fully automated system with an interactive user-interface and 4 potentiometers for adjusting air and oxygen parameters. “NDA Type 2 is also fully automated, operating with a 2 KVA self-sustaining onboard inverter equipped with a military-grade lithium battery.” The officer added that the prototypes have been subjected to a series of technical performance evaluation tests with impressive results.

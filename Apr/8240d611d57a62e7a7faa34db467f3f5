Pope Francis has said the COVID-19 pandemic is nature’s response to humans ignoring the current ecological crises. The Pope made this statement at a time where there are debates on social media by pastors over relationship between COVID-19 pandemic, 5G network and the Antichrist. The Senior pastor of Believers Loveworld, Chris Oyakhilome, in a viral video had linked the Coronavirus and the 5G network to Antichrist. The Pontiff in an email interview published Wednesday in The Tablet and Commonwealth magazines, said the outbreak is an opportunity for humans to slow down the rate of production and consumption and learn to understand the natural world. “We did not respond to the partial catastrophes. Who now speaks of the fires in Australia, or remembers that 18 months ago a boat could cross the North Pole because the glaciers had all melted? Who speaks now of the floods? “I don’t know if Coronavirus pandemic is the revenge of nature, but they are certainly nature’s responses,” he added. The pandemic on Sunday made the Pope celebrate Palm Sunday mass in an empty church which was normally packed with tourists. The 83-year-old Pope, who has a damaged lung from an infection in his 20s, has tested negative for the novel coronavirus. Pope Francis added that he is praying even more from his residence in this time.

The Northern Youth Council of Nigeria, NYCN, says it has observed with dismay the apparent insincerity in federal governments’ style of distributing palliative measures in the wake of COVID-19 in the country. The group disclosed its observation in a press statement issued by its National President, Isah Abubakar. The NYCN said governments claim that it gave out over N50bn in less than three (3) days to about 2.5m people is entirely unacceptable and insincere. The group described the claims as the highest form of fraud ever witnessed in the country. The statement said, “It’s outrightly wrong for the government to have claimed that they have given out over 50 billion naira in less than 3 days to 2.5 million people, to us as a Council it is a scam at the highest level. “It is also obvious that Tinubu who is seen as a nationalist but has chosen only Lagos to benefit from his 200 million naira donations when he fully knows that only Lagos can not make him President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “Tinubu should rest assured that northerners are watching from afar and will never support his aspiration in the nearest future because we can not afford to mortgage the future of Nigerians just like what’s happening in Lagos.” The group called on the government to take a cue from the COVID-19 experience and the health sector challenges to upgrade the standard of medical facilities all over Nigeria.

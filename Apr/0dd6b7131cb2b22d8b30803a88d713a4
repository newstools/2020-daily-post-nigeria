Cross River State Governor, Prof Ben Ayade, has called on Muslim faithful in the state to use the period of Ramadan fast to offer prayers for the state and Nigeria in the effort to contain the spread of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Ayade, in a Ramadan message signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Christian Ita, enjoined all Ummah to continue to show love and care for one another, by being generous and serving humanity selflessly. The Governor assured the Muslim community in the state that his administration would continue to implement programmes, projects and policies that will bring greater development and improve the quality of lives of the people irrespective of their tribe and religion. He said appointing many Muslims into higher offices in his administration, including the Special Adviser on Muslim Affairs, was a deliberate policy to ensure inclusiveness. While appreciating the support and cooperation enjoyed from the Muslim community thus far, the Governor urged them to continue to observe the “No Mask No Movement” Order as well as the directive against large gatherings during prayers, especially Iftar and Tarawhee in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19 disease. “My administration’s determination to deepen religious freedom and freedom of association is one strategy that is working in Cross River State. “Our COVID-19 food Palliatives distribution includes Muslim households and I hope this will help during the Ramadan period and elevate the condition of the Ummah, especially the underprivileged and sustain the atmosphere of peaceful coexistence and religious harmony in Cross River State. “On behalf of the Government and people of Cross River State, I wish all the Muslim faithful Ramadan Kareem in the next Twenty Nine or Thirty days,” he said.

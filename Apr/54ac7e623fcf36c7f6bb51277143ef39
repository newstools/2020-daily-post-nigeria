One person has reportedly been killed in a clash between men of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) and suspected smugglers in Ogun State. DAILY POST reports that the incident occurred around 1pm on Saturday, while officers of the command were on routine anti-smuggling patrol along Iselu and Egua areas of Yewa North local government of the state. In a statement by the Customs Public Relations Officer, Ogun Area Command I, Abdullahi Maiwada on Sunday, it was reported that the officers came across a convoy of motorcycles, allegedly ferrying foreign parboiled rice along the bush paths of the communities. Maiwada disclosed that the suspected smugglers immediately launched an attack on the customs officers on sighting them; adding that they were attacked with assorted dangerous weapons. He revealed that the officers successfully repelled the attack, but one of the smugglers was shot dead, saying his corpse has since been deposited at the mortuary. The Customs PRO disclosed that the patrol team evacuated 44 bags of rice (50kg each) and two motorcycles abandoned by the smugglers. Maiwada expressed concerns that despite the Coronavirus lockdown, the suspected smugglers, who he said have no regards for law of the land or the disease ravaging the global community, resorted to crossing the border through illegal routes “to perpetuate their nefarious activities in total disregard of the health and economic well being of the country.” “Finally, the Command wishes to reiterate and warn the public against attack on Officers performing their lawful duty as such will leave the Officers with no other alternative than to defend themselves,” Maiwada warned.

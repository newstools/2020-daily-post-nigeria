I am stunned by this news. “This pandemic affects the Stade de Reims in its heart. He was a personality of Reims and a great professional in the sport. “He was with the club for more than 20 years and carried out his job with the utmost professionalism, in a passionate and even selfless manner. “Doctor Gonzalez, in the harshest periods of the club, worked on a voluntary basis. He is a precise doctor in his missions and an artist by his passions. “Today all my thoughts, those of the club, of which he will remain a strong figure, go to his wife and parents. “Today, it’s a drama that strikes us.”

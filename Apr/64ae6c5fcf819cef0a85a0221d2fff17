Former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Vincent Enyeama, has disclosed that he rejected offers from Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur because he was seeking regular playing time. According to Enyeama, both Premier League clubs wanted him as a second choice goalkeeper. The 37-year-old said he was keen on having regular playing time, and his snub made Arsenal to sign goalkeeper, David Ospina, who joined Napoli permanently last year after impressing on loan. “Arsenal wanted me as a second choice, but I was not interested,” Enyeama told ESPN. “I also had an offer from Tottenham Hotspur that wanted me as a second choice, and I was not interested. “It was after the 2006 AFCON and then again around the 2014 FIFA World Cup. When I turned them down, Arsenal now went on to sign David Ospina. “For me, I was at the stage where I preferred playing even if it was for one of the smallest clubs. “That’s what the agents that were involved told me, that Arsene Wenger wanted me at Arsenal, but he is not so sure because of my height and things like that. “People have their choices, and I respect their choices,” he said.

Ogu moved to Al-Adalah in Saudi Arabia as a free agent in January. Before his move, he was linked with the Premier League. In a tweet on Monday, Ogu has now hinted he would have loved to join Ndidi at Leicester City. “If am asked to choose between to give up my salary or play in the middle with Ndidi,I will give up my salary to play next to him in the middle. “Since he started playing for Eagles (Nigeria national team),all my best games with Eagles was when I had him middle with me,” he wrote. Ndidi replied the tweet, saying: Humbled bro, but collect you money oo.”

The Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, has slammed the Director General of the National Center for Disease Control, NCDC, Chikwe Ihekweazu, over his latest claims on Coronavirus. The group was reacting to Dr Ihekweazu’s speech on Channels Television on Thursday, where he declared that coronavirus will spread to all the 36 States in Nigeria. Chief Press Secretary of BNYL Richard Dianabasi Odung in a statement to DAILY POST on Friday rebuked the NCDC boss adding that “Ihekweazu, Buhari and all those in Aso Rock will be next to contract the disease.” BNYL wondered whether “the NCDC boss and the Minister of Health are immune to the virus.” The group noted that President Buhari and the NCDC boss do not wear face mask whereas NCDC has confirmed that the disease is a respiratory one. “NCDC boss is making money from the pandemic so he is praying for widespread of the virus,” the group alleged. “But their plans to get money from World Bank and UN relief support has failed already. “By the grace of God, he and those in Aso Rock rock will be in the next batch of confirmed cases of Coronavirus,” he said.

Popular Nigerian Singer and actor, Bankole Wellington, aka Banky W has criticized the decision of state governors to suspend lockdown in order to celebrate Easter. Some state governors on Thursday announced that the lockdown order will be relaxed in order for residents to celebrate Easter. This did not go down well with Banky W, as he wondered if the deadly virus cannot be contracted in churches and mosques. The 39-year-old singer expressed disappointment in the decision of the state governors. On his Twitter page, he wrote: “So for the State Governments that have suspended isolation and social distancing for Easter, do they have an agreement with the Coronavirus that it will also go on Easter break as well? “These our “leaders” sha. Kai.” DAILY POST reported that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State on Thursday relaxed lockdown order in the state for residents to observe religious gatherings during the Easter celebration. Also, Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma took the same decision in order to allow residents partake in Easter celebration despite increasing cases of Coronavirus in Nigeria.

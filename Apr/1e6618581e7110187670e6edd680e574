The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), on Monday, failed to announce two COVID-19 deaths in Kano State. DAILY POST had earlier on Monday reported that Kano State recorded two deaths. The State Ministry of Health confirmed this on Monday. Also, the NCDC had on Sunday announced that the total number of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in the country was 40. It reiterated the same figure on Monday. “As at 11:20pm April 27, 1,337 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported in Nigeria. “Discharged: 255, deaths: 40,” it wrote. However, the Kano State Ministry of Health had on Monday tweeted, “As at 12:15 pm, 27th April, 2020, @KanostateNg records an additional 2 deaths of COVID-19.” This means Nigeria’s death toll stands at 42 and not 40 as reported by the NCDC.

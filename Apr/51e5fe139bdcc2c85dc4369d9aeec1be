Bolaji Amusan, National President, Theatre Arts and Motion Pictures Practitioners Association of Nigeria (TAMPAN) says Funke Akindele’s arrest and prosecution was a lesson to everyone. Amusan, in a chat with NAN on Monday, described her as an outstanding and hardworking actress. He said it was unfortunate she had to face the music for violating government directives. Amusan, aka Mr Latin, advised Nigerians to remain law abiding. “She has never been of unruly behaviour, it is really painful for me, but there is nothing we can do, but to go in line with court ruling. “This should serve as a lesson to all. This is a play out of the rule of law, nobody is above and I hope Nigerians will learn from the entire scenario,” he said. The actress was taken into Police custody on Sunday for breaching the Lagos State social distancing order implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19. She and her husband, JJC Skillz, hosted an indoor party that had over 20 people at their home in Amen Estate, Ibeju-Lekki, Lagos. They were arraigned before a Lagos State Magistrate Court on Monday and were each fined N100,000. The Chief Magistrate, Yewande Aje-Afunwa, called their action “reckless” and ordered them to serve 14-day community service, among other sanctions.

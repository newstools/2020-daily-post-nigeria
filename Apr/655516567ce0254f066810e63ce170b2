Popular Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele, has explained why her husband, Abdul Rasheed Bello, Nigerian singer and producer, better known as JJC Skillz, celebrated his birthday, which led to social gathering amidst Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. DAILY POST had reported that Nigerians on social media have called on the Lagos State government to, with immediate effect, arrest Akindele and her husband. The couple defied both the state and the federal governments’ orders on Saturday, when they hosted an in-house party in celebration of JJC Skillz’s birthday. The party was crowded with popular faces such as Naira Marley and Eniola Badmus. The Lagos State Government had banned any gathering of more than twenty people, and President Muhammadu Buhari, a week ago shut down Abuja, Lagos, and the Ogun States completely over the increasing cases of Coronavirus. However, the orders could not stop Funke and her husband from gathering a crowd at their home in Lagos for the birthday party. Reacting to the development, Funke took to her official Instagram page on Sunday to apologize for her husband’s actions. “Dear Friends, I really have to do this!! I hear you all, and I acknowledge all your honest feedbacks,” she posted alongside a video. “I also thank you for your concerns—well wishes, and calls. I am sorry and hope this video offers some explanation. Please stay safe. And God bless. @lagosstategovt.” See the video below.   #COVID19lockdown: Funke Akindele Bello explains why husband held birthday party for her husband, #JJCSkillz with Naira Marley, others involved #FunkeAkindele #jjcskillz #Nollywood #Coronavirus #entertainmentindustry #nigeriancelebrities #ncdc #nigeriangovernment #coronavirusnigeria A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Apr 5, 2020 at 11:40am PDT

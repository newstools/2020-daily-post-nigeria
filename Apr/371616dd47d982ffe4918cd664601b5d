The Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, has placed some members of staff on mandatory leave with full benefits, pending the conclusion and outcome of the ongoing forensic audit. This is contained in a statement by NDDC Director of Corporate Affairs, Charles Odili and was obtained by DAILY POST. Odili stated that the action is based on the advice of the Lead Consultant on the Forensic Audit exercise, which has been accepted by the Interim Management Committee, IMC. The staff sent on mandatory leave fall into three categories and are those indicted by security agencies like the Police, ICPC and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for acts of impropriety and those whose acts are the subject of investigations by the forensic auditors. Also affected, â€œAre those who held key and sensitive positions in the commission during the period covered by the forensic audit and whose continued presence in the Commission will interfere, impair, undermine or compromise the objective forensic auditing of the affairs of the commission.

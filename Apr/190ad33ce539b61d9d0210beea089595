President Muhammadu Buhari has sent his best wishes to Muslims in the country and all over the world as they begin this year’s 30-day fast, following the sighting of the moon. Buhari described Ramadan 2020 “as a challenge, falling as it is in the period of the global pandemic” and cautioned Muslim faithful against congregating in mass. His message was contained in a statement Thursday night by his spokesman, Garba Shehu. “I congratulate all Muslims as they commence this year’s Ramadan fast which is depicted by self-denial, universal brotherhood, austerity and helping relatives and needy people,” he said. He lamented that the disease has spread to more than 200 nations, with virtually all countries affected and appealed citizens to avoid large gatherings and have their prayers and meals (suhoor and iftar) individually or with family at home. “In this Ramadan period, the kind of socializing you are used to now risks spreading the Coronavirus,” the President cautioned Muslims. The Nigerian leader enjoined them to refrain from those Ramadan rituals and traditions such as group meals and congregational prayers that have been put on hold by Muslim religious authorities all over the world. He urged Muslims to endure and not to use the coronavirus as an excuse not to participate in the Ramadan fast, unless such abstention is warranted by the excuses clearly outlined by health and religious authorities. The president wishes Muslims in the country and the world over all the blessings of the holy month.

The COVID-19 death toll has crossed 60,000 in the United States of America. Johns Hopkins University confirmed this on Wednesday. New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo, said that the death rate has declined in recent days but was still high. On Tuesday, no fewer than 330 people died across the State, which has been the U.S. epicentre. Cuomo stated that the figure was down from 335 and 337 the previous days. “You see the decline has been slow at best, and still disgustingly high,” Cuomo said at a briefing. Cuomo is set to sign an executive order to allow hospitals in some counties resume elective surgeries. The governor, like his colleagues nationwide, has announced a multi-phased approach to reopening. New York ‘stay-at-home’ order will expire on May 15, but could be extended. Most of the deaths in America have been in New York City, where police broke up a massive funeral in Brooklyn for a rabbi. Thousands Orthodox Jewish community members attended, a gathering New York Mayor Bill de Blasio condemned. “When I heard, I went there myself to ensure the crowd was dispersed. And what I saw WILL NOT be tolerated so long as we are fighting the coronavirus,” he said on Twitter.

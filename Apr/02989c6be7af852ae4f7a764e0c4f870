The outspoken Nigerian pastor, Adewale Giwa has blasted the Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere for asking Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to reverse his directive that Christians be allowed to converge in churches on Sunday to commemorate Easter. Giwa, who is the senior pastor in charge of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ, described Afenifere’s statement as insulting and disappointing. Recall that on Wednesday, Governor Akeredolu had given Christians waiver to commemorate the day while emphasizing that Easter is of huge importance in Christendom. But Afenifere sees Akeredolu’s decision as succumbing to blackmail from religious leaders who should know better. Reacting in a statement to DAILY POST on Thursday, Giwa urged the group to find something else to react to if they had lost direction. He said,” They are a bunch of hypocrites who only fight for their pockets. Are they still representing Yoruba? “They should find something else to react to in case they have lost direction. “This group has stopped functioning and representing the Yoruba community since the death of Chief Bola Ige. “Did the Christian leaders blackmail the Kogi State governor who lifted the ban on religious gatherings too? “Afenifere has lost touch with reality. Besides, Ondo State is not part of the states where some people can use Coronavirus to make money.”

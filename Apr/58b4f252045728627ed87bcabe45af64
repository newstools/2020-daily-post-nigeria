Manchester United will be forced to pay Alexis Sanchez a £1.1million loyalty bonus, upon his return from Inter Milan, the UK Sun reports. Sanchez is currently on loan at the Serie A club, after enduring a miserable spell at Old Trafford since his move from Arsenal. The Chilean attacker is on a massive £400,000-per-week with United, who are paying part of his wages while he is with Inter. However, the Red Devils were hoping the Nerrazurri would make the move permanent. But Inter boss, Antonio Conte, does not want to keep Sanchez due to his poor form. Sanchez’s return to United will activate a clause in his initial contract, with the 31-year-old entitled to the seven-figure bonus in July.

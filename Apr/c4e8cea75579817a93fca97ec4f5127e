The Police in Ebonyi State have arrested a gang for allegedly killing a police officer attached to a Chinese mining company in the state. The arrest was contained in a statement on Friday by DSP Loveth Odah, Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO). He disclosed that the deceased officer’s AK-47 rifle was also recovered. The spokesperson said on April 25, the Site Manager of Tongyl Mining Company, Mkpumakwuokuko Izzi LGA of Ebonyi, Joel Osaghele, reported that a youth gang from the area attacked them. Osaghele, who was in the company of a Chinese national, reported that the gang attacked them alongside three mobile police escorts, as they were moving the company’s property from the site to Abakaliki. He said that the gang led by one Ikechukwu Okanga, used logs to barricade the road at ‘four-corner junction’ and that it took the intervention of the village head, Sunday Nwamini for the company’s vehicles to pass. The PPRO said that the youths re-grouped and ambushed the company’s vehicles at ‘Opefia’ junction and attacked the mobile policemen. “They snatched the AK-47 rifle of Sgt. John Edeh, F/No: 442470, attached to 32 Police Mobile Force (PMF) Abakaliki, beat and stabbed him several times before shooting him in the head. The Divisional Police Officers in the area mobilized and led a team to the scene where the two other mobile policemen were rescued. “The victim was rushed to the Alex-Ekwueme Federal Teaching Hospital Abakaliki (AE-FETHA) for treatment but was later confirmed dead by a doctor. The Commissioner of Police, Awosola Awotinde, has ordered a full-scale investigation into the matter to unravel the circumstances behind the attack,” the PPRO added.

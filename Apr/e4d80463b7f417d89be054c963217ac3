Liverpool are set to make a world-record of £250 million bid for Kylian Mbappe, if Sadio Mane signs for Real Madrid, according to the UK Sun. Mane is high on Real’s transfer wishlist and Zinedine Zidane is determined to get the Senegalese forward in the summer window. The 28-year-old only put pen to paper on new terms with the Reds just 18 months ago. Mane signed a deal worth £150,000-a-week, which will keep him on Merseyside until 2023. However, his representatives have been approached, about a possible transfer away from Anfield. Mane is expected to snub Los Blancos, but should the Spanish giants tempt him, Liverpool will move quickly to replace him with Mbappe.

Former Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar, has called for a review of hazard allowance for healthcare workers in the country as Nigeria continues to fight coronavirus. Atiku, on his Twitter page said a review of hazard allowance was necessary at a time when the health workers were battling in the frontline to fight against COVID-19. His tweet read: “Having acknowledged that healthcare workers in the frontline of the war against #COVID19 are our true heroes, a review that will enhance their hazard allowance should be given immediate consideration. “ His call might not be unconnected to a statement by the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, admitting that he had no knowledge if doctors and other health practitioners tackling COVID-19 were paid hazard allowances. Ehanire, who met with the National Assembly leadership in Abuja on Thursday, claimed that what the doctors are doing is routine. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, had asked the minister on Thursday if the health workers handling Coronavirus cases were paid any hazard allowance. But, Ehanire responding said: “I am not aware of it. “It is the standard job they do every day.”

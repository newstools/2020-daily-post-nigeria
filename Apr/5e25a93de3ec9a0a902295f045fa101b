The Chief Judge of Ogun State, Justice Mosunmola Dipeolu, said she has ordered the release of 249 inmates from five Correctional Centres across the state. The Chief Judge said those who were released included men and women with cases ranging from stealing, burglary, assault to bodily harm and other minor cases. Dipeolu disclosed that the release of the inmates was based on the Federal Government’s decision to decongest correctional centres so as to contain the spread of Covid-19. According to the Chief Judge, 48 inmates were freed in Ijebu-Ode; 41 in Sagamu; seven in Ago farm settlement, near Ijebu-Ode; 54 in Ibara; 32 in Oba, while 67 others were released at Ilaro Correctional Centres respectively. She maintained that the decongestion would improve social distancing measures, thereby reducing the spread of the virus at the correctional centres. In her advice, the CJ urged the released inmates to go back to the society and be useful for the entire nation and refrain from sinful acts. She added that those being considered were those having little years to complete their jail terms; those with old age; those that have not paid up their fines; those that have spent 50 percent of their jail terms and those on medical related matters.

The Lagos State Government on Tuesday said a total of 119 people have been identified with symptoms of COVID-19 in the state. Prof. Akin Abayomi said the people were identified during the house-to-house search of infected people. Speaking at a media briefing in the state, Abayomi disclosed that a total of 118,000 households have been reached. He also stated that tests are being conducted to determine their status. “We’ve embarked on an active case search in communities. The idea is to go to hot spots and go from door to door with our health personnel. So far, in the last two days, we’ve visited 118,000 households and we’re looking for the typical symptoms of COVID-19. We’ve identified about 119 people who have the symptoms that are suggestive of COVID-19. “But let me remind you that COVID is one of the viruses that can cause respiratory symptoms. There are many viruses. So, the idea is to take samples from these 119 and analyse them and that would give us an idea of how much COVID-19 activity is happening in the communities,” he said.

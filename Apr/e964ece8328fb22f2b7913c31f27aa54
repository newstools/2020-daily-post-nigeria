Zhou Pingjian, Ambassador of the People’s Republic of China to Nigeria, has said that the 15-man COVID-19 medical team that arrived in Nigeria on Wednesday, came to reciprocate the gestures demonstrated by Nigeria during China’s trying times in fighting Coronavirus. He also said that the COVID-19 medical experts are expected to stay in Nigeria for a month. Pingjian said this while speaking to newsmen at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Wednesday afternoon after a chartered Air Peace aircraft arrived with the doctors and medical supplies. “We received the support of all means from Nigeria, and it is time for us to reciprocate the friendship and kindness,” Pingjian said. “We appreciate the support from the Minister of Health and the Government. “We want to share the China experience and see what we can do for Nigeria. “The Government, trans-business, private, public, and what we are trying to do is to address the concern of the Nigerians friends.” He added, “Preliminarily, I think the Chinese doctors have a month to stay in Nigeria. “As the Minister assured Nigerians, the doctors for the first two weeks will put themselves in self-quarantine, though they can work through video conferencing.” Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria is 276, according to NCDC.

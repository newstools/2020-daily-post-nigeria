Property and equipment worth millions of Naira were on Saturday destroyed when an online radio station, Agidigbo Radio, went up in flames. The online radio station which belongs to an Ibadan based radio presenter, Alhaji Oriyomi Hamzat is located along the Iwo-Ibadan Road in Monatan area of Ibadan. DAILY POST gathered that the incident which drew hundreds of residents, also caused a stir as people ran over fear of the fire spreading to other buildings in the area. Director, Oyo State Fire Service, Moshood Adewuyi, confirmed the incident. He said the fire station was alerted around 11 am. He said that firemen were mobilized to the scene following a distress call by residents of the community in the early hours of Saturday. Adewuyi said, “It is true that the studio of the online radio station caught fire this morning; the place was locked when our men arrived the scene. “None of the workers of the radio station was around at the time of the outbreak. You know, a studio is always padded with foam. That aggravated the fire. “We cannot quantify that. The transmitter; the studio equipment; and office materials at the station were damaged by the inferno. The people around there alerted us around 11am. One man was electrocuted. But, thank God, it was not much. “What happened was that as soon as our men arrived at the scene, we directed our control room to instruct the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company to cut power supply to the area. “Without getting supply from us, they restored power supply to the area. Majority of the people were already wet, and you know, water is a conductor of electricity. But thank God, there was no casualty.”

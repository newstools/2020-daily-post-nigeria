Leicester City striker, Kelechi Iheanacho, may leave the club to join John Mikel Obi’s former club, Trabzonspor. According to Turkish outlet, Fotospor, Trabzonspor wants Iheanacho to join the club this summer transfer window after terminating Mikel Obi’s contract in March when the former Super Eagles captain refused to play amid the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The newspaper reports that the Turkish giants are set to lose their striker, Alexander Solorth, who has been linked with a move to Liverpool and has identified Iheanacho as one of the potential options to replace him. Iheanacho has spent his entire senior career in England, but it may be time for him to move to another country as Trabzonspor are keen on his services. He has rediscovered his scoring form so far this season, netting eight goals and providing four assists in 18 appearances across all competitions for Leicester City. The 23-year-old joined the Foxes for €27.7 million in 2017 from Manchester City. The Nigerian international is seen as the long-term replacement for England striker, Jamie Vardy, at Leicester. Iheanacho is valued at €12million by Transfermarkt and Trabzonspor will still have to break their transfer record of €6.2million paid for Gökhan Ünal over a decade ago to lure him to Turkey.

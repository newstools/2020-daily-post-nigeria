The Federal Government of Nigeria was on Wednesday told to look into the assaults and humiliations allegedly meted on Nigerians living in China by the Chinese Police. The Managing Director of Good Time Paint and Allied Products Industry Limited, Prince Mendy Archibong, made the call in reaction to a video and news report which trended on social media on Tuesday, where Chinese police were seen chasing Nigerians out from their lodge to the road, telling them to go back to their country. Archibong said the action seen in the four minutes and 43 seconds video was not just humiliating but embarrassing. Nigerians in the video were heard saying, “They are chasing us. They are telling us to go back to our country. There are Chinese in Africa. They have not been sent packing. “They kept us here for 14 days, now they are telling us to leave. ” Those who were chased by the Chinese police in the video were heard speaking Igbo language. Archibong said while the federal government is working on bringing back Nigerians abroad due to the Coronavirus pandemic, it will also be important to take note of human rights violations against her citizens abroad. “Nigerians have contributed greatly to the growth of the Chinese economy. China and Nigeria have done businesses together, so one would expect a trickle down mutual respect between nationals of both countries.” “The video wherein those Nigerians are being chased out by Chinese police debases the dignity of Nigerians in China. It does not look good at all. I feel if those Nigerians had done anything bad, there are more dignified, legal and diplomatic ways to address it.” “I call on President Muhammadu Buhari, the foreign affairs minister and the Nigerian commission in China to cause an inquiry into the action.” He said. Archibong also called on the Chinese High Commission to investigate why Nigerians were assaulted and treated with disdain by the Chinese police.

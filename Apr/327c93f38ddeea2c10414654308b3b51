The International Press Center, IPC, has called for the immediate release of Kufre Carter, a sports presenter with XL 106.9 FM in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State. According to reports, Carter is allegedly being detained by the Department of State Services over a leaked telephone conversation he had with a medical doctor on the method deployed by the Akwa Ibom State government in handling the spread of dreaded COVID-19 pandemic in the state. Lanre Arogundade, Director, IPC in a statement made available to DAILY POST, described the detention as a gross violation of Carter’s rights, the Nigerian laws and all democratic tenets. “The recurring developments underscore the remarkable fact that even after twenty years of ceaseless democracy, the government can still create subtle censorships to muzzle journalists and other independent voices at the faintest criticism,” Mr. Arogundade lamented. While calling for the unconditional release of the detained journalist, IPC stated that it had become pertinent to put ‘an end to all forms of impunity against the media.’
The DSS is yet to react to the reports.

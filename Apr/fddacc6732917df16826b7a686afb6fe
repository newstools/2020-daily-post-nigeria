President Muhammadu Buhari has accepted the passing away of his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, as the will of God. This was revealed by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Mallam Garba Shehu, while speaking at Kyari’s graveside on Saturday. Kyari died on Friday after battling with COVID-19 complications. He has since been buried in Abuja according to Islamic rites and passages. “These are not things that we have a choice in, it’s providence, it’s God who says who goes and who stays. “The President, obviously a deeply religious person, takes it that it cannot be helped. At the end of the day, all of us will also go that way,” Shehu said. Shehu went on to extol Kyari for his leadership in President Buhari’s administration and described him as “a pillar” in the presidency.

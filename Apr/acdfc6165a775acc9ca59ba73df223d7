The Federal Government has confirmed that Nigeria is “migrating to community transmission” of coronavirus. Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, said this on Wednesday at the National Polio Emergency Operations Centre in Abuja. He addressed the participants at the ongoing National Training of Trainers (NTOT). The minister also announced the training of Primary Health Care workers on the requisite knowledge required of them to contribute to checking the spread of the coronavirus in the country. Ehanire said that the training was to sharpen the preparedness of PHCs and their response to the coronavirus pandemic. “As we migrate to the community transmission phase, it has become imperative to train and sensitise our primary healthcare workers, who are the first point of call and contact by clients in our communities. “The PHC workers manning the facilities are strategically positioned to contribute to the decisive actions required to curb this scourge,” Ehanire noted.

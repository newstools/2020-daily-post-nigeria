Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov has disagreed with former teammate Rio Ferdinand after the ex-England defender called for the cancellation of the 2019/2020 Premier League season due to the Coronavirus pandemic. DAILY POST recalls that Ferdinand had claimed last week that Liverpool should miss out on winning the Premier League, as the world continues to battle with the COVID-19 outbreak. Ferdinand, said: “I think the Premier League should be voided. “I know there are going to be many Liverpool fans who will say; ‘oh, Rio, just because you used to play for Man United, but this is about life and death situations, about society in the broader grand scheme of things. “I just do not see a way that can be done where health is not compromised.” Reacting to the development, Berbatov believes Liverpool fully deserves to win the Premier League title after a superb start to the campaign, adding that it would be ‘unfair’ if the season is voided. Liverpool has 25 points lead ahead of second-place Manchester City with nine matches remaining before the English top-flight league was suspended indefinitely due to the spread of Coronavirus world-wide. “People are suggesting to hand the Premier League title to Liverpool, and honestly they deserve it the way they had been playing, nobody was going to catch them,” Berbatov told Betfair. “With the way they play their games, the football they produced, and how far they are in front, they fully deserve the title this season. “It is so strange, and it will be unfair on Liverpool if the season is voided, they will be so disappointed.”

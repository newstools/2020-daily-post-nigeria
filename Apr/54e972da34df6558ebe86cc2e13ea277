The 2019/2020 season in Holland has been cancelled due to the coronavirus outbreak. Leaders Ajax have been denied the league title and no team has been relegated from the Eredivisie or promoted from the second tier. This comes days after the Dutch government extended a ban on major public events by three months on Tuesday. Ajax were on top, level on 56 points with AZ Alkmaar but ahead on goal difference. “Unfortunately, with the cabinet’s most recent coronavirus measures, it has become impossible to play out the 2019-2020 season of professional football leagues in time. “It will be crystal clear to everyone involved, from supporters and players to directors and referees, that public health always comes first; the decisions made today about the settlement of the running competitions are only a football problem in the perspective of what the coronavirus causes in society,” Part of a Dutch Football Association statement read.

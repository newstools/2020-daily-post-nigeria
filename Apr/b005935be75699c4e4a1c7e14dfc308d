The Nasarawa State Police Command says it has arrested 18 suspects over an alleged connection with the kidnap of three persons in different parts of the state. The state Police Commissioner, Mr Bola Longe, disclosed this in an interview with newsmen on Sunday in Lafia. He said there had not been any case of kidnapping in the state for a long time except recently when three persons were kidnapped in different locations in the state. Longe said all three victims were rescued alive, while the suspects were apprehended for allegedly being responsible for their abduction. He said,” Two of the suspects sustained injuries in the course of the arrest, as they engaged the police and tried to resist arrest. “The suspects are helping us with useful information that will lead to the arrest of other members of the gang. “We recovered a lot of things from them, including over N1 million cash and other materials. “We will charge them to court as soon as investigations are concluded.” Longe assured the people of the state that the police were battle-ready for the criminal elements in the state. He advised members of the public to always provide the police with useful information about the activities of criminals to enable them to sanitise the state.

The English Premier League, EPL, on Friday, provided a resumption date update after discussions with 20 club members as Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic continues to disrupt sporting events globally. The EPL clubs debated possible scheduling models to finish the 2019/2020 season in full, with 92 fixtures still left to be played. All 20 clubs were represented on a video call as the English top-flight league reaffirmed their commitment to completing the current campaign. DAILY POST had reported that the Premier League is suspended indefinitely due to the spread of Coronavirus across the world. A Premier League statement read: “We are acutely aware of the distress COVID-19 is causing, and our thoughts are with all those directly affected by the pandemic. “In common with other businesses and industries, the Premier League and our clubs are working through complex planning scenarios. “We are actively engaging with stakeholders, including broadcast partners, and we aim to ensure we are in a position to resume playing when it is safe to do so and with the full support of the government. “The health and well-being of players, coaches, managers, club staff, and supporters are our priority, and the league will only restart when medical guidance allows. “Today’s shareholders’ meeting provided an opportunity to discuss possible scheduling models. “It remains our objective to complete the 2019-20 season, but at this stage, all dates are tentative while the impact of (Coronavirus) COVID-19 develops. “In response to the pandemic, the PL, our clubs and players have provided vital support for communities and the NHS and will continue to do so after matches recommence.”

Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has admitted he is “hurt” by being away from his players during the coronavirus shutdown. The Reds are using modern-day technology as they train remotely. The Premier League leaders use a variety of workouts hosted via video link, to bring the squad and staff together. “It’s getting worse, the longer it takes. I accept the situation 100 per cent like it is but the longer you don’t see somebody you like, the more it hurts. “That’s the situation we are in at the moment,” Klopp told the club website. Liverpool are currently 25 points clear of Manchester City and are looking to win the title for the first time in 30 years.

UEFA has given European football leagues, including Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and Bundesliga a one-month notice ending May 25 to inform the European governing body of their plans to restart their domestic competitions. DAILY POST recalls that the Premier League and all other major European football leagues were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic across the globe. But UEFA is keen to start planning for next season’s European club tournaments. In a letter to the 55 federations in UEFA on Tuesday, UEFA President, Aleksander Ceferin, wrote that any league cancelling its season would need to produce a list of teams that have qualified for European club competitions, also by May 25 deadline. “National Associations or Leagues should be in a position to communicate to UEFA by May 25, 2020, the planned restart of their domestic competitions including the date of resumption and the relevant competition format. “If a domestic competition is to be prematurely terminated for legitimate reasons, UEFA would require the National Association to explain by May 25, 2020, the special circumstances justifying such premature termination and to select clubs for the UEFA club competitions 2020/21 based on sporting merit in the 2019/20 domestic competitions,” Ceferin wrote.

The Zamfara State Police Command has said that in line with the Federal Government’s directives banning all mining activities across the country and the mandate given to the security agents to enforce the order, two suspected illegal miners have been arrested in Bukkuyum Local Government area of the state. The command said State Commissioner of Police, Barrister Usman Nagogo, led a Special Task Force team to Kwali mining sites where the suspects were nabbed. According to the command’s Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO), SP Mohammed Shehu, the mining sites were raided following an intelligence report that illegal miners were still operating at the site despite several warnings by the Police Command. Shehu said that two labourers, Hamisu Umar and Dahiru Mohammed were arrested at the site, stressing that others escaped into the forest. “One of the suspects, Hamisu Umar confirmed the presence of foreign nationals such as Chinese, Koreans and Burkinabe working in collaboration with some Nigerians,” he said. “But they were not met during the raid Operation today. Meanwhile, the suspects are assisting the police with vital information that could lead to arrest of their leaders. “Some of the tools used for the illegal mining were recovered as exhibits.” The police spokesman further explained that a combined team of mobile policemen and Counter Terrorism Unit have been deployed to take over the site to forestall further illegal mining activities. He added that the Commissioner of Police, Barrister Usman Nagogi, has, therefore, called on members of the general public to obey government directives, pointing out that anybody who goes contrary to the laws of the land will be dealt with squarely.

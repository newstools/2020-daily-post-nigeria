Chelsea midfielder, Billy Gilmour, has named Manchester United’s Scott McTominay, as the most difficult player he has come across in his fledgling career so far. Gilmour has been impressive for Chelsea since he broke into manager Frank Lampard’s first-team squad. Asked to name the “most difficult” player he’s faced since joining Chelsea, Gilmour told Live Twitch stream: “In a game, I would say Scott McTominay, not just because he is Scottish, it was just in that game I found it very difficult. “There is no rivalry; I do not know him that well. But after the match, he did text me and said, ‘keep doing what you’re doing.’ I thought that was really nice of him.” Gilmour had made three Premier League appearances for Chelsea so far this season before the English top-flight league was suspended indefinitely due to the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world. The 18-year-old, who joined Chelsea from Rangers in 2017, won the Man of the Match performances against Liverpool in the FA Cup and Everton in the Premier League.

A civil rights advocacy group, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari, the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu and the heads of other security forces, to put a permanent stop to the persistent killings in Kaduna, Benue, and Delta States. HURIWA, a prominent rights group, said Kaduna and Delta States government, in collaboration with Buhari and security agencies should put a stop to the incessant attacks resulting into wanton destruction of lives, properties and kidnapping of defenceless civilians for ransom in some parts of the States. The rights group expressed shock and consternation as to why communities still come under armed terrorist attacks despite a statewide lockdown imposed to help contain the spread of COVID-19 in virtually the entire federation. A statement by HURIWA’s National Coordinator, Comrade Emmanuel Onwubiko, and the National Media Affairs Director, Miss Zainab Yusuf said it was disturbing and disheartening to note that at a time when the masses are passing through difficulties due to the COVID-19 lockdown, “armed terrorists continue to attack them in their houses with little or no resistance from the security forces statutorily empowered and funded to protect the citizens. “The ease with which terrorists, armed marauders, armed Fulani herdsmen operate in Southern Kaduna and parts of Delta State and the devastation they unleashed in those communities without ever being caught by the security forces goes to show that there are fifth columnists embedded within the Nigerian Security forces or government that provide logistics; funding support and protection to these armed marauders who have left dozens of innocent citizens maimed, killed and several communities burnt just like some communities that have just been sent on fire in Benue State by suspected armed Fulani herdsmen and unfortunately the Chief security officer of Benue and the governor lacks the capacity to stop the killings but has asked the citizens to begin a week-long fasting”. HURIWA said it was unexplainable how the terrorists had access to communities with ease carrying assault rifles while law abiding citizens were forced to stay at home. The rights group affirmed that it was aware of thoroughly documented information from dependable sources regarding how some communities have been attacked, lives lost and properties destroyed in the past one week in Kaduna State. It said “these incessant killings of Christians have demonstrated an unambiguous evidence of coordinated genocides.” The rights group said the International community must step up measures to compel the Nigerian state to halt these cocktails of suspected state sponsored terrorism.

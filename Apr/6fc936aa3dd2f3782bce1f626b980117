Jigawa State Government has suspended performing of Ittikaf and Tuhajjud (voluntary night prayer and private devotion) in the coming month of Ramadan to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar disclosed this after meeting with stakeholders at Sir Ahmadu Bello Hall in Dutse. He said the meeting is aimed at reviewing some of the strategies adopted and see how best to protect the citizens against coronavirus. He explained that some of the decisions included banning of Itikaf and Tuhajjud in the coming month of Ramadan and observation of social distancing in Juma’at prayer and use of face masks. “We agreed that there will be Friday prayer but two metres social distancing must be observed, washing of hands before entering mosques and wearing of face masks to see the level of compliance. “We are also looking for the possibilities of allowing Ramadan Tafsir and Tarawiy but it depends on the level of compliance. “Our traditional rulers will also participate in protecting our borders and report anybody who sneaks into the state for possible action.” Badaru noted that a mobile court would also be constituted to punish those who violated all the directives given by the state Task Force on COVID-19.

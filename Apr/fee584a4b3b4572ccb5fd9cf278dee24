The prices of foodstuffs in some markets in Cross River State have skyrocketed following the coronavirus pandemic in Nigeria. DAILY POST reporter, who monitored the prices of foodstuffs in various markets in the state, observed that the prices of staple foods including garri, rice, beans and others have increased geometrically. A four 7cm cup of garri goes for N200 as against N80, rice is now N130 per cup as against N80-N90, groundnut is sold at N100 as against N50, crayfish now goes for N35, 000 a bag as against N18, 000 while prices of fish also increased geometrically. A stick of fish that normally goes for N1, 000 now is sold at N2, 000, while palm oil goes for N300 a bottle as against N200. The prices of beverages and other products have also skyrocketed. Speaking with our reporter, a resident, Mrs. Iniobong Okon, blamed the increase in prices of foodstuffs on closure of roads and borders. “Traders are now selling those old consumables and staple foodstuffs they had before now. “The closure of roads and borders did not allow traders to bring in food items. This affects civil servants a lot as most of them are not farmers and those who would love to farm have no place to farm,” she decried. She also lamented that those on essential duties were paying double transportation fare to their various places of work, “A drop is now N100 as against N50. We plead with the government to ensure that palliative measures are extended to essential workers,” she added.

Newcastle United legend, Alan Shearer, has handed a list of three players to Manchester United to sign. Shearer wants Man United to make a move for Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho, Tottenham’s Harry Kane, and Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish this summer transfer window. According to him, Sancho, Kane, and Grealish are exactly the types of players the Red Devils manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, needs at Old Trafford to return the club to its former glory. “With their financial clout, Manchester United are in a good position to take advantage in future transfer markets once football is eventually back,” Shearer said in his column for The Sun. “To get anywhere near where they want to be, then they need three, possibly four, big signings. “I understand the talk of Jadon Sancho, I understand the talk of Harry Kane, and I certainly understand the talk of Jack Grealish. “Those three are exactly the types they need if they are to compete at the top again.” Meanwhile, the Premier League is currently suspended indefinitely due to the spread of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) across the globe.

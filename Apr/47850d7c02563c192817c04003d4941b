Popular Singer, Burna Boy has faulted the prosecution and conviction of Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele popularly known as “Jenifa” and her husband, JJC Skillz. Burna Boy said Nigerians will suffer if they fail to use the same energy in clamouring for Funke Akindele’s arrest to clamour for the arrest of corrupt politicians. The Nollywood actress and producer was arrested and arraigned on Monday by the Lagos State Police Command. Akindele was arraigned on a one-count criminal charge of flouting the Social Distance Directive contrary to Regulations 8 and 17 of the Lagos State Infectious Disease Regulations, 2020. Following their arraignment, both Akindele and her husband pleaded guilty to the charge.

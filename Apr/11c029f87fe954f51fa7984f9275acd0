Chelsea could become the first Premier League squad to take a voluntary pay cut, the UK Sun reports. It is understood the players agreed to a slash in their wages, in a group WhatsApp chat with skipper Cesar Azpilicueta. Despite extensive talks between top flight clubs and players, no team has so far agreed to a pay cut, to ease financial difficulties during the coronavirus crisis. For Arsenal, their squad is believed to be close to an agreement over a 12.5% reduction, after head coach Mikel Arteta intervened to convince the players. However, Chelsea may be further down the line in announcing their pay cuts, after the squad collectively agreed to take a Â£10million hit over the next four months. The reduction represents a 10% pay cut and will kick in from next month, with the players agreeing for it to remain in place until the start of the new season.

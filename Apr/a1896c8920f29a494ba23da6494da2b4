Barcelona are looking to strike a part-exchange deal for Neymar, that would see Antoine Griezmann move to Paris Saint-Germain this summer. The Spanish giants are ready to let Griezmann leave after just one season, to help fund the signings of Neymar and Lautaro Martinez from Inter Milan. Barca value the France forward at €100m and will look to sell him to another club, if neither the player nor PSG want to do a deal. PSG reportedly value Neymar at €150m. With the COVID-19 outbreak, expensive transfers like these are looking increasingly unlikely. Even the richest clubs in Europe are counting the cost of their operations being postponed amid the pandemic. Barca captain, Lionel Messi, announced last week that he and his team-mates had agreed to take a 70% pay cut to help secure the club’s financial stability through the coronavirus outbreak.

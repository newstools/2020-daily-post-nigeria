Popular gospel artist, Sinach and her husband, Joe Egbu have slammed pastors who have allegedly relegated their faith in God due to science teachings amid the Coronavirus outbreak. Joe Egbu in a statement on his Instagram page expressed sadness over men of God who ignored the true healing in the power of God and have now chosen to stay away from church as science advised. According to him, “It’s a shame that church, known for healing is now regarded as a place to avoid.” He stressed that pastors have now become like their sheep by waiting for solutions to COVID-19. Supporting his post, his wife Sinach also shared his statement on her verified Instagram page. Alongside the post, she wrote that the gates of Hell will not prevail over the church. Joe wrote: “It’s a shame that Faith in God and Wisdom of God have been relegated in our society. “People of God rely more on Science ( Inventions) than God (Inventor). “Some men of God now seek counsels from the people of the World (I thought reverse was the case). They have relinquished their authorities and churches have become gathering of convenience. “They have become sheep like their congregation, cowardly waiting for any shepherd to proffer solution. It’s a shame that church, known for healing, is now regarded as a place to avoid.”

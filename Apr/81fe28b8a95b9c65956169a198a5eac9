The Minister of the FCT, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello, has urged Christians in the territory to use the occasion of the celebration of Easter to pray fervently for the end of the Coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic, which has so far claimed thousands of lives across the world. Malam Bello, made this remark in Abuja on Saturday, in a statement issued by Chief Press Secretary, Anthony Ogunleye. The Minister said that history has shown that when people turn to God in true supplication, in times of distress, the Almighty indeed answers prayers. According to him, Easter, as one of the holiest celebrations for Christians provided a great opportunity to pray to God to heal the sick and prevent a further spread of the disease across the Territory. Malam Bello equally encouraged residents to use the Easter celebrations to imbibe the spirit of unity which the FCT symbolizes. He said: “I urge you to use this season to reflect on the significance of the FCT as the Center of Unity of our country. This is the season to show true neighborliness and reach out to the needy and the less privileged who have been impacted negatively by COVID 19. “The disease is such that it does not discriminate between the haves and the haves not and has no respect for age or religious beliefs. We must therefore come together as communities to fight it together. “The best way to beat this disease is not to contract it. This is one time where prevention is most certainly better than cure. You must therefore be disciplined and maintain personal hygiene by observing to the letter, prevention protocols of constant hand washing, use of alcohol based sanitizers and observance of social distancing.” Malam Bello also asked residents to observe the stay-at-home directives of the government saying that it was the one way to curtail the spread of the virus and allow for contact tracing by the health authorities. Meanwhile, the number of Coronavirus cases in Nigeria is 305, according to NCDC.

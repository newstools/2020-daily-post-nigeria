Barcelona have rejected the chance to sign Willian, who has been offered to them, according to Sport. Willianâ€™s current deal at Chelsea is running out and he will be a free agent at the end of this season. The 31-year-old is widely expected to leave Stamford Bridge, with no progress made on an extension. With Barcelona turning down the chance to sign Willian, it appears Paris Saint-Germain or Tottenham are now more likely options. The Brazilian who joined from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013, has already admitted that his preference is to remain in the Premier League. He has made over 300 appearances for the Blues, winning two Premier League titles, the Europa League and FA Cup.

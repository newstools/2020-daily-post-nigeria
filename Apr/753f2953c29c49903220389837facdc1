The British High Commission has assured that 900 of its nationals stranded in Nigeria will be flown home on three flights chartered by its government. This was contained in a statement released on Friday. The commission said the three additional flights would bring the number of people flown back to the UK from Nigeria on government charter flights to about 2,000. The new flights are scheduled to take off on April 28: Abuja – London, May 1: Lagos – London and May 5: Lagos – London. “Our next phase of UK Government charter flights will mean another 900 British travellers are able to return home from Nigeria. “We appreciate the country’s effort as this has been a difficult time and we will continue to work closely with the Nigerian authorities to support those wishing to return to the UK,” James Duddridge, British minister of state for Africa, said. The British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing, advised the travellers to visit the Nigeria travel advice pages for further information.

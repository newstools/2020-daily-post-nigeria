British scientist, Sarah Gilbert, has said that a vaccine against Coronavirus (COVID-19) could be ready by September if everything goes perfectly well. Gilbert, a professor of Vaccinology at the Oxford University, said she is 80 percent confident that the vaccine being worked on by her team would be useful. She stated this during an interview with The Times on Saturday. “I think there’s a high chance that it will work based on other things that we have done with this type of vaccine,” Gilbert said. “It is not just a hunch, and as every week goes by, we have more data to look at. I would go for 80 percent, that is my personal view. “Nobody can promise it is going to work. We do not want to get to later this year [September] and discover we have a highly effective vaccine, and we have not got any vaccine to use. “We do not think we need facilities built, and there are facilities that can be switched over.” Meanwhile, the world has recorded 1.7 million COVID-19 cases, according to Worldometer, a website which gives real-time updates on the virus.

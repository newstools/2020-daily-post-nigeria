The Director-General, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Agency of Nigeria, (SMEDAN), Dr. Dikko Umaru Radda, has described the Late Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari, Malam Abba Kyari as a well-respected technocrat whose contributions to the socio-political and economic development of the country is unquantifiable. The eulogies were contained in a condolence message to President Buhari, a copy of which was made available to DAILY POST on Monday by Ibrahim Mohammed, Head Corporate Affairs Unit. Dr. Radda in the statement said the death of the Chief of Staff to the President was indeed “a great loss to the nation, his loyalty, patriotism and dedication to duty was legendary and worthy of emulation by all Nigerians. “He was the engine room and stabilizing factor in the Presidency and his impact was well felt in all the successful people-oriented programs of this administration,” the statement added. Dr. Radda urged President Muhammadu Buhari to “take solace in the fact that from Allah we come and to Him we shall all return, He prayed to Almighty Allah to grant Malam Abba Kyari eternal rest in Aljannatul Firdausi.” The SMEDAN DG also consoled the deceased family, government and people of Borno State over the demise of Late Abba Kyari and prayed Almighty Allah to grant them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.

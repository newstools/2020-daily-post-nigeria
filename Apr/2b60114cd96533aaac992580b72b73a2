Mr. Olisa Ifeajika, Chief Press Secretary to Delta Gov. Ifeanyi Okowa, has disclosed that the state had so far recorded two deaths and discharged two victims of COVID-19 disease. Ifeajika, who spoke with journalists on Wednesday, in Asaba, said that the state had recorded a total of seven cases of the disease as at date. He said that of the seven cases, three were stable and responding to treatment, two were discharged on April 28, while two died from the scourge. He said: “So far, it has been fine in the state because, from the onset, the governor took proactive measures even when the state had not recorded any confirmed case of coronavirus. “We put all the things that needed to be on the ground; we established four isolation and treatment centres while front line health personnel were adequately trained and retrained for the pandemic. “Incidentally, two weeks into the scourge, we recorded the Index case in the state and then the second one, who died in the process because he presented himself very late and also had underlying health issues. “So far, we have seven cases, with two deaths and three are active and doing very well while two were discharged yesterday – Tuesday – having tested negative two times. “It has been wonderful, and we pray that nothing negative happens again as far as the pandemic is concerned.” Meanwhile, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced that another 195 new cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the last 24 hours, bringing to 1,532, the number of confirmed cases in the country as of Tuesday night.

Lagos State Government has refuted speculations that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has relaxed the COVID-19 lockdown in the state. The Lagos State Chapter of the Cherubim & Seraphim had called on the government to allow Christians and Muslims carry out their spiritual responsibilities to God this weekend. But the Commissioner for Information in Lagos, Gbenga Omotoso, told journalists on Thursday that there was no plan to lift the order. He noted that it was only President Muhammadu Buhari who initiated the lockdown that would decide. “There’s a rumor going around that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has relaxed the lockdown in the state. “In the first place, the lockdown is not a device of the state, it’s a directive of the federal government. ”It was announced by the President himself, so if it’s going to be relaxed it will be the Federal Government that will announce to either relax it or extend it. ”Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has not relaxed any lockdown and we implore you all to continue to be responsive and abide by the rules.” The commissioner added that experts have told the government that the lockdown was the only way to fight coronavirus.

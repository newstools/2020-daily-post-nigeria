Nigerian Government through the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, has revealed the strategy the country has employed to tackle the raving novel coronavirus. Osagie spoke at the daily press briefing by the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 on Thursday. He pointed out Nigeria is not flattening the curve but is pushing the curve to one side so that it (Nigeria) can have enough time to prepare its ‘not very strong’ health system. “Every country has its own strategy to combat the coronavirus. In Nigeria, we are not flattening the curve but we are pushing the curve to one side so that we have enough time to prepare our ‘not very strong’ health system,” Osagie said. “Also, in the beginning, we did not have enough reagents; in fact, we carried out our tests in South Africa. “But two months down the line, we can carry out our own tests with the 13 existing NCDC laboratories across the country. “Concerning the use of rapid test kits, the World Health Organization (WHO), has not validated any of it. “They believe that the results are not reliable but it probably gives you a direction. Therefore, there is not enough faith in rapid diagnostic test.”

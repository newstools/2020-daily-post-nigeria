Wahidi Akanni, a former Chairman of Lagos State Football Association, says the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has been unfair to Gernot Rohr, the Super Eagles’ Head Coach. Akanni spoke on Monday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He said that the public disclosure of terms and conditions of a possible renewal of Rohr’s contract by the NFF was unnecessary. NFF President Amaju Pinnick recently disclosed that Rohr would be handed a new contract to sign if he agreed to the terms. But Akanni, an ex-international, said making Rohr’s contract public as Pinnick did would only mean that the two parties had not been communicating effectively. “I think, with the back and forth media correspondences between NFF and Rohr, it is obvious that both are not talking.” He insisted that a contract between an employee and his employer should not be in the public for that matter. “Changing the terms of an employee’s contract also should not be a problem if it’s acceptable by the employee.” Hoping that the matter will be resolved amicably soon, Akanni said: “one must acknowledge that NFF has no right to make the contract public because this will bring in a lot of negative sentiments against the coach”.

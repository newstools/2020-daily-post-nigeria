Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has said that the COVID-19 kits donated by Chinese billionaire, Jack Ma, are not contaminated. Mohammed stated this on Thursday during a presidential task force media briefing. The Minister labelled the report as fake news, which is causing distraction to the federal goverment’s efforts in curbing the spread of coronavirus. “The spike of fake news is distracting our fight against COVID-19 and this is quite unhelpful,” he said. Mohammed added that the PTF briefing is a platform that gives “only authentic and real-time information,” and commended the media for “devoting their time and resources to educating Nigerians on the government’s fight against COVID-19″.

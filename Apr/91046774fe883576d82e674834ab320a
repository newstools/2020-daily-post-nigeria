Lille striker, Victor Osimhen, has claimed he turned down a move to Arsenal, despite having a conversation with their former manager, Arsene Wenger. In an interview with the UK Independent, Osimhen says he feels he needed to start playing regularly despite being only 18 at the time. The Nigerian striker eventually signed for Wolfsburg in January 2017, amid interest from Barcelona and Juventus too. Several clubs expressed an interest in signing him, after he impressed at the 2015 FIFA U17 World Cup, where he scored 10 goals to win the Golden Boot award. “I spoke with Arsene Wenger after the tournament ended and he wanted me to come to Arsenal. “I had a lot of options. Barcelona, Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Juventus and the rest. “Arsenal was a good option but it wasn’t the best at the time. I wanted to start playing as soon as I turned 18. “I wanted to go to a place where I had time to invest in my game and improve physically. Wolfsburg showed me that possibility,” Osimhen said.

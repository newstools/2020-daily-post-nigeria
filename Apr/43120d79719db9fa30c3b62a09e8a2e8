Ivorian football legend, Didier Drogba has reacted to the viral video where two French doctors, Jean Paul Mira and Camille Locht opined that the new Coronavirus drug should be tested in Africa. Mira and Locht, who spoke on a live TV interview, which now has the highest trend on Twitter with the hashtag ‘Africans are not lab rats’ insisted that Africa is the best place to conduct such a test as they recalled how an experimental treatment for AIDS was carried out in Africa. Drogba who found the comment to be repulsive took to his Twitter account on Friday to share a picture from the video which has gone viral, saying,” I would like to vividly denounce those demeaning, false and most of all deeply racist words.” He said further, ”It is totally inconceivable.

It’s absolutely disgusting. ”African leaders have a responsibility to protect their populations from those horrendous conspiracies. ”May God protect us.” See Picture below…

A 6-week-old baby has died in the US state of Connecticut after being infected with the deadly coronavirus disease. Governor Ned Lamont made this known on his official Twitter account on Wednesday, stating that a test carried out on Tuesday night confirmed that the baby had COVID-19. According to him, the baby girl was found unresponsive and taken to the hospital late last week, but could not be revived. He wrote “It is with heartbreaking sadness today that we can confirm the first pediatric fatality in Connecticut linked to COVID19. ”A 6-week-old newborn from the Hartford area was brought unresponsive to a hospital late last week and could not be revived. ”Testing confirmed last night that the newborn was COVID-19 positive. ”This is absolutely heartbreaking. We believe this is one of the youngest lives lost anywhere due to complications relating to COVID-19. ”This is a virus that attacks our most fragile without mercy. ”This also stresses the importance of staying home and limiting exposure to other people. ”Your life and the lives of others could literally depend on it. ”Our prayers are with the family at this difficult time.@ Recall that the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Wednesday confirmed twenty three new cases of coronavirus in the country.

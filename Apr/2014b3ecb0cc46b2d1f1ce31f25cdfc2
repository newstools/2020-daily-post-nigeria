A former Governor of Delta State, James Ibori, has said he was expecting President Muhammadu Buhari’s late Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, to recover from Coronavirus because he was, “remarkably strong-willed”. This was contained in a statement signed by his Media Assistant, Tony Elunemunor, on Saturday and directed to the wife of the late Chief of Staff. “It is with great shock that I received the news, in the early hours of this morning, of the passing of your husband, my brother and friend, Alhaji Abba Kyari, the chief of staff to the President. “Though, I knew about his bout with COVID-19 infection, I had expected him to pull through because he was remarkably strong-willed, and the entire nation was praying for him. But on Friday, 17th April, he went the way of all mortals,” part of the statement read. Kyari’s death was announced on Friday, after he lost the battle to COVID-19 complications. He has since been buried in Abuja according to Islamic rites and passages.

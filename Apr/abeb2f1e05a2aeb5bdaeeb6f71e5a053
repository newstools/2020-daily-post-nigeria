The Katsina State Government has confirmed two new cases of coronavirus. Governor Aminu Bello Masari confirmed this in a tweet via his Twitter page on Sunday. He, therefore, ordered a total lockdown of the state capital with effect from 7:00 am on Tuesday, April 21, 2020. Masari said, “It is with grief that we announce the discovery of two new COVID-19 positive cases in Katsina LGA. “In line with our earlier stand, the Katsina LGA will be under lockdown effective from 7am Tuesday. Residents are hereby directed to #Stay at Home to tame the spread of the virus. “Stores and pharmacies that will be allowed to operate will be announced by the standing committee. Banks will remain open to enable civil servants to receive their salaries. We have also suspended, with immediate effect, inter-local government movements until further notice.” Recall that one Dr Aliyu Yakubu in the State lost his life due to COVID-19 complications.

The 15-member medical team from China, who recently completed their compulsory 14-day quarantine, have all tested negative for COVID-19. This was revealed by Nigeria’s Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, during the daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force in Abuja on Tuesday. According to Ehanire, “As for the Chinese persons who came in, the test has been done after they were quarantined for 14 days. “All of them were negative. After that, the Federal Ministry of Health is done with that particular case.” Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, was forced to debunk reports that one of the Chinese doctors had tested positive for the COVID-19. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and PTF Chairman, Boss Mustapha, had earlier explained that the Chinese doctors were here in advisory and capacity building roles.

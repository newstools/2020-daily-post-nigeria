Super Eagles winger, Ahmed Musa, has debunked reports claiming that he tested positive to COVID-19. Musa took to his Twitter page on Wednesday night, to explain that he and his family were self-isolating, after flying in from Saudi Arabia. He wrote: “Please ignore any false news about me or my family testing positive to Covid 19. “We are self isolating for 14 days as we just got in from Saudi Arabia as the law stipulates. “Stay safe! Maintain social distance. AVOID FAKE NEWS!” Musa currently plays his club football for Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia.

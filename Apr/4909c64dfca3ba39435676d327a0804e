Former Nigeria goalkeeper, Dosu Joseph, has slammed John Obi Mikel’s decision to take to criticize Turkish football authorities on social media. Major football leagues around the world were suspended following the outbreak of COVID-19, but the Super Lig continued playing matches behind closed doors. Mikel Obi took to his Instagram page to criticize the decision and eventually saw his contract with Trabzonspor terminated. Joseph, in an interview with Goal, insists the former Super Eagles captain should have handled the situation better. “What he said was okay but he should have not written it on social media. There is a footballers association in Turkey where he could write to and also the club’s captain. “I feel it is not the best going on social media. We have people that employed us and there is always a code of conduct,” he said.

The Arewa Council of Chiefs (ACC) in Lagos have alerted the public of an alleged plot to pitch Northerners against Lagosians. Alhaji Aliyu Bambado, the Galadiman of the Council, raised the alarm in a statement Saturday night. ACC disowned claims that worshippers, allegedly from the northern part of the country, “attacked” operatives of the Lagos State Environment Protection Agency (LASEPA) while enforcing the COVID-19 lockdown. He said that both claimants, Alhaji Aliyu Garuba, “Seriki Hausawa of Lagos” and the “Seriki Idi-Araba”, Alhaji Hassan Auyo, were unknown to Arewa Council of Chiefs. Bambado said the body is legally led by Alhaji Aminu Yaro Dogara, ACC Chairman and Sarkin Hausawan Lagos while his deputy is Alhaji (Dr) Mohammed Bambado, the Sarkin Fulani of Lagos State. It added: “Much as we hold in high esteem the Lagos State Government and other leaders of the land, we do not think it is appropriate for any group of individuals to use our respected traditional institution for spreading false information in the media in a desperate move to impress anyone in government. “Consequently, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation to ascertain the people trying to create bad blood between people of the North resident in Lagos and the respected Arewa Council of Chiefs. “We call on all northerners in Lagos State to disregard the spurious claims by the two individuals, remain law-abiding and go about their lawful activities.”

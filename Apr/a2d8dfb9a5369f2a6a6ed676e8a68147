Following the negative effect of COVID-19 pandemic on the nation’s economy, the Bauchi State Government has decided to slash the 2020 approved budget by half. Briefing newsmen on Wednesday at the Government House on the outcome of the State Executive Council Meeting (SEC), the Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Aminu Hassan Gamawa, said that the government has decided to curb unnecessary spending in order to enable government to save some cost. “The fact now is that every business is at its lowest and the government is not expecting any internally generated revenue, but we are assuring that government will look elsewhere for income in order to keep governance moving. “The medium-term projection upon which the budget was prepared has been reviewed which means the budget will operate on zero projection, details of which will be made public soon. “The state will be partially locked down before the end of the week in order to check the spread of COVID-19 among the people of Bauchi State.” The government will do everything possible to cushion the effects of the lockdown on the people,” he said. In another development, the Commissioner for Tourism and Culture, Moddibo, also disclosed what was decided at the SEC meeting that some animals at the Sumu Wildlife Park would be sold out by the government in order to be able to maintain the place and keep the animals healthy. Moddibo further explained that the animals are not been sold because of the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic, saying that the negotiations for the sale of the animals have been on since last year. He, however, said that the exact number of the animals to be sold and how much to be generated will be made public as soon as the deal was sealed.

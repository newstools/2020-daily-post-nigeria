Former Super Eagles captain, Joseph Yobo, has admitted he would be happy to see Liverpool crowned Premier League champions. Jurgen Klopp’s men are 25 points clear of Manchester City at the top of the table, with matches currently suspended due to the outbreak of COVID-19. There have been calls for the season to be ended prematurely and the Reds awarded the trophy. This suggestion has met with both support and criticisms. Yobo, who played for Liverpool’s Merseyside rivals Everton, however feels it would be unfair if they won’t win it. “If I want to be sentimental [as an Evertonian], I could have said I don’t want them to win it,” he told Goal. “But I love football and for the interest of global football, and the way Liverpool have played, they deserve to win the Premier League title – 25 points is not a joke. “From the way they played last season, winning the Champions League and losing the league to Manchester City by one point – on that note, it would be unfair if they are not crowned as champions.”

Governor Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State has confirmed that the state discharged 10 coronavirus patients on Saturday. The Governor, on his Twitter page, said the discharged patients tested negative twice. He said, “I am happy to inform you today that 10 of the 17 patients at our Ejigbo facility have tested negative twice for the virus. “In line with the National Centre for Disease Control protocol and will soon be released to join their families and live their normal lives.” Recall that twenty-two of the 127 returnees from Ivory Coast had been isolated by the Osun government after they tested positive for coronavirus.

The Akwa-Ibom State branch of the Nigeria Medical Association (NMA), Akwa Ibom State has confirmed the death of a medical doctor, Dr Dominic Essien after showing symptoms of COVID-19. Dr Nsikak Nyoyoko, the State Chairman who made this known while addressing members of the association in Uyo on Friday said the Physiotherapist, had a week history of fever, cough and shortness of breath which worsened on Thursday. He said the doctor’s SPO2 was low and on 72%, requiring him to be placed on oxygen at his clinic. “I immediately called upon a member of the State COVID-19 Response Team to swing into action and somehow, later last night, our colleague was admitted into ISH and managed by specialists in respiratory medicine. “With the symptoms elucidated above, a suspicion of COVID-19 was entertained, and he had his sample taken today awaiting transportation to the laboratory for COVID-19 testing. “Unfortunately, this revered Colleague of ours died mid-afternoon Thursday. Details of the case management are still sketchy as attempts to reach members of the Incident Management Committee (IMC) was unsuccessful as they were out for a meeting.” Nyoyoko while sympathizing with the doctor’s family, urged all members to remain calm and stay safe. He said the deceased was a renowned private practitioner, a physiotherapist and a lecturer in the Department of Physiology, University of Uyo. “It is a sad day for us at NMA Akwa Ibom State but be rest assured that the lessons learnt from this tragic event would not pass in vain.” Meanwhile, a medical practitioner, Dr. Chugbo Emeka, on Wednesday morning, died of Coronavirus-related complications after treating an infected patient in his private hospital in Lagos State.

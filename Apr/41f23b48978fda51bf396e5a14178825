Five Nigerians have tested positive for COVID-19 in China, according to the Daily Mail. The Guangzhou Health Commission claimed that four of them had reportedly visited an eatery called ‘Emma Food’ many times. The owner of the restaurant and her daughter later tested positive for coronavirus. The infected Nigerians were detected between March 28 and March 30, after 3,779 travellers from high-risk countries were screened. The coronavirus epidemic erupted in China after dozens of people suffering ‘mysterious viral pneumonia’ were linked to the same seafood market in Wuhan. Guangzhou is situated 1,028 kilometres (638 miles) south of the former epicentre.

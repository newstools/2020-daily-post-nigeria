With about 24 hours left to the end of the 28-day lockdown imposed by President Muhammadu Buhari, most Nigerians are uncertain about what decision will be taken. When Buhari gave the stay-at-home order on March 29, Nigeria had only 111 cases. When he extended it by another 14 days, there were officially 318 cases. By Sunday morning, there were 1182. State Governors have asked the president to consider a partial relaxation of the lockdown. In a letter signed by the chairman of the Nigerian Governors’ Forum (NGF), Governor Kayode Fayemi of Ekiti state, they requested for “inter-state lockdown, excluding movement of essential supplies – food, beverages, medical and pharmaceutical, petroleum supplies and agricultural products; internal free movement but with restrictions on large gatherings and assemblies; overnight curfews; lockdown of flights; and compulsory use of face masks/coverings in public.” In the last 27 days or so, Nigerians have struggled with economic downturn, a direct effect of the lockdown. Most people have become their own vigilantes, as crime rate has increased, with Lagosians in particular fighting off the menace of ‘1 million boys’. More people have lost their jobs and prices of essential commodities gone up. All eyes and ears will be locked to Buhari’s next nationwide broadcast, hoping for some form of positive update.

The Buhari administration is to commence distribution of 70,000 metric tonnes of food items to vulnerable Nigerians amid the COVID-19 crisis. The government explained that the move is part of efforts to cushion the effect of the lockdown in some states. Minister of Agriculture, Sabo Nanono, at the handover of 12,500 metric tonnes of food at the Minna Silo Complex in Niger State, said it comprises 10,000 metric tonnes of maize and 2,500 metric tonnes of garri. A total of 70,000 metric tonnes of garri, maize, millet and sorghum will be shared. At the ceremony, Nanono told the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, that the launch followed President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive. “The logistics is purely NEMA affairs. Ours is to hand over to the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs. Anybody that knows of garri knows that what we have here is high-quality garri.” Farouq, in her remarks, stated that NEMA will distribute these items to the population that is affected by the lockdown. “I am here in my capacity as the minister to receive these items and NEMA has started sending trucks to take the relief to affected states. “We have two states plus FCT. Those are the states that are most affected and they are the ones that have been locked down as pronounced by Mr. President. “We have a structure in place from the national down to state and the local government areas. 25 percent of the states’ population are the ones we are going to reach and these are the vulnerable people,” the minister added.

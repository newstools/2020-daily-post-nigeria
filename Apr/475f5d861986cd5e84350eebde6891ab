Ogun State has become the first State in Nigeria to set up a molecular laboratory for testing suspected cases of Coronavirus. Governor Dapo Abiodun said this in a statement on Wednesday. According to Abiodun, the State Government has purchased a molecular laboratory in its efforts to flatten the curve of the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Abiodun disclosed that the laboratory is at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (OOUTH), Sagamu, where he said finishing touches were being put to its operationalisation. When inaugurated, the molecular laboratory, according to the Governor, will minimise the test turn-around time which, he said is currently between 3-5 days, adding that it will fast-track the handling of positive cases. “It will also reduce the period of apprehension and anxiety for those suspected of infection and their relations,” Abiodun said. DAILY POST reports that a molecular laboratory test is essential in the checks for certain genes, proteins or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid and central in the detection and handling of the Coronavirus.

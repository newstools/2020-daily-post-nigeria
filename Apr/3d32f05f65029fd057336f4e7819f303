Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has advanced N20 million to operators of tricycles, otherwise known as Keke NAPEP to cushion the effect of ongoing lockdown on them. Operators of the vehicles for intracity movement in the state capital, Yola, and other major towns, notably Mubi and Numan, have been kept out of the streets since the statewide lockdown began last Tuesday. Governor Fintiri, in authorizing the N20 million palliative for the Keke NAPEP operators, commended their understanding in obeying the call on them to keep off the streets, according to a statement released Monday evening by his Press Secretary, Humwashi Wonosikou. “Government considered the critical transport sector especially the NAPEP operators hit by the 14-day lockdown and released the sum of N20,000,000.00 to the association to cushion the impact,” Wonosikou stated. He said the government had also reached out to other citizens of the state by giving them food items “The outpouring solidarity and support sparked by this shared challenge has been phenomenal, and this informed government’s intervention through the provision of food items for distribution to the vulnerable across the 21 local government areas of the state,” he stated.

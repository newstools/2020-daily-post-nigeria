Bishop Francis Wale-Oke, the National Deputy President, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), on Sunday, condoled with President Muhammadu Buhari over the death of his Chief of Staff, Malam Abba Kyari. Mallam Kyari passed away on Friday in Lagos after battling with Coronavirus (COVID-19). According to Wale-Oke, Kyari’s death should be a ‘wake-up call’ for all those concerned to do the needful by ensuring that our healthcare system is rejuvenated while other sectors do not suffer neglect. He also said that the Coronavirus pandemic had created an opportunity for Nigeria to develop its health sector. The Bishop said this in a statement issued by his media office in Ibadan on Sunday, NAN reports. He said: “Indeed, in Nigeria, God has been so good to us. This is because as deadly as the coronavirus disease is, our country has not recorded a high rate of deaths. “Yet, with all our inadequacies, God, by His mercy, has been keeping us safe. Even developed countries with better facilities are recording heavy casualties on a daily basis. “So, one of the lessons we should learn as a fall-out of this pandemic experience at the end of the day is for our government at all levels to ensure the rejuvenation and the development of our infrastructure, with particular attention to the health sector. “At least, with a time like this, the take-home lesson for all us should be that not all the time do money, position, and influence work. God is the ultimate.” He added: “Alhaji Abba Kyari’s loss is indeed painful. ”However, his death as a result of the disease should be a wake-up call for all those concerned to do the needful by ensuring that our healthcare system is rejuvenated while other sectors do not suffer neglect. “Thank God, we have the resources to take care of all these.”

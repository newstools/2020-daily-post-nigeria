Wind and rainstorm destroyed several buildings in Ganye, a mojor town in the southern part of Adamawa State, Tuesday evening. Many houses, schools and other properties had their roofs blown off, sources said, adding that electric poles and cables were also affected. Kabiru Njidda, the Information Officer of the Ganye Local Government Area, said in an alert, “Heavy wind and rainstorm destroyed several houses in Ganye LGA this evening. Also affected were electric poles and cables.” Njidda, who gave further insight on the incident, told our correspondent in a telephone conversation Tuesday night that the LGA, especially the council headquarters, Ganye town, had been thrown into darkness as a result of damage to electricity installations. He said, “There is currently no light. We’ve contacted officials concerned but the best we can expect is that maybe they will effect repairs tomorrow.” He said the rain lasted about 30 minutes but caused extensive destruction. “I have just left a man whose house and a new car were badly affected,” he said, explaining, “the wall of his house collapsed on his car, seriously denting the car.”

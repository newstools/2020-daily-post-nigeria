Arsenal and Manchester United could return to the Champions League, if the Premier League is cancelled, the UK Sun reports. On Tuesday, UEFA chiefs met with the 55 national associations including the English FA via video conference. At the meeting, European bosses drew up contingency plans if domestic seasons are unable to resume, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If this season is cancelled, UEFA has advised the associations to decide clubs who will play in European competitions next year, using their coefficient scores. The coefficient tables are compiled based on European performances over a rolling five-year period. The idea would see Arsenal, who are currently ninth and eight points off fourth-placed Chelsea, take one of English football’s four Champions League spots. Manchester United, three points behind the Blues in fifth, would also join Manchester City and Liverpool in Europe’s elite competition. Chelsea and Leicester, who are currently in the top four as well as Tottenham, would be forced to settle for Europa League football, while Sheffield United and Wolves would miss out altogether.

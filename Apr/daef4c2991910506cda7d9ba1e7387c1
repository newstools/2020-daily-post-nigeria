The Archbishop of Canterbury, The Most Reverend and Right Honourable Justin Welby, has expressed sadness over the death of President Muhammadu Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari. In a letter of condolence dated April 21, 2020, to Buhari, Welby said he recognised that “the Chief of Staff is a role on which one depends more than almost any other.” Welby stressed that the occupants of that strategic position “need to be trusted and willing to have your interests most closely at heart.” According to the Archbishop, who is a personal friend of the President, “The fact that you entrusted Abba Kyari with your messages to me and to others demonstrates the faith you have in him. “I am sure that his death is a significant blow to you personally, as well as to your government.” Commiserating with Kyari’s family, the Archbishop said: “This letter, therefore, brings my condolence at the loss of a man who struck me as remarkably intelligent and thoughtful.”

Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has hinted he expects to stay at Old Trafford despite receiving an incredible £400,000-a-week offer from his parent club Shanghai Shenhua. DAILY POST had reported that Shanghai Shenhua has not given up hope of Ighalo returning to China and has offered the Nigerian striker £400,000-a-week wages to stay on with them. Ighalo joined Manchester United last January transfer window on a six-month loan deal from Shenhua. The former Watford star has scored four goals in eight appearances for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side so far this season. The 30-year-old won the club’s March Goal-of-the-Month award after his sparkling effort goal against LASK in the Europa League. “I’m inspired by a lot of things at United, I’m really inspired, and I am looking forward to spending more time with the team,” Ighalo told Man United’s official website on Monday. “I’m inspired by the way the club is structured, and I am inspired by the direction of the club. “I’m inspired by the development of the young players and how they are coming through from the grassroots to the first team.” Ighalo is presently on self-isolation after the Premier League was suspended indefinitely due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

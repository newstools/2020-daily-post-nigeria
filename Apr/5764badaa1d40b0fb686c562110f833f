The president of Gabon’s football association (FEGAFOOT), Pierre Alain Mounguengui, has advised Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to leave Arsenal. In an interview with ESPN, he urged his compatriot to “secure a contract with a more ambitious club”. Aubameyang is the reigning equal top scorer in the Premier League, after netting 22 goals for the Gunners last term. However, the 30-year-old is yet to win any silverware since swapping Borussia Dortmund for the Emirates Stadium in 2018. “I don’t want to say that Arsenal aren’t ambitious, but Arsenal don’t have ambitions as high as some other clubs as far as Europe is concerned,” Mounguengui said. “So if Pierre could secure a contract with a more ambitious club, he’d definitely find his place there. “On an individual level, we all consider him to be among the best players in the world, but the advice I give to him is to continue to work and to attract the attention of the biggest clubs and the most ambitious clubs.”

Chukwuemeka Ezeife, a former Governor of Anambra State, has declared that Coronavirus cannot survive some herbal treatments. Ezeife said people who contracted COVID-19 and were privately treated at home recovered faster than those taken to isolation centres. The elder statesman stated this in a statement entitled, ‘A call for more aggressive treatment (cure) of Coronavirus.’ Ezeife said: “Information available on how families dealt with their relations who had tested positive with COVID-19, but were not taken to isolation centers or COVID-19 treatment centers, but were privately treated at home, suggest that the Coronavirus cannot survive some herbal treatments. “All fair-minded mature people must, irrespective of political leanings, commend the alertness, commitment, resolve, and the resulting effectiveness, with which people in government, have dealt with the invasion by the Coronavirus. “The responses of all the governments including African governments were very commendable. But there is, in one very critical area, a major defect, a lapse and, indeed, a failure. This is in the area of treating persons attacked by the virus.”

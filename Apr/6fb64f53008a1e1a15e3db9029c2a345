Nigeria’s Ministry of Power has clarified that no decision has been reached, on whether citizens will get two months of free electricity. The electricity distribution companies (DisCos) says the federal government would bear the financial responsibility of the exercise. The suggestion to give Nigerians free power has been bandied around as citizens struggle to come to terms with the impact of COVID-19. However, the Ministry said no official decision has been reached yet. “No decision has been taken by the federal government to provide Nigerians with free electricity for two months. “If and when that becomes a reality, it shall be announced officially. “Be rest assured that FG is exploring ways to ameliorate any hardship on Nigerians,” a tweet read.

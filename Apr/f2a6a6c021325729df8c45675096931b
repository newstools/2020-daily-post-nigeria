Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has chosen who is a better player between former Red Devils stars, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Robin van Persie. Ighalo, who won Man United’s March Goal-of-the-Month Award, said he would instead prefer to partner with Van Nistelrooy than Van Persie. According to the 30-year-old, Van Nistelrooy was a goalscorer and a positional striker like him that could run between defenders with space. When asked who he would pick between Van Nistelrooy and Van Persie, Ighalo told Periscope live with Juliet Bawuah: “I would gladly pick Van Nistelrooy. “Van Nistelrooy is a goalscorer. He does not show skills, and he does not try to dribble and all that. “He is a position striker, like me. “A striker who can run between defenders and have space. “That is the kind of striker I learn from. Don’t get me wrong. Van Persie is a good player.” Van Nistelrooy joined Manchester United from PSV Eindhoven in 2001. The 43-year-old went on to score 150 goals in his five seasons at Old Trafford, where he won one Premier League title and an FA Cup.

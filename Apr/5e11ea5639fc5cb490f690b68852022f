The Defence Headquarters says the Air Component of the Armed Forces troops has neutralized bandits in Pandogari area of Niger State. This was contained in a statement by the Acting Director, Defence Media Operations, Brig.-Gen. Bernard Onyeuko, on Wednesday. Onyeuko said attack was undertaken on March 31, following intelligence that the criminals had assembled under trees at Kalaibu Village near Pandogari. He disclosed that a Nigerian Air Force attack helicopter dispatched for an armed reconnaissance mission in the area spotted and engaged the bandits. “The Armed Forces of Nigeria, in furtherance of the objective of restoring peace and security in the North West, will sustain the offensive against the enemies of our nation until our mission is accomplished,” he said. Last week, a joint security team were involved in a fatal gun battle with bandits operating in the state. This occured around Galkogo Forest, in Shiroro Local Government Area on Monday. About 20 officers and men of the Nigerian Army, Nigeria Police and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) were killed.

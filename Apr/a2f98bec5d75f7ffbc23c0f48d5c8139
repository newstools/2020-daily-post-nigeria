Shehu Sani, former Kaduna lawmaker has reacted to the backlash at Pastor Chris Oyakhilome over the alleged relationship between COVID-19 pandemic, 5G network and the Antichrist. Oyakhilome in a viral video linked the Coronavirus and the 5G network to Antichrist. His comment has since stirred reactions from other pastors as well as Nigerians on social media. DAILY POST recalls that Pastor Matthew Ashimolowo of KICC, had expressed disappointment in pastors who allegedly bring up conspiracy theories. He warned Christians to avoid being deceived by some Church leaders linking the current shock in the world to the Antichrist. Also, Pastor Sam Adeyemi on Tuesday night debunked claims by Pastor Chris Oyakhilome that Churches were shut down by the government in order to install the 5G network. Making reference to 1918, Adeyemi said Churches, Mosques, schools, and markets were also shut in Nigeria during the influenza pandemic and it was not the Anti-Christ. Speaking on the development, Sani on his Twitter page urged those lashing out at Oyakhilome to channel their anger at the deficiency of Nigerian leaders. According to him, criticizing Oyakhilome would not solve the problem in Nigeria. On his Twitter page, he wrote: “Pastor Chris Oyakhilome’s views may be odd, but your anger and venom splashed at him will not solve your problems. “Face your leadership deficiency and deficits.”

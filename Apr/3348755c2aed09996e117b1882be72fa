The FCT Minister of State, Dr Ramatu Aliyu, on Thursday described as ‘fake news, reports that there are asymptomatic patients of COVID-19 receiving treatment at the Kubwa General Hospital. Aliyu made this known while reacting to posts on social media that there were 100 asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in Kubwa General Hospital. A statement issued by her Special Assistant on Media, Mr Austen Elemue, on Thursday said the minister, who visited the hospital on a fact finding mission, denied the reports.
“It is fake news taken to an extreme point especially at this critical period. “We are here on the basis of the news that over 100 patients of COVID-19 are in this facility receiving treatment. ”But then, it is good to clarify and restore confidence in our people, because once the residents begin to loose confidence in the health sector, then we are in for a more serious problem. “There are designated centres where COVID-19 patients are kept. However, there is need to clear the air and to restore confidence. ”We want to hear from you, but before you speak to us, I notice a calm atmosphere both in delivery ward to other wards in the hospital. I commend the management of this hospital,” she added.

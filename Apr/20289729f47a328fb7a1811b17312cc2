The Rivers State Government, on Friday, arrested 22 traders for violating its lockdown order. The traders were caught while entering the state from Anambra and neighbouring Abia State in a container at the back of a truck. Rivers State Health Commissioner, Professor Chike Princewill confirming their arrest, said the traders will be screened to confirm their coronavirus status. The health commissioner described the situation as embarrassing. “It is embarrassing that a transporter would convey human beings in a container, just to beat the lockdown order. “The traders after confirming their COVID-19 status will be tried in line with the extant laws in place to protect Rivers people,” Princewill added.

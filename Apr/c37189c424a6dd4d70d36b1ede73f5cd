A Regional Manager with a first generation bank in Kano State has reportedly died of suspected COVID -19 complications. The Nation, in its report, withheld the name of the financial institution. It quoted family sources as saying that the late banker fell ill on Friday and was first admitted at a private clinic. He was later referred to Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. The deceased in his early 50s, was rushed to a private clinic after he suffered high fever, cough and respiratory hiccups without getting medical care. He was placed on oxygen on arrival at the private clinic and the treatment was discontinued after he displayed no signs of stability. One Hajiya Salma Ahmed, a mother- in-law of the deceased, in a viral audio, recounted how the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) frustrated attempts to secure a helpline. She disclosed that “the family had called the “Kano NCDC” line several times but couldn’t get through. They finally got to “Abuja NCDC” and were assured that officials in Kano would visit the patient to take his samples. Adding that “No one visited up till my son-in-law died in agony”, Ahmed raised fears about the COVID-19 status of her daughter and other family members.

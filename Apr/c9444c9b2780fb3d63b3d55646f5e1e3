Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has said the club could “exploit” the transfer market in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The Red Devils are in a good position financially and last week confirmed they won’t be furloughing any of their staff due to the pandemic. United have been linked with possible summer moves for the likes of Tottenham striker Harry Kane and Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho. Both players were expected to command huge fees, but Solskjaer has hinted they may now be able to sign players for smaller sums, because of the financial strain COVID-19 could have on other clubs. “The market, who knows how the market is going to react to this? Who knows which clubs need to sell players? There might be just a situation there where you can exploit, and I know that we at Man Utd we are one of the biggest, and the biggest, financially well-off. “I’m sure we are capable, when we get back to normality, that we can do the business that we want to,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports.

Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has named Lille’s Victor Osimhen as the future of Nigerian football. Osimhen burst onto the scene at the 2015 U17 World Cup, where he won the Golden Boot and Silver Ball awards, as Nigeria clinched the trophy. The 21-year-old has scored four goals in nine appearances for the Super Eagles since making his senior debut in 2017. He was also part of the Nigeria squad that finished third at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt, where Ighalo emerged as the highest goalscorer. In Europe, Osimhen has been in fine form for Lille this season, scoring 18 goals in 38 appearances. “I talk to Osimhen, he’s a very nice boy. He’s a good guy. We talk, not almost every day, but almost every time I advise him,” Ighalo told Elegbete TV. “He’s the future of Nigerian football. He’s the future, he’s going to do so well in football. I always advise him to keep calm, keep working hard and the guy is going to be a celebrity, you know.”

President Idriss Deby has declared that Chadian troops will no longer participate in military operations outside the country’s borders. He said this was as part of National Army campaigns against Boko Haram and armed groups active in the Lake Chad region. “Our troops have died for Lake Chad and the Sahel. From today, no Chadian soldiers will take part in a military mission outside Chad,” Al-Jazeera quoted him as telling Chadian national TV. Deby’s lamented failures by allies to do more in the fight against Boko Haram and other terror sects including ISWAP. Chad said its offensive left 1,000 insurgents dead while 52 troops lost their lives. The area borders Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria. In 2015, the four countries and Benin Republic formed the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), to fight Boko Haram. But Chad complained to the Task Force after 92 soldiers were killed in Boma. The country wondered how Boko Haram passed through the area other nations were supposedly guarding. “Chad is alone in shouldering all the burden of the war against Boko Haram,” Al-Jazeera quoted Deby to have publicly protested.

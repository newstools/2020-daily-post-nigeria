Manchester United’s Luke Shaw has named Victor Moses as the toughest player he has faced in his career. Shaw and Moses faced each other twice during the 2012-2013 season, in the Premier League and FA Cup, with Chelsea winning both games. “People always think I’m joking, but one of my hardest games ever was against Victor Moses when I was coming in as a 17-year-old at Southampton. “Maybe because I was so young. He was really quick, direct, strong and that was a challenge for me. “I’ve played against the likes of Gareth Bale, Messi and Hazard, and they were all so good, but I always remember Victor Moses as a really tough opponent as well,” Shaw told United’s official website. Moses also came up against Shaw during the 2013-2014 season, during his loan spell with Liverpool.

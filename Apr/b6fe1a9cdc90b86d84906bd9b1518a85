Arsenal legend, Paul Merson, has urged Harry Kane to leave Tottenham. Merson feels Kane will not become the Premier League’s greatest goalscorer or win trophies under manager Jose Mourinho. The England has netted 181 goals in 278 appearances for Spurs and 32 for the Three Lions. However, Merson has claimed that Kane will not flourish under Mourinho’s style of football. “If Harry Kane wants to win stuff, he may have to leave Tottenham,” Merson told Sky Sports. “Will Kane get six or seven chances a game playing the way Jose Mourinho does? I don’t think so. For me that’s what he needs to weigh up. “He loves scoring goals, he wants to play for an attacking team, but I don’t see that happening next season, if Mourinho makes it tight and starts playing the way that made him one of the best managers of all time, and I think that’s what Kane is weighing up.”

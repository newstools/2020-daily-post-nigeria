Suspected kidnappers, Friday morning, killed one and abducted two others in Chikun Local Government area of Kaduna State. An eyewitness, Mr. Jeremiah Yuyoyo who disclosed this to DAILY POST, said the incident happened around 1:30 a.m. According to him, the kidnappers stormed the area, and started shooting sporadically. Unfortunately, a neighbour who raised alarm, was shot dead. “They came shooting sporadically. Everybody was afraid. The shooting left all residents of Gbagyi Villa in fear. They killed one of the local security men and went away with two persons, a husband and wife,” he said. Speaking further, he said they (residents of the affected area) alerted police authorities who came to the area, but couldn’t stay long, as they received another distress call. “While the police patrol team were in our area, they received another call that someone has been killed in Maraban Rido and they had to leave. “May God help the situation in Kaduna,” he prayed. It was gathered that the deceased was until his death, a student of Kaura Namoda Polytechnic, Zamfara State, while the abducted couple were said to have newly packed into the area.

He later sent in SMS “I will call you later.”

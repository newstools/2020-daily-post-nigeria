The Uselu Mobile Court in Benin, on Saturday, sentenced five persons for violating wearing of facemask and curfew imposed by Edo Government to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the state. The state government had imposed a statewide wearing of facemask in public places and dusk-to-dawn curfew, which commenced from 7p.m. to 6a.m. daily. Agbokhaode Ayo, who is the state Prosecuting Counsel, said that four persons violated the curfew, while one violated wearing of mask. Ayo added that they were apprehended at Uwasota and Uselu market axis, and pleaded liable to the offence. Presiding Chief Magistrate, Prince Mutairu Oare, directed the convicts to carry out community services in line with the state governmentâ€™s non-custodial regulation. The punishment included; clearing drains, shrubs, picking of trash, compulsory community sensitisation and grass cutting, among others. The court sentenced the violators for two days non-custodial community service. The Chief Magistrate, however, gave the convicts an option to pay a fine of N4,000 (for curfew violators) and N200 (mask violator)

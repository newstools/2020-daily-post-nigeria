The Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has confirmed that compulsory wearing of face masks in the state will begin in order to curb the spread of Coronavirus. Sanwo-Olu said this in a series of tweets on his official Twitter page on Sunday. According to him, face masks help to protect people from droplets and secretions from coughing and sneezing. He said: “Dear Lagosians, even as we observe the lockdown, we are kicking off #MaskUpLagos; the COMPULSORY wearing of face masks in Lagos. “Face masks help to protect us from droplets and secretions from coughing, sneezing, etc. as not everyone that is infected will show symptoms. “Face masks, combined with frequent hand washing, being conscious about NOT touching our face, as well as #SocialDistancing, are effective in slowing the spread. “The state government is currently producing about 3 million facemasks for distribution to the vulnerable. “N95 & surgical masks help our medical workers stay safe while cloth masks made to specifications that will be released by @LSMOH combined with other guidelines will help protect our residents from #COVID19. “The virus is in our communities, let’s take this seriously. #MaskUpLagos.” Meanwhile, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has announced 87 new cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria, bringing to 1,182 the total number of infected persons in the country,

Nigerian Government said it would enforce wearing of face masks in places where physical distancing is quite difficult to maintain such as market places. This was disclosed by the Director-General of National Center for Disease Control (NCDC), Dr Chikwe Ihekweazu, at the daily briefing of the Presidential Taskforce on Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) on Thursday. “Where physical distancing is quite difficult, like in markets, we will be firmer about prescribing the use of masks,” he said. He again advised Nigerians to stop stigmatising discharged patients as it will prevent people from willingly coming out for tests. “We should stop stigmatising COVID-19 patients. If we stigmatise patients, people will choose not to be tested and the virus might go unchecked and this lockdown will continue, ” he added. “In these times, what unites us is more than what divides us.” Ihekweazu further disclosed that every Friday by 6pm, the number of tests done by the center will be made public.

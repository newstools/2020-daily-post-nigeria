Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, says he is “planning two or three different scenarios” in the transfer market. Arteta replaced Unai Emery in December, after spending three years as Pep Guardiola’s understudy at Manchester City. The 38-year-old struggled to inspire a turnaround in the fortunes of Arsenal initially but was able to raise the quality of football at the Emirates, with results to boot. On Wednesday, FIFA announced that the summer transfer window will be moved amid the ongoing battle against COVID-19, while also proposing that all player contracts be extended until the season can resume. Arteta is already mulling over different options as he aims to bolster his squad. “I’m planning two or three different scenarios that we can face. Depending on one of those three, we will be able to do more, less or nothing,” he told Sky Sports. “We have to react daily. We don’t know what the financial situation is
going to be, we don’t know the rules, the timing, the window. There are so many things we cannot control at the moment.”

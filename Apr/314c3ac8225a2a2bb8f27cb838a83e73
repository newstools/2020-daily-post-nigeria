American rapper, Cardi B, has accused the Government of putting capitalism, money, trading, goods ahead of citizens health, hence the reason for increased cases of Coronavirus in the country. Cardi B, in a live chat on instagram with Bernard Sanders, an American politician, said if the American Government had taken the same measure it took in handling Ebola outbreak in Africa, Coronavirus outbreak in America would been on check. She said; “A lot of people felt it would have been racist or prejudice to close the border from China to America. “And I just feel like how come it wasn’t prejudice when America closed the border in West Africa when the Ebola virus was around, and the Ebola virus never even got to America.” Cardi B also accused the government of putting capitalism, money, trading, goods before citizens’ health. “I feel like they put capitalism, money, trading, goods before our health and that’s my problem “And instead of apologizing and giving us better things than $1600 stimulus check at one time, I feel like we deserve better. “Because they messed up, apologise for messing up and do better for us, for the people,” she added.

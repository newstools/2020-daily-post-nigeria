Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano, has ordered all government appointees in the state to resume work at their respective borders to ensure compliance to its closure. DAILY POST reports that even though there had been border closure in the state, commuter vehicles and travelers have been finding their way into the state from other states. A circular signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof Solo Chukwulobelu, ordered all government appointees to immediately comply to ensure that all the borders are closed. Part of Chukwulobelu’s circular read, “Following ongoing efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19 pandemic and observed continued influx of persons into the State especially through informal border routes thereby exposing the State to the risk of imported community spread of the virus, Government has resolved to strengthen enforcement of the border closures by involving community efforts. “In this wise, the following political appointees majorly Special Assistants to the Governor are hereby posted to designated border locations to support enforcement actions by the Police and other security agencies. “Likewise, porous and informal border points identified in various local communities with little presence of formal security will henceforth be manned by the following youths who will help prevent any form of movement into the State from those locations. “Political appointees and youths so posted MUST NOT indulge in any kind of extortion and unwholesome conduct but are empowered to be firm in disallowing movement of unauthorised persons, goods and services.” The SSG said the initiative by the initiative is purely to support existing and laudable efforts of the Police and other agencies and NOT to replace it. Vigilante groups in all communities bordering the State, youths and law enforcement agencies are also to join in the state to enforcement.

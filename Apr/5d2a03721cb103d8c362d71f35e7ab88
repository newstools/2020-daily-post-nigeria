Human rights activist and lawyer, Femi Falana, has told President Muhammadu Buhari to withdraw armed troops from the streets, amid the lockdown put in place because of the COVID-19 outbreak. This was contained in a statement released by Falana on Sunday. According to him, the troops enforcing the stay-at-home order were using the opportunity to abuse citizens’ rights. Falana cited how the Defence Headquarters denied the action of its officers, in some video clips that went viral last week, in a bid to cover up the acts. “However, based on the nationwide condemnation of the brutal killing of Joseph Pessu and the threat to rape women by a bunch of rampaging soldiers the Defence Headquarters turned round to announce that the culprits had been arrested. “Therefore, the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces should not hesitate to direct the service chiefs to withdraw all armed troops from further enforcing the COVID-19 Regulations,” part of the statement read.

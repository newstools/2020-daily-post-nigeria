Nigerian Army said it has arrested soldiers in a trending video clips openly threatening to rape Warri women and girls and infect them with HIV. This is coming after the Delta State Government had earlier dismissed the video as fake. Soldiers in the footage issued the threat after their colleague was allegedly killed by residents in retaliation of the murder of Joseph Pessu on Thursday amid the COVID-19 lockdown. “We will rape your women and give them HIV”, one of the personnel declared while protesting the death of a fellow soldier. However, in a statement issued via its verified Twitter account, @HQNigerianArmy, on Friday night, the army said the soldiers were arrested at 9 Brigade Ikeja Military Cantonment, Lagos State yesterday and that further investigations were ongoing. “Soldiers in a viral video using uncouth and uncivilized language purportedly threatening to molest women in Warri Delta State were arrested at 9 Brigade Ikeja Military Cantonment Lagos State today 3 April 2020 and further investigation is ongoing,” it stated. “The general public should be assured that the investigations will be swift and fair in accordance with applicable military laws. The outcome of the investigations will determine the most appropriate disciplinary measures that can be taken in the circumstances. “The Nigerian Army wishes to reiterate that it would not tolerate any form of irresponsibility and indiscipline on the part of any of its personnel.” Video:   Moment Nigerian Soldiers threaten to rape women In #Warri, #Delta State, infect them with #HIV. #HQNigerianArmy #Coronaviruslockdown #LockDownNigeria #COVID19 #Coronavirus A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Apr 3, 2020 at 12:03pm PDT

Fear has gripped residents of Kano after the State Ministry of Health announced the first COVID-19 death. The confirmation was made via the ministry’s Twitter handle, @SMOH. Malam Usman Abdul Hakeem, a resident of Janbulo area of Kano, expressed shock over the incident. “I fear for Kano”, he complained. NAN quoted him as saying that the situation was worrisome as the deceased was said to have been to many places after he returned to Kano. Another resident of Rijiyar Zaki, Alhaji Ibrahim Imam, described the situation as unfortunate. Imam appealed to residents to bear in mind that the virus,“has really started to penetrate the state.’’ “We need to know that the disease is real as it has already claimed a life in the state. Let’s keep ourselves and families safe.’’ Governor Abdullahi Ganduje has ordered a complete lockdown of the state for seven days, beginning from 10.00 p.m. on Thursday. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), Wednesday night, reported 34 new cases of COVID-19. Total cases in Nigeria stands at 407; Lagos State remains the worst hit. Meanwhile, Nigerians have condemned the federal government‘s criteria for the Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) scheme. Their reaction was sequel to the announcement by Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Sadiya Umar Farouq, that the Buhari administration considered Nigerians who buy N100 call credit as poor. Farouq explained that such citizens and others with N5,000 account-balance would benefit from the CCT.

Bayern Munich star, Joshua Zirkzee, has ended any possibility of representing Nigeria, after admitting he dreams of playing for the Netherlands national team. Joshua was born to Nigerian parents in the Netherlands, which makes him eligible to play for both countries. He has already featured for the Dutch at the U-17 level and says his next step is the senior team. The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr, have been tracking the 18-year-old for a while, with hopes of convincing him to represent the West African nation. However, when asked if he had thought about playing in the Euros competition for Netherland, Zirkzee told VTBL: “No, I’m not really working on that yet. I’m not a regular based player here, so I don’t think I should think about it then, but I have also seen how fast things can go, so of course, it is very secretly in the back of your mind. “Oranje is a dream and as a young footballer I think it makes sense to dream about it.”

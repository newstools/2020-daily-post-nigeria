Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed, has announced the result for his second coronavirus test. Mohammed, via his Twitter account, disclosed that the follow-up test returned negative. He expressed gratitude to God and thanked everyone for their prayers. “Alhamdulillah. I just received the green light. My second test for #COVID19 returned negative. I thank you all for your prayers & support even while I was in isolation. “Most importantly, all the praises & thanks be to Allah – the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. #GreaterBauchi”, he tweeted. Bala Mohammed, a former FCT Minister, tested positive a fortnight ago. Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, suffered a similar fate. However, he tested negative early in the week and has since resumed official duties. Nigeria currently has 276 cases of coronavirus.

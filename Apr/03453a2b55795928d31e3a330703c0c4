Heavy downpour, accompanied by windstorm, has thrown the major parts of Enugu and Anambra States into darkness. DAILY POST reports that the downpour, which lasted for about two hours, also blew off roofs of many residential and public buildings. Speaking on the development, the Enugu Electricity Distribution PLC (EEDC) said the situation, which led to loss of several High Tension (HT) and Low Tension (LT) poles, aluminum conductors as well as other line accessories, resulted to power outage on most of its 33KV and 11KV feeders. This development was contained in a release issued on Wednesday in Enugu by the Head, Corporate Communications, EEDC, Mr. Emeka Ezeh. According to Ezeh, “the heavy storm which occurred yesterday in Enugu and Anambra States, and in the early hours of today at Imo and Abia States respectively, destroyed electrical installations within the affected states, but mostly in Enugu State. “As a result of this, some of our feeders are out on fault, and this has led to loss of electricity supply to our customers in the affected areas”. EEDC, however, assured its customers that the company’s technical team are already working to evaluate the damages and immediately carry out repairs. “We appeal for understanding of our customers, while we assess the situation, work at addressing them and restoring power supply to the affected customers. “We regret the inconvenience this situation has caused our esteemed customers and assure them that supply will be gradually restored as repairs are completed”, Ezeh said.

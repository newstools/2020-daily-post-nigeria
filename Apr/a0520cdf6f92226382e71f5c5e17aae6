John Mikel Obi is in negotiations with Botafogo over a move, Yahoo Sports reports. The Brazilian club has made an offer to the former Super Eagles midfielder, who is now a free agent. Mikel Obiâ€™s contract with Trabzonspor was terminated in March, when he refused to play amid the coronavirus outbreak. The 32-year-old refused to delete an Instagram post criticizing Turkish football authorities, before his deal was cancelled. It appears Botafogo now sees Mikel as an alternative to Yaya Toure, after failing to sign the Ivorian earlier this year.

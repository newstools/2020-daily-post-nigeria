The remains of seven teenagers have been discovered in a church in Ethiopia. The gory scene was discovered in the eastern Oromia region, authorities said on Monday. It is still unclear how they entered the premises as there have been restrictions on mass gatherings, including large church services amid the coronavirus crisis. “The teenagers were inside a room at the St Joseph Church which housed a generator,” Commander Aschalew Alemu, East Shewa Zone police station spokesman told the ENA. Alemu disclosed that six males and one female under the age of 20 were discovered at about 3 a.m local time on Sunday. “We are now investigating if suffocation from the generator is the cause of the death,’’ he added. Eleven people had been arrested in connection with the deaths. DPA reports that Ethiopia, which has the largest Orthodox Christian population outside Europe, marked Easter on April 19.

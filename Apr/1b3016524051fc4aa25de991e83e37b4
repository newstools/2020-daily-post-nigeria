The Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, Lagos, on Saturday confirmed the death of a COVID-19 patient in the hospital. Prof. Chris Bode, LUTH Chief Medical Director, made this known in a statement issued by Prof. Wasiu Adeyemo, Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee (CMAC) of LUTH, on his behalf. According to him, a man was brought in unconscious to the LUTH Emergency unit late on the evening of Wednesday, April 2, by his friend. “Although they denied any history of recent travel, his presentation strongly suggested COVID-19. “He was handled professionally by the Infectious Diseases Consultant and his team without unduly exposing LUTH staff to danger. He died a few hours later. “Further investigations later revealed he had earlier performed a test at Yaba soon after he got back to Nigeria from Holland and the test was positive. “He was a known diabetic, hypertensive patient. He also had a kidney transplant for chronic kidney disease and was on immunosuppressant drugs. “The corpse has since been handed over to the appropriate Unit of the Lagos State Ministry of Health for safe burial according to international best practices. “Our Department of Community Medicine has moved swiftly to trace, follow-up and assist gallant staff who managed the patient,” Bode said. Meanwhile, the total number of Coronavirus cases in Nigeria as it stands is 209, according to NCDC.

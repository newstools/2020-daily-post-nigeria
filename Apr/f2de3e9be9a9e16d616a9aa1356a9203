Paul Okoye of the defunct music group, Psquare, has faulted the prosecution and conviction of Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele also known as “Jenifa” and her husband, JJC Skillz. Paul said Funke Akindele may have broken the law but the crowd in the courthouse committed ‘havoc’. DAILY POST recalls that the popular Nollywood actress and producer was arrested and arraigned by the Lagos State Police Command on Monday. Akindele was arraigned on a one-count criminal charge of flouting the Social Distance Directive contrary to Regulations 8 and 17 of the Lagos State Infectious Disease Regulations, 2020. Following their arraignment, both Akindele and her husband pleaded guilty to the charge. However, Paul Okoye says he wonders why those in the courtroom, including the Magistrate, was not convicted for defying the order. The singer called the Magistrate, Police, journalist and every other person that was present, stupid. Reacting to the development, the ‘Reason With Me’ crooner took to Instagram live to vent his splint on the trending issue. He said: “I am not supporting Funke Akindele; of course, she committed a crime. But I’m saying that all the people that were there; the lawyers, the police, journalists, everybody, you’re all stupid. “Funke Akindele committed a crime but all of una wey dey there, una commit crime, havoc. “If she is to do community service for 14 days and pay 100k, then all those people wey dey there suppose pay 1 million naira each, then do 10 years in jail,” he insisted. #funkeakindelebello Omo paul is the realest g out there, yeah Funke is wrong but God punish everyone present there, na now we sabi tackle issues abi, something isn’t just transparent in this story pic.twitter.com/g1k5DHJ6Wd — global artist (@_purple64) April 6, 2020

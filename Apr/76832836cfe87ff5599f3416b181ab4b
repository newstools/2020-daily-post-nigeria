Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday, extended the dusk-to-dawn curfew from 8pm to 6 am for another 14 days. The extension takes effect May 3. Obaseki, at a media briefing, explained that the measure was to safeguard the people amid the coronavirus crisis. He noted that the state had made tremendous progress in the area of screening, testing and improving awareness on the pandemic for our people. “Working closely with the public and private hospitals, we have screened no fewer than 20,000 people and tested 297 of them. This is the reason for the increased number of cases,” he said. “We are aggressively pushing to screen our minimum target of about 500,000 people and test about one percent of them which is about 5,000 in the next few weeks. “Of the 20,000 people we have screened and the 297 samples taken, we have recorded 37 confirmed cases as at today, discharged eight and lost three people. “It is worthy of note that late testing was a strong factor leading to fatality. That is why I am advising everybody to go out for screening at the numerous screening centres in the state.”

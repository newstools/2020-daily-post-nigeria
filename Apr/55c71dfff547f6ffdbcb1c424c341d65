The Rivers State Police Command has cautioned its men against violating the rights of residents of the state. The State Commissioner of Police, CP Mustapha Dandaura issued the warning in a statement circulated by the Police PRO, DSP Nnamdi Omoni in Port Harcourt. This came a day after the police arraigned over 100 violators of the restriction order of the Rivers State government before 3 Magistrate Courts in Port Harcourt. The violators were arraigned on 3 Counts bordering on breach of public peace following their arrests in different parts of Port Harcourt. But CP Dandaura, while addressing his men, charged them to be professional and act within the ambit of the law. He also appealed to the public and residents of the State to show understanding and put up with the temporary inconveniences they may suffer as a result of this all important assignment, noting that the present situation required sacrifices from all and sundry. According to the statement, “The Rivers State Commissioner of Police, CP Mustapha Dandaura has warned his men to carry out the Restriction Orders, with a modicum of civility and at all times, to be professional and avoid acts that will compromise the process, or that will pitch the public against the Police. “The CP gave this charge while addressing DPOs/HODs in a pre-deployment Briefing today at the State Headquarters Moscow Road Port Harcourt. The CP’s charge is coming on the heels of the IGP’s Directive against trampling on Citizens’ Rights. “The CP, who had earlier constituted a Monitoring Team, noted that he would personally go round to enforce conformity and warned DPOs/HODs to increase the supervision of their personnel or be caught up with vicarious liability. “The general public is hereby advised to report all cases of infraction to the Monitoring Team via the following Security numbers: 08032003514, 08028915462, 08182157778.”

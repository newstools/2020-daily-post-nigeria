Barcelona midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, is close to a move to Chelsea, according to Sport. Coutinho is currently on loan at Bayern Munich, but the Bundesliga club will not exercise their purchase option. The Brazilian, who had previously played for Liverpool in England is eyeing a return to the Premier League. Chelsea are hoping to negotiate down Barca’s current €90 million asking price for the player and Arsenal are also believed to be keen. The 27-year-old’s agent, Kia Joorabchian, recently admitted that the player “would love a return to the Premier League” one day. However, Joorabchian insists he will not influence which English club Coutinho chooses.

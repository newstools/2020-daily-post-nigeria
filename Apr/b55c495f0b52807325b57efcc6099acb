The Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, has relaxed the lockdown he imposed on the state two weeks ago. He said in a statewide broadcast Tuesday that people could now move anywhere across the state and workers on level one to 14 who were asked to work from home when he imposed a lockdown two weeks ago should resume normal office work with effect from Wednesday, April 15. Interstate movement remains banned, however, as vehicles would not be allowed into the state and entry into Adamawa from neighbouring Cameroon is similarly prohibited. Governor Fintiri also said schools would remain closed and religious worship involving more than 50 people prohibited. He ordered that Keke NAPEP, the mode of intra city transportation in the state capital, Yola and other major towns across the state, which had been barred since the initial lockdown two weeks ago, can now operate but should not take more than two passengers. The governor assured that despite the relaxation of the lockdown, the government remained resolute to keep COVID-19 out of the state. He said, “Fellow citizens, as a responsible government, we remain on high alert and will do everything to keep the state COVID-19 free. “In addition, screening and detection of suspected cases will be maintained at all entry points while internal surveillance will be sustained across the state.”

Former Super Eagles captain, Joseph Yobo, has named Austin ‘Jay Jay’ Okocha, as the best team-mate he had in the national team. Yobo, who burst onto the scene early, played with different generations of Nigerian players. His first major tournament was the 2002 Africa Cup of Nations, where he lined up along with Okocha, Finidi George, Sunday Oliseh and Kanu Nwankwo. Yobo was also part of the squad that had John Mikel Obi and Victor Moses and won the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations. “I was blessed and privileged to play with the older ones, the golden generation of Sunday Oliseh and Finidi George, and everybody that was in that set up, in the 2002 Nations Cup. “But unfortunately they couldn’t make it to the World Cup, so there was a missing link. “Overall one player that was very key and I still think is irreplaceable in the team with his quality is Jay-Jay Okocha because he’s a playmaker. He’s somebody that on his good day can win you a game on his own. “As my teammate, the things that I saw him do in training, some people didn’t see that in the game, he’s unique, he’s phenomenal,” Yobo told Nigeria Info FM Port Harcourt.

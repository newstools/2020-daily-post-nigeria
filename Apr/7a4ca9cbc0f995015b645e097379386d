Citizens have taken to Twitter with varying reactions to the statement. Here are a few as compiled by DAILY POST: @GbemiEreku: The incompetence at Aso Rock is astounding. @Handsomest100: Who else noticed that this Speech Buhari just gave had no directive? Nothing cogent? No direction at all. He’s just suggesting and rigmaroling. @La_VeeVeee: Mr. President we have had a massive rise of cases in Lagos, I don’t think it’s right to lift Lagos’ lockdown. @jidesanwoolu please sir let the lockdown in Lagos continue. Which kind wahala is this bikonu? @MaryOscar33: In everything that president Buhari just said now, it’s the curfew part that I don’t understand. Is it that the virus is only effective at night? @johnval95: Buhari extends Lockdown till 4th May in Lagos, FCT and Ogun, after which there will be gradual easing in the lockdown procedure. But, what does he mean by ‘gradual easing’? @OLAOLUROCKSTAR: President Buhari has given all of us General Market for 1 more week. @Ochikzee: Thank you Mr. President @MBuhari for listening to voice of the people, we shall win the battle against #COVID19! God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria. @nesytv:Buhari said we should pick 1, we thank God it’s not pick 2! Soonest we’ll checkup.

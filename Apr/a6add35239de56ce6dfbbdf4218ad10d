The president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, has revealed the conditions in the new contract offered to Super Eagles head coach, Gernot Rohr. Rohr has been in charge of the senior national team since 2016 and his current deal is expected to expire in July, 2020. On Monday, Pinnick disclosed that the German coach has been offered a new deal, which insists on him getting paid in naira and living in Nigeria. “We have told him. He must live in Nigeria. His salary will be in naira. He must go around the leagues and see how he can nurture the players,” Pinnick told Arise TV. “If he is able to accept it, we have a deal. There are a lot of coaches that want to coach Nigeria.” Rohr qualified the Eagles for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia and a third-place place finish at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt.

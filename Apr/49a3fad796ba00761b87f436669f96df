The Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje, has appealed to the President Muhammadu Buhari government to take urgent steps, to reactivate the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) COVID-19 testing centre at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital. Ganduje made the appeal during a press briefing held at the Government House today. The Governor, who described the situation as serious, stated that more isolation centres were also needed in the state and insisted the lockdown was firmly in force. “Our testing centre at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital has been down for some time and we know that the Presidential Centre has been doing all its best trying hard in order to bring it back to operation. “But this is causing a lot of problems for the people of Kano State. We ask the Federal Government to quicken and put this testing centre in order,” he said. Ganduje also said the state will soon commence the second phase of distribution of palliatives targeting 50,000 households, estimated to cost over N600million.

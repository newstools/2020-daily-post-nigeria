The Edo State Government on Monday confirmed that it recorded two new cases of coronavirus, making a total of 11 confirmed cases in the state. Recall that the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) had disclosed via its Twitter handle that Edo State had two new cases. The tweet read, “Ten new cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Nigeria: 6 in Lagos, 2 in FCT and 2 in Edo.” Confirming the development, the state’s Commissioner for Health, Dr Patrick Okundia, said, “The fight against coronavirus disease has been on in the state. “Our people have been told, but the message we are getting is that our people are not taking these messages seriously. This is a serious business. “As we are receiving new cases every day, the state has been prepared in fighting this disease by providing different isolation centers across the state. “We have four isolation centers in the state. One is at the Central Hospital Auchi, another one is at Irrua Specialist Hospital, we have one at University of Benin Teaching Hospital and one at Stella Obansajo Hospital. “The state has also provided a holding center at the Stella Obansajo Hospital where suspected cases of coronavirus who are awaiting results are going to be kept. “Anybody with symptoms should go straight to Stella Obansajo Hospital, doctors and nurses have been trained to attend to such people,” NAN quoted him as saying. He further urged the residents to work together with the state government in fighting the coronavirus pandemic.

The Kano State government has finally spoken about the increased death rate in the state. The state’s Commissioner of Information, Muhammad Garba, in a statement on Sunday, described it as a serious situation. Garba listed malaria and hypertension as some of the causes of the deaths. He however assured that the government is working towards keeping residents safe. “This explains why Kano, apart from being the most populous state, did not record a case of the pandemic until lately. “Though we agree that the situation on hand currently is serious, we are not resting on our oars in taking appropriate measures to ensure that the good people of Kano State, and indeed, residents in the state protect themselves from the novel COVID-19 pandemic,” he said.

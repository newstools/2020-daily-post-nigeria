The Governor of Bauchi State, Bala Mohammed, has said he went through hell during his three-week stay in isolation. Mohammed is one of the Nigerian governors that tested positive for Coronavirus. However, his second test came back negative. Speaking with journalists at Bauchi Government House, he spoke about his experience in isolation. “This disease that I was infected with is a terrible experience. I went through hell while in isolation for treatment. I felt like I was alone but the love, affection and prayers shown to me by the people of Bauchi State really kept me going. “I thank Allah that I have now been freed from the virus. I am sorry for the inconvenience it might have caused to anybody in Bauchi and Nigeria. It has never been my wishes to be infected,” he said. Mohammed also thanked everyone who prayed for him during the period. As of Sunday afternoon, there were six confirmed cases in Bauchi. It remains one of the lowest numbers in Nigeria.

Malaysian contraceptive giant is expected to produce 200 million fewer condoms than usual with the restrictions on its operations Chief executive, karex, Goh Miah Kiat has warned that supplies of contraceptives will be hit hard with disruption in supply and transport difficulties. He expressed worries about the supplies of condoms to developing countries.

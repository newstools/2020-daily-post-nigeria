The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), has disclosed that about 50 shanties were affected by an inferno at Olaiya, Mechanic Bus Stop, off Orege in Ajegunle, a suburb in Lagos State. The Public Affairs Officer of LASEMA, Mr Nosa Okunbor, diaclosed this in a statement in Lagos on Saturday. Okunbor said that the agency knew about the incident through an overnight distress call on one of its emergency lines 767/112, at about 01:55 am. He said LASEMA activated the Lagos State Emergency Response Plan and its Response Team to stop the inferno and investigate the cause of the incident. According to him, the incident took place at Olaiya Mechanic Bus Stop by 1 & 2 Hotel, off Orege, Ajegunle. “The fire incident occurred at Ajegunle, a suburb in Lagos, with large areas made up of wooden shanties and mostly occupied by people living in close quarters to each other. “The fire was reportedly ignited from a forgotten candle by one occupant of the shanty, which led to the fire engulfing the entire settlement covering approximately one acre of land. “The fire incident, which was put out by the LASEMA Response Team at 3pm did not record any loss of lives, or injuries to residents. “However, the fire was curtailed from escalating to other buildings by the combined effort of the LASEMA Response Team, the Lagos State and Federal Fire Services,” the statement read.

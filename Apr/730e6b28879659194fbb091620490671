Legendary Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, reportedly offered Cristiano Ronaldo to Barcelona, as he did not want the player to join Real Madrid. Former Madrid president, Ramon Calderon, claims Ferguson was desperate not to sell Ronaldo to the Spanish giants. The Portugal superstar eventually joined Los Blancos from United in the summer of 2009, but the deal itself was agreed the previous year. “(Alex) Ferguson did not want him to leave and in particular, he did not want him to join Madrid, as we had won even more trophies than Manchester United, so he offered the player to Barcelona instead. “Barcelona were delighted with the opportunity but Ronaldo was very clear about the commitment he had with Madrid and a document that had already been signed,” Calderon told Diario AS.

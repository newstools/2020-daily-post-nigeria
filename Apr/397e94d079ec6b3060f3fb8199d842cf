The Enugu State Police Command has debunked reports that a river at Umumba Ndiagu Community in Ezeagu Local Government Area, turned into ‘a blood-like colour.’ A statement in Enugu on Friday by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Daniel Ndukwe, said that there was no such incident in the said community or anywhere in the state, contrary to the rumour mill.
Ndukwe said that the Commissioner of Police in the state, Mr Ahmad Abdurrahman urged residents to discountenance such false information and its unscrupulous peddlers, and remain vigilant, focused and steadfast in this all-important fight against Coronavirus. “The above position of the Command is based on the outcome of an investigation conducted to ascertain the veracity or otherwise of the alleged incidence. “The investigation included a visit to the said river and interview of members of the community, by the Divisional Police Officer in-charge of Umumba Police Division, CSP Iheanyi Onu, and his team. “The investigation, which was ordered by Commissioner of Police, reveals that the alleged river, known as “River Zizi” and runs through Umuavuka and Umuogbuefi villages of Umumba Ndiagu Community, did not at anytime change into red or looked like blood. “To this end, the commissioner is using this medium to warn person(s) peddling such falsehood through the social media, with the intent to misinform and mislead the general public, to desist forthwith. “This is because the Command, under his watch, will not fail to bring to book anyone found culpable, especially in these trying times of the COVID-19 pandemic that requires all hands to be on deck in fighting the scourge,’’ NAN quoted him as saying.

The leader of a cult gang, which has been terrorizing some parts of Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, Moshood Oladokun, popularly known as Ekugbemi is dead. DAILY POST gathered that Oladokun, who reportedly died and resurrected a few hours after being taken to his father’s shrine, finally died Saturday night on his way to hospital. It could be recalled that no fewer than fifteen (15) residents of Ibadan sustained various degrees of injuries when two factions of cult groups led by Oladokun and Ebila Biola engaged each other over collection of land royalty. Oladokun was attacked at his hideout in Olomi-Olunde area of Ibadan by a rival group led by one notorious gang leader called Biola, the leader of “One million boys”. A source who asked not to be named said Oladokun died but got resurrected after being taken to his father’s shrine. The source, however, said that Oladokun finally died late Saturday night as a result of losing much blood from the gunshot, matchet cut and other dangerous weapon used in attacking him. According to the source, “We were all indoor when the news got to us that Oladokun has been murdered. His wife called him that she has been held captive by some hoodlums around the Olomi-Olunde area. He got to the venue and seized two motorcycles brought by those hoodlums which he planned to take to the police station. “On his way to the police station, he was attacked with a gun, axes and cutlass by Biola-led ‘One Million Boys gang’. There, he was confirmed dead in a pool of blood. “Before he was taken to his father’s shrine, we all confirmed his death. At the shrine, one of his father’s friends came with a hen and started some incantations. He dropped the hen and Moshood sneezed, while the hen died immediately. Later in the night, he gave up the ghost, having lost so much blood.” The Police Public Relations Officer of the State Police Command, Olugbenga Fadeyi confirmed the death of the gang leader to DAILY POST on Sunday. Fadeyi said “Yes, he has died”.

The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has said that the only weapon to combat Coronavirus (COVID-19) is by applying the use of ‘Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI). According to Lai Mohammed, the use of NPI means; largely sensitization, advocacy, keeping very good hygiene, social distancing, not shaking hands, and no gathering. The Minister made the remark in Abuja when he featured on the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum to give an update on Government’s efforts at containing the pandemic. He warned that the spike in fake news and misinformation, despite repeated caution by the Government, is distracting the fight against COVID-19. According to him, the Government is particularly worried about unverified local therapies circulating on social media as a cure to COVID-19, when in fact, no known cure has been developed for the disease. “If you go by Whatsapp platform, there are so many myths and cures for COVID-19 today. “Some people will tell you, and it cannot affect Africans or the disease does not even exist at all while some will say, all you need to do is to take garlic, take ginger. “As we speak today, there is no vaccine or medicine for COVID-19. “The only weapon to combat the virus is what we called Non-Pharmaceutical Intervention (NPI), which is largely sensitisation, advocacy, keeping very good hygiene, social distancing, not shaking hands, and no gathering. “These are the only effective ways to contain the pandemic, and that is why governments are declaring total lockdown. “Once it starts spreading, no healthcare in the world can survive it,” Lai Mohammed said. Meanwhile, 190 COVID-19 cases have been recorded in Nigeria, according to NCDC.

Nigeria’s former Finance Minister, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has been named a member of the External Advisory Group constituted by the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva. This was contained in a statement signed by Georgieva on Friday. It added that the group will meet a few times a year, to provide perspectives on key developments and policy issues. “Even before the spread of COVID-19 and the dramatic health, economic, and financial disruptions it has brought, IMF members confronted a rapidly evolving world and complex policy issues. “To serve our membership well in this context, we need top-notch input and expertise from the widest range of sources, inside and outside the Fund. “Toward this end, I am proud that an exceptional and diverse group of eminent individuals with high-level policy, market, and private sector experience has agreed to serve on my External Advisory Group. Today we had a dynamic discussion to gain their insights, and to receive informal reactions to our ideas and approaches,” Georgieva said. Okonjo-Iweala was also recently announced as a member of South Africa’s presidential economic advisory council.

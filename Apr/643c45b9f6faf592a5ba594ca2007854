Cross River State Governor, Prof Ben Ayade took part in the enforcement of the shutdown order between his State and Akwa Ibom State. The Governor was at the boundary of the two States Tuesday night and personally took part in the enforcement of the ban on human and vehicular movements into the state. The Governor who arrived the Calabar-Itu head bridge before mid-night on Tuesday, spent several hours with members of the state COVID-19 task force, and departing at about 9am on Wednesday. Consequently, there were long queues of vehicles on both sides of the boundary, as the task force prevented movement across the boundary. Speaking to newsmen, the governor said he was denying himself sleep so that the people of the state can sleep. According to him, leading the enforcement team himself was to ensure that the boundary was totally locked down in line with his directive to ensure the state remains COVID-19 free. He said the strict enforcement of the order was necessitated by the reality that all the neighbouring states have recorded incidences of coronavirus infections. “We will know no sleep so that our people can sleep. It is for the sake of their own security and safety that we are all out here.” At about 8am the following morning, the Governor personally screened trapped vehicles, allowing only those on essential services, including newspaper distributors to make it through the boundary, after being tested by medical personnel. Those considered to be rendering non-essential services were turned back. The governor announced that he would be embarking on a similar exercise at the border between Cameroon and the state. “Our ambition is to have zero incidence of Coronavirus in the state. While other states are locking down, we are locking out. We are locking out because inside our state, we are safe and free. “Those who locked down, locked down with the virus but for Cross River, we are locking out, not locking down. That way, we are staying safe.”

The Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered the Kano State Government and the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to appear before him next week. They were asked to show cause why they should not be ordered to unseal Tiamin Rice Mill located along Zaria road in Kano. The Governor Umar Ganduje administration shut the company “due to complaints of air pollution which could aggravate coronavirus patients”. Commissioner for Environment, Kabiru Ibrahim Getso, told DAILY POST that the firm, which produces 320 metric tonnes of rice daily and has 400 staff, was locked after three different petitions from members of the host community. Ruling in an application filed by Tiamin Rice Limited, Tiamin Multi Services Global Ltd and Alhaji Aliyu Ibrahim, Justice Okon Abang ordered Kano authorities and the I-G to be at the court on Monday, April 27. Counsel to the applicants, Adeboyega Awomolo, had prayed for an interim order to compel the four respondents to vacate the premises immediately. They are the Inspector-General of Police, the Commissioner of Police Kano State, the Government of Kano State and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC). Justice Abang, in his bench ruling, ordered that the ex parte be converted to motion on notice to allow the respondents to appear before the court to explain why the reliefs sought by the company should be granted. The Judge ordered Tiamin Rice Limited to serve court processes on the respondents.

The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has alerted Nigerians of messages being spread by a fraudulent website The fake website (https://covid-19-fg-grant.blogspot.com/?=1) is asking Nigerian citizens to apply for a free internet bundle and claiming partnership with the NCC. “Nigerian government, in collaboration with NCC, is offering all Nigerian citizens up to 20GB of data to stay at home and get up-to-date information in a bid to counter the spread of COVID-19. All Nigeria citizens are entitled to free Internet connection to stay at home safely and enjoy the Internet in a bid to control the spread of COVID-19. The free Internet package is available to everyone starting from Friday, 27th March, 2020,” the website claimed. NCC said the website asks Nigerians to apply for the free Internet by clicking a web link, which automatically takes them to a webpage with a dialogue box to fill in their bio data. The agency stated that neither the Nigerian government nor the commission authorised the dubious message. NCC advised operators and citizens discountenance the falsehood which is circulating. The commission reiterated its commitment towards deepening access to telecoms services and its dedication safeguarding the rights of over 128 million internet users across mobile networks in Nigeria.

Nigerian Government through the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 has said that the gradual reopening of the economy will be done in phases, spanning a total of six weeks broken into three tranches of two weeks each. The task force said that this phased strategy is designed to reduce the pains of socio-economic disruptions. It also disclosed that the period would enable for a strengthening of the public health response which would reduce the recovery of the economy and provide succour to the poor and vulnerable in society. This was made known on Wednesday by Chairman of the task force and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha. He spoke during the daily briefing on COVID-19, adding that state governments have been encouraged to provide leadership in engaging relevant associations responsible for various sectors. Mustapha said, “In line with Mr. President’s directive in paragraphs 38-41 of his broadcast, the PTF has developed sector-specific guidelines. The gradual reopening of the economy will span a total of six weeks broken into three tranches of two weeks each. ”This phased strategy is designed to reduce the pains of socio-economic disruptions while strengthening our public health response, which would ultimately reduce the recovery of our economy and provide succour to the poor and vulnerable. “To underscore the collaborative efforts with Sub-National levels of Government, they are encouraged to provide leadership in engaging relevant associations responsible for various sectors e.g market associations and transport unions for orderly and effective implementation. Similarly, I want to emphasise the need for the security agencies to strictly enforce these new measures that have been put in place.”

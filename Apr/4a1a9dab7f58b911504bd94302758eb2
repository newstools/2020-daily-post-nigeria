Following the ease of the lockdown in Lagos and Ogun States as well as the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja, President Muhammadu Buhari has announced new measures. He said the directives were meant to safeguard Nigerians amid the coronavirus crisis. Buhari, in a nationwide broadcast Monday night, announced that he had approved a phased and gradual easing of lockdown measures from May 4 “However, this will be followed strictly with aggressive reinforcement of testing and contact tracing measures while allowing the restoration of some economic and business activities in certain sectors”, the Nigerian leader said. “The highlights of the new nationwide measures are as follows; Selected businesses and offices can open from 9am to 6pm; There will be an overnight curfew from 8pm to 6am. “This means all movements will be prohibited during this period except essential services; There will be a ban on non-essential inter-state passenger travel until further notice; Partial and controlled interstate movement of goods and services will be allowed for the movement of goods and services from producers to consumers. “We will strictly ensure the mandatory use of face masks or coverings in public in addition to maintaining physical distancing and personal hygiene. Furthermore, the restrictions on social and religious gathers shall remain in place. State Governments, corporate organisations and philanthropists are encouraged to support the production of cloth masks for citizens. “For the avoidance of doubt, the lockdown in the FCT, Lagos & Ogun States shall remain in place until these new ones come into effect on May 4, 2020”.

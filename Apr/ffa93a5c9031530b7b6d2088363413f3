Juventus forward, Paulo Dybala, has told his team-mate, Cristiano Ronaldo, that he is hated in his country because of his figure and how he walks. Dybala has been playing with Ronaldo since 2018, when the Portugal forward arrived from Real Madrid. He is one of the few footballers that have lined up alongside Ronaldo and rival, Lionel Messi. Dybala plays with Messi in the Argentina national team. Speaking to the Argentinian Football Association, Dybala said of Ronaldo: “I said to him, “Cristiano, in Argentina, we hate you a bit because of your figure, because of how you are, of how you walk”. “The truth is that, you’ve surprised me because I’ve found you to be different.”

Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has named Trent Alexander-Arnold as his best ‘signing’ since he took over the club. Klopp was named Reds boss in 2015. Since then he has signed players like Sadio Mane, Mohammed Salah, Virgil van Dijk, etc. Overall, it has been a mix of big-money and relative bargains. However, it is the discovery of Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool’s Academy that Klopp has really enjoyed. “It’s Trent [Alexander-Arnold],” Klopp tells the Pure Football Podcast. “We didn’t have to buy him but Pep Lijnders, my assistant brought him around and said: ‘He played No.6 [role] for me. He played full-back, he played right-wing, left-wing’ “But [he was] not fit enough so we had to work on that. But then he made steps by himself that were really unbelievable and that was really nice to see.”

The Premier League has decided that June 8, is the best-case scenario for the league to restart. Clubs in the top flight are still eager to finish the 2019/2020 season. However, the proposal of completing the campaign by June 30, was not discussed during their meeting on Friday. All the teams were represented on the video call, with the focus on different models for completing the season. Clubs were shown different models for games restarting and being played in June, July and August. But the Premier League insisted the season will not resume, until the UK government decides it is safe to do so. Each club has either nine or 10 games left to play. The government announced on Thursday, that the lockdown would be in place for at least another three weeks until May 7.

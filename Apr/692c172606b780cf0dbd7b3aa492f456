President Muhammadu Buhari has come under attack for announcing presidential pardon for a former minister, the late Anthony Enahoro. A former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, blasted the president for pardoning Enahoro, who was pardoned by Gen. Yakubu Gowon administration and also made a minister by the same government in 1966. Fani-Kayode wondered if the president and the people working with him understand history at all or if they have lost their minds for announcing state pardon for a man who had been pardoned already. “You say you have given a pardon to Chief Anthony Enahoro forgetting that he was pardoned by Gen. Gowon in 1966 and appointed Minister of Information thereafter,” Fani-Kayode tweeted via @realFFK on Saturday. “What is wrong with you? Have you lost your mind and memory? Does ANYONE in your Govt. know any history or have any brains?” DAILY POST reported during the week that President Muhammadu Buhari granted a presidential pardon to late Prof. Ambrose Ali, late Chief Anthony Enahoro, ex-Lieutenant Colonel Moses Effiong, Major EJ Olanrewaju, and Ajayi Olusola Babalola, who were ex-convicts. The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, made this known at a world press conference to announce Buhari’s amnesty to the inmates, explaining that the president had also approved the release of 2,600 inmates across various custodial centres in the country in a move to decongest the custodial centres.

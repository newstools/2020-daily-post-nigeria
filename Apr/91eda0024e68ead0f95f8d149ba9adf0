The Union of European Football Association (UEFA) has postponed this season’s Champions League and Europa League and other European competitions until further notice as Coronavirus (COVID-19) continues to spread across the world. UEFA said this in a full statement on its official website on Wednesday after the UEFA video conference meeting with 55 national associations. “All UEFA competition matches, including the centralized international friendly matches, remain postponed until further notice,” the statement read. “All national team matches for men and women due to be played in June 2020 are postponed until further notice. “This includes the play-off matches for UEFA EURO 2020 and qualifying matches for UEFA Women’s EURO 2021. “UEFA will set new deadlines in due course.” DAILY POST recalls that UEFA had last month suspended Europe top-flight competitions and other tournaments due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

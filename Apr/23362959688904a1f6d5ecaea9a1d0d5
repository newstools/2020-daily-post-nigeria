Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has slammed Chelsea board over their pursuit of £75million worth Barcelona midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, amid the COVID-19 pandemic across the globe. DAILY POST recalls that Chelsea is already in talks with Coutinho’s agent as they look to bolster Frank Lampard’s squad this summer transfer window after they failed to sign any player last January. But Neville believes it is “illogical” for the Blues hierarchy to be considering transfer moves at a time of Coronavirus crisis when their current players could well be set to take pay cuts. “It’s like a parallel universe. Chelsea captain Cesar Azpilicueta has been in talks with the club’s board over the past three weeks as they’re looking for a 10/15 percent pay cut,” Neville told Sky Sports. “For the Chelsea players to hear in the next breath that the club is looking to buy Philippe Coutinho for £75m, it is like, “Which one is it?” “If I were a player now, I would be looking at a wage deferral that potentially turns into a cut at a certain point in time. “But if the club increases its budget or signs a player for £75m, you have to pay our money first. “I would say, “you can’t go and sign a player for £75m and then say you can’t pay us fully”. It’s just illogical, and it does not make sense.”

Police authorities have said that the youth gunned to death in Onitsha yesterday was among those who attempted to snatch an AK47 riffle from a police man. He claimed that the youths earlier attacked him with substance suspected to be acid. An unidentified youth was on Wednesday killed by a police man during a protest by youths of the Nkpor area of Onitsha over the lockdown order. But Anambra State Police command in a press release denied the allegation, saying the attack was an unprovoked one by the youths who had the intention of seizing the officer’s fun. The release signed by the spokesperson of the command, SP Haruna Mohammed stated, “On 15/04/2020 at about 2pm, Police patrol team while on routine patrol to enforce the lockdown order around New Tyres by UBA, Nkpor in Idemili North LGA of Anambra State suddenly came under unprovoked attack by a group of miscreants with substance suspected to be acid. “As a result, one Operative attached to the team Cpl Christopher Ozor sustained serious injuries all over his body following the attack while the hoodlums rushed his AK 47 rifle with 30 rounds of live ammunition in a bid to snatch it. The team swiftly responded and repelled the hoodlums with gunshots and retrieved the AK 47rifle from them. “Meanwhile, one of the attackers who was fatally wounded was prevented by the miscreants from being taken to the hospital but the injured Police man was rushed to the hospital for medical attention.” As a result of the death, Youths of the area mobilized in their hundreds with offensive weapons, going on rampage at Nkpor and New Parts general area, destroying Police patrol vehicle with Registration number, 009 attached to Awada Division and other Government properties. Haruna said that consequently, police reinforcement, comprising PMF, SARS, Special Anti-cult Unit and other sister agencies were drafted to the area to restore normalcy, while investigation was still ongoing.

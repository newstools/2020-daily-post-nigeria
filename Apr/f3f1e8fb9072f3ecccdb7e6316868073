The Yoruba socio-cultural organization, Afenifere on Monday revealed the region President Muhammadu Buhari’s next Chief of Staff may come from. Afenifere’s National Publicity Secretary, Yinka Odumakin said Buhari will mostly likely pick a Northerner. Speaking with DAILY POST, Odumakin said it will be a miracle for Buhari to pick somebody from another region of the country. On the qualities Buhari’s next CoS should possess, Odumakin stressed that the president may likely appoint somebody who will project the alleged lopsided, regional image of his government. According to Odumakin: “If it’s a presidency with national perspective, then the next CoS should come from another part of the country but given the president that we know, it will be a miracle to pick somebody outside the North. “Well, you can’t have a Chief of Staff whose character is different from that of the regime. “They will obviously pick somebody who will continue what they have been doing in terms of no national perspective, and lopsidedness. “These are the characters we know and whoever Buhari will pick may continue with such.” Recall that Buhari’s former CoS, Abba Kyari had died last week Friday in a private hospital in Lagos State. He was, however, buried on Saturday in Abuja according to Islamic belief.

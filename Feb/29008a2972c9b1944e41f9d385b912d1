Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has urged his side to ‘correct’ their humiliating 4-0 defeat against Manchester United when they take on the Red Devils in tonight’s Premier League clash at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea was defeated 4-0 by Man United in the Premier League at Old Trafford earlier this season, but Lampard believes it did not feel nice for the Blues to lose the encounter despite their impressive performances against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. “I didn’t see Chelsea’s 4-0 defeat to Man United at Old Trafford earlier this season as a real influential moment,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying. “It did not feel nice to lose with such a scoreline on that day. “It was only a surprise considering our performances against them, we had more possession, shots, and even hit the woodwork twice. “It would be great for us to correct it tonight, but at the same time, I did not take it as a huge upsetting thing. “Our two performances against Man United and Liverpool earlier in the season shows that we could achieve this term.” The match kick-off between Chelsea and Man United is 9 pm.

Manchester United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, will sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as manager, if the team fails to finish in the top six and miss out on Europe altogether, according to the UK Mirror. United play Derby County in the next round of the FA Cup and Club Brugge in the last 16 of the Europa League. Solskjaer continues to retain Woodward’s support, but the American will be forced to act if the season ends badly. United’s sponsors are believed to have clauses in their contracts, that will reduce the club’s spending power in the summer, if the Red Devils fail to secure Champions League qualification. Mauricio Pochettino is on standby to replace Solskjaer, if he eventually gets the boot at Old Trafford. Pochettino has been out of work since he was sacked by Tottenham in November.

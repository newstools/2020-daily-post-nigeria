Manchester United coach, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hailed striker, Odion Ighalo ahead of his side’s UEFA Europa League round of 32 first-leg clash against Club Brugge on Thursday in Belgium. Solskjaer branded Ighalo as a goal scorer that knows how to play as a centre-forward. Ighalo would hope to make his first start for Solskjaer’s men against Club Brugge after making his debut in the Red Devils’ 2-0 win over Chelsea from the bench last Monday. “Odion Ighalo is a goal scorer and a box striker,” the Norwegian said as quoted by Man United’s official website on Wednesday. “He is a unique player for us. We have seen his ability in training and knows how to play his position very well. “He had a good chance against Chelsea on Monday that would have been a good start for him at Man United, but unluckily, he did not score, and that I am confident he will take his chances going forward. “We will try to give him much game time, and I believe he is going to integrate quickly.”

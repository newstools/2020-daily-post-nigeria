The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, has dared the Nigerian Police, to shoot guests at the funeral of his parents on Friday. Kanu stated this during a broadcast on Radio Biafra last weekend. The IPOB leader also hinted that he would not return to Nigeria for the funeral and would be monitoring events from abroad. Kanu was reacting to a statement from the police, in which they vowed to disrupt the burial ceremony, if IPOB members attend the event. “Instead of them to be remorseful for causing the death of my father and mother, all they are saying is we will come and shoot at people that attend the burial,” he said. “They should come and shoot; our CCTV is there live. So that when it starts, they won’t deny it. “It will be relayed live so that when our people’s madness starts, they won’t go back to propaganda and say, ‘it is secession, they are trying to secede.” Kanu has been on the run since 2017, when soldiers raided his father’s residence in Abia.

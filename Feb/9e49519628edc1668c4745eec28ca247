The Lagos State Rapid Response Squad (RRS) on Wednesday warned pupils against living the street lifestyle called ”The Marlian”. “Marlians” are die hard supporters of music star, Naira Marley, real name Afeez Fashola. The Commander, Deputy Commissioner of Police, DCP Olatunji Disu spoke at the “Security Day” Celebration organised by some law enforcement agencies in Lagos on Wednesday. He said Marlian lifestyle is not what a responsible student should copy. “The Marlians also change their natural hairs to dreadlocks, smoke illicit substances and live very rough lifestyles and other abnormal attitudes”, NAN quoted Disu as saying. Disu also advised the pupils not to join ‘Eiye’ and other illegal confraternities and secret cults no matter what they were offering prospective members. “If you join any secret and illegal cult, you are not sure of coming out alive. Moreover, it will affect the entire family system of its members. “The cultists also depend heavily on the use of illicit drugs to drive them high. This has contributed to the high rate of crime in the country,” he said. Disu also advised the pupils not to get carried away by social media distractions. He further urged them to be Be security wise “and remember your parents need you to take care of them at their old ages”.

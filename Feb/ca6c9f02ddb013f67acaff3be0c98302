Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said the club will continue to “suffer” if they miss out on Champions League football again. Solskjaer’s men are currently in fifth position in the Premier League, one point behind fourth-placed Chelsea. Their latest financial figures reflect the effect of no Champions League football at Old Trafford. Broadcasting revenue has dropped by £39million (37 per cent) year on year, while matchday revenue has declined by 15 per cent. Speaking at his press conference on Wednesday, Solskjaer said: “We are a big club, we have got good finances but the longer you are out of it the more you will suffer. “It is an ambition to get back for football reasons and for financial reasons. We have just got to focus on next game.” Man Utd vs Liverpool: Woodward speaks on selecting players for Solskjaer EPL: Solskjaer admits change is needed at Man Utd Man Utd vs Arsenal: McTominay sends message to club over 'sack' of Solskjaer

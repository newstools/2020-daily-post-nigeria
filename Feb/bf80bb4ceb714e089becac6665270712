The governor made this known via his twitter handle when he saw the news of Zubairu trekking for his sake. “Evening, everyone. I came across an interesting tweet indicating that a passionate brother, Usman Zubairu, has embarked on an adventurous trek from Jigawa to Maiduguri in my honour. “I deeply appreciate Malam Usman’s daring support, I strongly appeal that he aborts his courageous mission. To me, he has reached Maiduguri already. “I urge us to put Borno and the rest of Nigeria in our silent prayers. That divine way of support can be more effective “ Zulum twitted. Recalled that Usman Zubairu, the trekker, was yesterday in Damaturu, Yobe state capital en route to Maiduguri, Borno state

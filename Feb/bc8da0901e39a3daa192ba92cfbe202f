Chelsea goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, has decided to fight for his place at Stamford Bridge after manager, Frank Lampard dropped him from the Blues’ Premier League 2-2 draw against Leicester City last weekend. The Spain international was reportedly ‘shocked’ by Lampard’s decision to drop him against the Foxes. According to the UK Sun, Kepa who lost form recently has now decided to work harder in Chelsea’s trainings in a bid to get back his number one position as the Blues’ first-choice goalkeeper. DAILY POST recalls that Lampard opted to go with Willy Caballero instead of Kepa against Brendan Rodgers’ side. Speaking on why he dropped Kepa against Leicester, Lampard said: “It’s a decision I have not taken lightly. “It is a decision I have made, and I think with goalkeepers, it is one I don’t take lightly.” Lampard is reportedly set to go head-to-head with the club’s board over the future of Kepa. Kepa joined Chelsea from Athletic Bilbao £71.6million in 2018.

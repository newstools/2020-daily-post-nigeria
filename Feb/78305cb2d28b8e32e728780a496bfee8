Senator Danjuma La’ah Tella representing Kaduna South Senatorial district has decried the level of marginalisation in terms of educational infrastructure in Kaduna South. The lawmaker, who sponsored a bill for the establishment of Federal University of Science and Technology, Manchok in Kaduna South, expressed optimism that the passage of the bill would bridge the educational gap which the zone suffered over the years. In an exclusive interview with DAILY POST in Abuja, the lawmaker noted that the two Senatorial districts in Kaduna are saturated with tertiary institutions with only two in Southern District, a situation, he maintained, brought about educational backwardness as a result of difficulty in admission. He said the proposed Federal University of Science and Technology was passed into law in the 8th Senate, but had issues with President Muhammadu Buhari’s assent, adding that he was re-presenting the bill in line with Parliamentary traditions. “We haven’t gotten any Federal University or any higher learning institution in that part of the state. Come to think of it, the State has over 45 tertiary institutions, but to tell you my Senatorial district has only two. “The establishment of the University will make sure those who could not secure admission into higher institutions of learning from Southern Kaduna would have advantage of seeking admission. “The bill was passed into law in the 8th National Assembly and was transmitted to President Buhari for his assent, but along the line, it was grouped with Polytechnic bills which didn’t have board of directors and were turned down by Mr. President,” he said. La’ah stressed that there would be no encumbrances to passing the bill into law, saying that it survived in the 8th Senate despite the “no love lost” between the legislature and the executive.

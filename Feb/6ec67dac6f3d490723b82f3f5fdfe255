Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi on Saturday evening made another record following his side’s 5-0 win over Eibar in the La Liga. The Quique Setien’s men defeated Eibar at the Camp Nou, thanks to four goals from Lionel Messi and a strike from Arthur Melo. According to the Opta Jose, Messi’s first-half hat-trick against Eibar means the Barca number has managed to re-write his record sheet with his performance against the visitors. Only against Mallorca in October 2011 did Messi scored an earlier hat-trick (30minutes) than today’s game against Eibar (40minutes) in his professional career. DAILY POST recalls that Messi had earlier this month set a record in his side’s 3-2 win over Real Betis. Messi has now scored 18 goals in the La Liga so far this season. The Argentine captain will now hope to lead Barcelona to victory when they take on Real Madrid in their next La Liga fixture on March 1.

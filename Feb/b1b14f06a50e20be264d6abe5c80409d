Most Rev. Matthew Ishaya-Audu, the Catholic Archbishop-designate of Jos, on Friday bemoaned religious intolerance in Nigeria. He called on citizens to be tolerant of each others’ affiliation and noted that all religions encouraged peace. The cleric who, until his recent appointment, was Bishop of Lafia Diocese for 19 years, made the call on Friday in Lafia during a Mass to mark his 60th birthday and 35th priestly anniversary. Recalling that he had a harmonious relationship with people from other religions for over 35 years, Ishaya-Audu disclosed that some “are not very good people”. “We enjoyed our work together. All religions preach peace and don’t promote violence. Why can’t we obey the tenets of our religions? “If faithfuls of every religion will obey the teachings of their religion, there will be peace in the country,” NAN quoted him as saying. The Bishop thanked God for protecting him while working in His vineyard, in spite of his shortcomings, and vowed to dedicate the rest of his life to serving God and humanity. “There were good moments, bad and trying moments in my journey all this while, but God’s grace and prayers by parishioners kept us going,” the cleric said. Earlier, Monsignor Cletus Gotan, in his Homily, said that most of the perpetrators of evil in the country belonged to religious bodies and appealed to the leaders of the various faithfuls to live above board. In December, the United States listed Nigeria among countries that engage in “violations of religious freedom”. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, said Comoros, Russia, Uzbekistan, Cuba, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and Sudan are on a “Special Watch List” for governments that have engaged in or tolerated “severe violations of religious freedom.” The US re-designated Burma, China, Eritrea, Iran, North Korea, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan as Countries of Particular Concern for having engaged in or tolerated “systematic, ongoing, [and] egregious violations of religious freedom”.

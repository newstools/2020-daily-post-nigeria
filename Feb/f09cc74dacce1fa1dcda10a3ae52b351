A former Liaison Officer of ex-President Shehu Shagari, Tanko Yakasai, has thrown his weight behind calls demanding the sack of current Service Chiefs by President Muhammadu Buhari. Yakasai, who is a founding member of Arewa Consultative Forum, said the current Service Chiefs have run out of ideas on how to resolve the current issue of insecurity in the country. Speaking with Vanguard, Yakasai said Buhari needs to change tactics and seek fresh hands that would help in bringing an end to issues of insecurity in the country. According to Yakasai, the current Service Chiefs are under-qualified to handle the country’s security challenges. He said: “President Buhari was elected by Nigerians and he should listen to them by dropping the service chiefs who have since reached retirement age in the military and appoint new ones with fresh ideas to do the job for which we elected him to do. “The president’s idea about insecurity has proved inadequate to deal with the threat to our lives and property and he should urgently change tactics and personnel in order to win the war against rising threats to the lives of Nigerians. “From what we have seen so far, he has not been able to solve the security problems staring the nation in the face and should seek new hands to help him do the job.” Yakasai’s comment is coming at a time the senate passed a vote of no-confidence on the military, police and other security architecture in the country.

Former Brazil striker, Pele, has dismissed talk he is depressed and reclusive on Thursday. Pele’s son, Edinho, in an interview on Monday, claimed that the three-time World Cup winner was depressed and reluctant to leave his house, because he cannot move properly due to hip problems. However, Pele has come out to insist that he is doing well and maintaining a busy schedule. “I am good. I continue to accept my physical limitations in the best way possible but I intend to keep the ball rolling. “I have good days and bad days. That is normal for people of my age. I am not afraid, I am determined, confident in what I do,” Pele said. Pele who turns 80 in October, has made his recent public appearances in a wheelchair.

The United Kingdom has finally stopped being a member of the European Union. The flags outside embassies were lowered last night as the countdown clocks stopped. This means that Londonâ€™s 47 years of membership of the EU officially ceased at the stroke of 11 pm Friday. This is coming more than three and a half years after a referendum was carried out across Britain. Boris Johnson, British Prime Minister, marked the historic moment with his team at his Downing Street office, according to Al Jazeera. Also, thousands of UK citizens celebrated outside Parliament and groups burned EU flags on the streets of London. Meanwhile, anti-Brexit campaigners mounted several protests along the Irish border. Britain, under the terms of the withdrawal agreement between the UK and EU, now enters a transition period until the end of 2020. This means that London will abide by most EU laws while their future relationship is worked out.

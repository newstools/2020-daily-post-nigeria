The Ogun State Police Command has strongly warned members of the National Association of Nigerian Students not to embark on any protest over the Students Union President of the Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Adegboye Emmanuel Olatunji, who was arrested last week for alleged involvement in cultism. The police threatened that anybody who involved in any protest on Monday, February 17, would face the full weight of the law. DAILY POST reported earlier that the NANS had threatened a showdown with the police, should they fail to stop parading Olatunji as a cultist without charging him to court. Reacting through a statement signed by the state Police Spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi on Sunday, the police said they have intelligence report that some “misguided students” are planning to stage a statewide protest over the issue. According to Oyeyemi, the purpose of the protest was allegedly to disrupt the semester examination commencing in the polytechnic on Monday and to breach public peace. The police said they would not fold their arms and watch those he called “disgruntled elements”, making life unbearable for other law-abiding citizens; saying parents and guardians should warn their children to steer clear of the protest. DAILY POST gathered that all the command’s tactical squads have been activated and deployed to nip any act of violence in the bud. Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Kenneth Ebrimson was said to have ordered the deployment of anti-riot policemen around the polytechnic to protect law-abiding staff and students, stressing that “To be forewarned is to be forearmed.”

The President of Urhobo Youth Council, Comrade Terry Obieh has condoled with the families of those who lost their lives to the alleged attacks, invasion and killings of eight persons in Uwheru Community in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State. Obieh who spoke when some members of his Exco visited him, prayed God to give them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. While condemning the killing of the eight persons by the maraulding herdsmen in Uwheru Communities of Avwon,Agadama and Ohoro, Obieh said,”Fulani herdsmen can not come from the North to kill our people in their own land. Just like that and the authorities are looking on.” Obieh advised the youths of the affected communities not to take laws into their hands by carrying out any reprisal attacks. He urged the youths to be more vigilant as well as work closely with the Police and other sister Security Agencies to forestall re-occurrence of the dastard acts. Obieh also commended Sen. Ovie Omo-Agege and Governor Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa for their timely condemnation of the act but pleaded that it should not just end at that but ensure that the perpetrators are brought to book and made to face the wrath of the law.

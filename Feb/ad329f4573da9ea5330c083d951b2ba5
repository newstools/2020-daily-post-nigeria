Two female suspects have been arrested by the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) for trafficking of babies. NAPTIP said that the suspects were allegedly involved in the sales of a month-old boy delivered by a mad woman. The Lagos State commander of NAPTIP, Mr Daniel Atokolo, confirmed the news on Tuesday during a news conference organised by the agency in Lagos. Atokolo said that the two women were arrested after they were alleged to have been involved in the selling and buying of the baby delivered by a mentally-challenged woman on Jan. 30. ”fresh facts from the agency revealed that it was the fifth time the mentally-deranged mother would be losing her child to the greed of the people around her. ”The agency totally disagrees with Nigerians who may argue that the move is in the interest of the baby. “The agency, therefore, calls on citizens with good intentions to explore legal means of adopting babies. “This crime is punishable by law because the illegal avenues availed unscrupulous elements the opportunity to exploit both women and their young infants, even for ungodly activities such as rituals.” He warned that the agency led by its Director-General, Mrs Dame Okah-Donli, would continue in the fight against human trafficking. “NAPTIP will not relent in its efforts and with all the resources at its disposal to ensure that Nigeria becomes a human trafficking-free naere, ” he added.

Paris Saint-Germain manager, Thomas Tuchel, has refused to blame Neymar for his red card, during their 4-3 win over Bordeaux on Sunday. Neymar was shown a second yellow card for a late challenge on Yacine Adli. The 28-year-old exchanged angry words with referee Willy Delajod as he left the pitch. Tuchel claims Neymar’s reaction was a natural one, given he felt the PSG player had been fouled beforehand by Bordeaux’s Youssouf Sabaly. “We have to talk about the whole situation. “He is nervous and he reacts. It is human. He must not, but it is human. And the Bordeaux player does not even get a yellow card,” Tuchel told the media afterwards. Neymar will now miss PSG’s next Ligue 1 fixture at home to Dijon on Saturday.

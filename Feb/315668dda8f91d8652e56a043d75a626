The Rivers State Executive Council has condemned the protest at the residence of former Governor, Peter Odili, over the Supreme Court judgment that nullified the election of David Lyon as Governor of Bayelsa State. Paulinus Nsirim, Commissioner for Information, in a statement on Wednesday, said the Federal Government seemed “not to show interest in the sponsored threats to the lives of Dr Peter Odili and members of his family.” Rivers Government wondered why Odili’s family should be singled out for the unwarranted attack, when the Beyelsa judgment as a unanimous decision of a five-member panel of Supreme Court Justices. The council warned the “Minister of State for Petroleum, Timipre Sylva and the National Chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole and their hired agents to desist from the sponsorship of violent attacks against Dr Peter Odili and members of his family.” The government said it will hold Sylva and Oshiomhole responsible if anything happens to Dr Peter Odili and members of his family. “The Council noted that in the past Rivers State suffered unfavourable Judicial Pronouncements and never resorted to self help as being promoted by APC Leaders in the case of Bayelsa State. “The Rivers State Government will employ all legal means to protect Dr Peter Odili, members of his family and Rivers State Indigenes who are serving Federal and State Judicial officers . “The Rivers State Government warns that should this harassment and intimidation continue, it will have no alternative than to retaliate,” added.

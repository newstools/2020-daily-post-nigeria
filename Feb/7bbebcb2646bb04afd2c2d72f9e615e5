Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said his time at the club will be seen as a failure, if he does not win the Champions League. Guardiola has won five domestic trophies since taking charge at Etihad Stadium in 2016. These include two back-to-back Premier League titles, the second of which formed part of a domestic treble last campaign. However, Guardiola has failed to recapture his magic on the continent. City have failed to make it past the Champions League quarter-finals in each of his three seasons in charge, losing to Monaco, Liverpool and Tottenham. “We will, of course, not just be judged on the way we play but the titles we win. That is the truth. It is as simple as that,” Guardiola who won the competition twice with Barcelona told reporters. “Last year was an extraordinary one for us but people say, ‘But you didn’t win the Champions League’. That is why I will be judged, if we don’t win it in my final period here, that I will be a failure here. I know that. “But I enjoy working with my players and my players still win a lot of games. Winning a certain way is what helps you to win the titles and we believe we can play that way. We will see at the end.”

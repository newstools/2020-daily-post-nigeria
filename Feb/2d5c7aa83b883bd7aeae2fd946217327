Jema’a Local Government Area of Kaduna State has within January and February 2020 recorded 108 cases of sexual assault. This was contained in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Friday, by a Non-Governmental Organization, Salama Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Kafanchan The centre manager, Mrs Grace Abbin on Friday, said, the breakdown of the figure showed that, of the 108 cases, 19 were rape cases. 219 sexual assault cases were recorded in 2019 when the centre was opened by the state government. According to her, the high figure recorded for the first two months of 2020 was due to awareness campaigns carried out by the centre. “When we started, very few people were coming. It was around October 2019 after we had gone to schools, places of worship and the rest that people started turning out in their numbers to make reports. “We look forward to carrying out more awareness in the media because many people still don’t know about the centre,’’ she said. Her words: ” those affected are mostly women and children, noting that many of the cases are still in court, with four convictions secured in 2019. “Out of the 219 sexual assault cases as at December 2019, the females affected were 190 and the males 29. “We will continue to seek justice for the affected people because without justice, we cannot make progress,’’ she said.

Scores of Nigerians on Saturday scooped fuel from a fallen tanker in Lagos. The tanker turned over near Nigerian Army Bonny Camp barracks in Victoria Island. An eyewitness sent videos of the act to our correspondent on Saturday. The concerned resident said she was disturbed by the sight. “The trailer fell Saturday morning and people have been scooping fuel. The location is inward Ozumba Mbadiwe from Bonny camp in Victoria Island. “In the morning, I passed the area around 10am. There was heavy traffic from V/I to outer parts – CMS, Apogbon, Obalende link road and others. “To my surprise, while returning around 2:30pm, people were still scooping fuel. Even policemen joined. Imagine, those who should chase them, I recorded it. “There’s a fire truck parked there. I don’t know why Nigerians like to risk their lives. Many people, especially, youths are still there”, the witness, a legal practitioner told DAILY POST. Director-General of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, did not take his calls as at press time.

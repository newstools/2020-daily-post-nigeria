The Chief Executive Officer of Manchester City, Ferran Soriano has finally reacted to the UEFA ban on the club. DAILY POST recalls that Pep Guardiola’s side were handed a two-season ban from the Champions League and Europa League last Friday. Man City were found to have seriously breached their club licensing and financial fair play regulations. Reacting to the development, Soriano said UEFA’s allegations to ban Man City are not valid. “The fans can be sure of two things,” Soriano told Man City’s official website on Wednesday. “The first one is that the allegations are false. And the second is that we will do everything that can be done to prove so. “The most important thing I have to say today is that the allegations are not true. They are not true.”

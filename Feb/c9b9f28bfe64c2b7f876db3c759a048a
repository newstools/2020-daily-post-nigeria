Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, on Sunday reacted to the travel ban imposed on Nigeria by the United States, US. Adeboye while addressing his members during a special service at the church’s headquarters in Ebute Meta, Lagos State, asked God to restore Nigeria back to her full glory. Recall that the US had announced travel restrictions on immigrant visas for Nigerians and five other countries due to their inability to effectively fight terrorism. US President, Donald Trump had signed the proclamation on Friday and it’s expected to take effect from February 22, 2020. However, Adeboye, who is the General Overseer of RCCG told his members: “Some countries have banned Nigerians from coming into their territories. We pray for the restoration of our nation. Lord, have mercy on Nigeria. “Let there be peace and security in Nigeria. God sees all things and knows where the terrorists are hiding. We pray that God sends His light to Nigeria and expose the evildoers in the country.”

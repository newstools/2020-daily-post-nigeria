Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has again lashed out at VAR officials, following their 2-1 win over Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday. Spurs playmaker, Lo Celso, escaped a red card for a stamp on Cesar Azpilicueta in the second half. VAR official, David Coote, decided that the player had accidentally stepped on Azpilicueta. Lampard, who also saw Harry Maguire escape a sending off for a stamp on Michy Batshuayi, earlier this week, told BBC: “It is not good enough, that is two VARs in two games. “It is hard to shout about it when you have lost but today everybody saw that. It is a red. “I hate to call for red cards but that is a leg breaker. I am not saying about referees on the spot, VAR is here to clear things up and it is not good enough.”

Nigeria has been described as the most complex country in the world especially in terms of religious, ethnic and cultural diversities. A retired Senior Foreign Officer from the United States of America, Dr Atim Eneida George, stated this in a keynote address at a Round Table Discussion on Voting Rights organised by the National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies ( NILDS). George said even though Nigeria has a complex situation; the country can benefit from her diversity by ensuring inclusiveness in governance. Governance according to her , is much too important to be left solely to government alone. Citizens must get involved. Dr George who served as the Senior Foreign Service Officer of USA in Nigeria from 2002 to 2009 admonished Nigerians to exercise their voting rights at all times for good governance. Earlier in his opening remarks at the occasion, the Director General of NILDS, Professor Abubakar Sulaiman, said the round table discussion was organised to further deepen the practice of democracy in the country .

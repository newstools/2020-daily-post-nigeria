Dalian Professional striker, Salomon Rondon, has claimed he was close to joining Manchester United last month. United were in the market for a frontman, after Marcus Rashford was ruled out for four months with a back problem. Red Devils boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, also tried to bring in Josh King from Bournemouth, but eventually decided on Odion Ighalo. Rondon says he waited for a phone call from his agent for an update on negotiations, before finding out about the Ighalo deal. “They started to talk to my agent and I was just waiting by my phone for a decision, maybe for the lawyers, but then I saw Ighalo had signed. “It didn’t get to the stage where an offer was made or anything like that, but I think it was really close. “It’s decisions again and they obviously decided Ighalo was the best decision for them. I’ve played against him and I’m pleased for him,” the 30-year-old told The Athletic. Rondon previously played in England with Newcastle, where he scored 11 goals in 32 Premier League appearances.

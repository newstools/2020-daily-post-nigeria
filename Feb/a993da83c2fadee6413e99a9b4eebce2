The lawmaker representing Egbeda/Ona Ara Federal Constituency of Oyo State, Akin Alabi, has announced that he will sponsor a bill to make military camouflage legal for civilian use. The lawmaker made the announcement on his Twitter page. He stated that he would be putting a law together to repeal section 110 of the criminal code. “Section 110(1), Criminal Code states that it is illegal for a nonmilitary person to wear the uniform of the armed forces, or any part of the uniform of such forces, or any dress having the appearance or bearing any of the regimental or other distinctive marks of such uniforms,” he said. Alabi in his thread, described the existing law as archaic. He argued further that military personnel loves to use the law to abuse civilians.
The tweets read, “So the law is clear. Do not wear camouflage. But does the law make sense? I’m sure some people will argue it does. Many will say it doesn’t. I’m one of those that say it doesn’t and I thought it would make a lot of sense to repeal that law. “Not only is it an archaic law, one major reason I believe the law has to be repealed is that many soldiers ride on the law to abuse the rights Nigerians. We have heard numerous cases of Nigerians being beaten for wearing the camouflage. “I decided to put together a bill so we can repeal this law but I gathered that a distinguished Senator has already submitted a similar bill. I will be waiting for its progress. If nothing happens in a few months, I will push mine. For now, I wait.”

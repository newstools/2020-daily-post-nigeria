An angry mob has burnt a middle-aged man identified as Victor to death in the early hours of Tuesday. The incident occurred at about 5am on Tuesday along Abitu Avenue by Ekpo Edem Street in Calabar South local government area of Cross River State. An eye witness who gave his name as George Asuquo said the victim was in the habit of stealing petty things in the area. “The victim has been in the habit of stealing things like car battery, generators and livestock including chickens in the neighbourhood, but people have become wiser. “He never knew that word has gotten out about his illicit activities in the area. Although when he was caught last year by vigilante he was given the last warning which he obviously did not heed to. “He came as usual in the early hours of Tuesday to steal some chicken but the chicken started making noise and alerted people that something was not right that was when they knew an intruder was in the environment. “The people mobilised and laid siege for him, he was apprehended at about 4:00 am, the people refused to let him off the hook this time, hence they didn’t wait for too long before beating him up and setting him ablaze for the fowl he stole,” Asuquo said. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Irene Ugbo who confirmed the report said it was unfortunate that such a barbaric act happened again in Calabar. Irene had earlier warned members of the public to desist from taking laws into their hands by handing over suspects to the police. “We are not supporting criminals and their activities, but people must understand that jungle justice is against the law, they should hand over suspects to the police for further investigation and prosecution,” she said.

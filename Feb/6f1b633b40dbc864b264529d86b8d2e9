A former Presidential candidate of National Action Council (NAC), Dr. Olapade Agoro has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to without wasting time, convene a National Security Parley. Agoro said that this was necessary in order to rescue the country from the spate of insecurity. Agoro in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Friday in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital, maintained that there was no doubt that Nigeria needed to convoke a National Security Parley to fashion out possible solution to the various security challenges confronting the country. While emphasizing that the present security situation on ground in Nigeria was beyond mere sacking the nation’s security chiefs, Agoro stressed that the National Security Parley will go a long way in bringing about the much needed possible way out of the challenges of insecurity in and across the nook and cranny of the country. Agoro said, “With the alarming notorious security challenges facing the nation like the highly embarrassing attack of Otuoke home of former President Goodluck Jonathan and killing of his security Aide, the inhuman, wicked and heinous killing of Rev Lawan Andimi, there is an urgent need for convocation of national security parley to sincerely address how we got to where we are and how to get out of the mess. “For President Buhari to now suddenly wake up from his day dreaming to “express surprise at the level of insecurity across the nation under his watch” must explain to us that the ship of state is drifting aimlessly to end of no return.
“It behooves to say out loudly that if a retired four stars Military General could only lead the government with lame hands on the alarming security situations of this country and with more than three more years to go, what hope can we have as a people for the future of our children. “Sacking the Service Chiefs is not the best since those to replace them may after all be birds of same feathers”.

Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje has banned street begging by children known as Almajiris. The order was contained in a statement on Tuesday by Abba Anwar, his spokesman. Ganduje gave the order during the launching of Basic Education Service Delivery for All (BESDA) and Distribution of Offer of Appointment to 7,500 volunteer teachers, held at Sani Abacha Stadium. He said the decision was to fully consolidate the free and compulsory primary and secondary schools education in Kano. The government added that the directive would integrate the Almajiri system into the policy and address the lingering problem of street begging. The statement warned any Almijiri teacher thinks he cannot accept the new policy to leave the state. “When Almajiri are caught begging, it is not only that beggar is caught, but his parents or guardians. “Such parents or guardians would be taken to court to face the wrath of the law,” Ganduje was quoted as saying.

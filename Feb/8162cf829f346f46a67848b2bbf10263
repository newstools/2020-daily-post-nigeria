In his contribution, Senator Emmanuel Bwacha reminded the red Chambers that the “Federal University of Medical Sciences, Otukpo”, has passed through legislative debate in the 8th Senate, adding that there is no need wasting time in approving the bill. Senator James Ebiowo Manager representing Delta South added that the former Senate President should be compensated while urging lawmakers to support the bill. “Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, those of us in the 8th Senate who are here contributed in support of the bill, which was sponsored by Senator David Mark. There is a need for us to compensate him and I want us to support the bill. ” Senate President Dr Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan in his remarks urged the Senate leader to expedite action on the bill as well as other bills that were not assented by President Muhammadu Buhari. “He said: ” when this bill was brought before the 8th Senate and as Senate leader, I saw the need for us to pass the bill and we all supported it. “The sponsor of the bill, Senator David Mark served as Senate President meritoriously and there is a need for us to just pass the bill. “I also want to maintain that Mr. President has approved the establishment of the institution and also I want to suggest that we take away public hearing that would cost us expenses. Lawan urged the Senate leader to take note and to also look at other bills that were not assented by President Muhammadu Buhari so that could be expeditiously worked up on.

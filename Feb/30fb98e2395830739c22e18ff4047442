An Italian-Nigerian footballer, King Paul Akpan Udoh has contracted the Covid-19, also known as Coronavirus. He becomes the first football player to be infected with coronavirus. He currently plays with Pianese, an Italian division 3 side. The footballer was diagnosed of the disease yesterday and has been quarantined. The 22-year-old, who started his football career with Reggiana, moved to Juventus in 2011 where he was loaned back for a year. Udoh later joined Virtus Lanciano, a Serie B side in 2016 on loan but returned to Juve after failing to express. Juventus shipped him to Lega Pro side Pontedera later the same year. He had a loan stint with Pontedera, Fernana, Fano and Viareggio before joining Pianese on July 14, 2019. The Covid-19 virus has spread from China to countries in Europe, the Middle East, the Americas and Africa. Just yesterday, an Italian from Milan was diagnosed of the disease in Lagos, Nigeria. The World Health Organisation, WHO, has warned that if nothing is done, the disease will reach everything country on the planet. Catholic pontiff, Pope Francis has been declared sick with an unspecified illness after he met with the virus on the Ash Wednesday service.

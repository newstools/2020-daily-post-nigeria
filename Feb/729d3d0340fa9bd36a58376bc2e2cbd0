Inter Milan winger Victor Moses, has revealed why his side was beaten 1-0 by Napoli in the Coppa Italia semi-final first leg encounter on Wednesday night at the San Siro. Napoli defeated Inter Milan, thanks to Fabian Ruiz Pena’s second-half strike. But Moses believes Antonio Conte’s men were tired during the match following their 3-2 victory over AC Milan in Serie A on Sunday. “We were kind of tired after the match against AC Milan on Sunday,” Moses told Inter TV after the match. “We are upset at the outcome, but Inter needs to start winning again in our next match and look forward. “We will try to improve against Lazio in our next fixture and do our best, but we are disappointed with today’s result. “Football in Italy is so tactical, we have a fantastic manager [Conte], and my goal is to help my teammates on the pitch always.”

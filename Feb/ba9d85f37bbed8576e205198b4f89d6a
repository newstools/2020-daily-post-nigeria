The House of Representatives has rejected a motion to evacuate stranded Nigerians in China due to Coronavirus epidemic. The motion was moved by Ben Kalu from Abia State under a motion of urgent public importance. The lawmakers, however, rejected the motion due to the title of the motion which reads: “Urgent need to evacuate Nigerians stranded in China” There was a mild drama as the members chanted “no no that is not true” Appeal by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila to placate the members yielded no fruit as members continue d to murmur “that’s not the situation of things” The mover of the motion, Kalu therefore stepped down the motion.

Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has reacted to trending video of Borno residents booing President Muhammadu Buhari. In the viral video, DAILY POST reported that hundreds of Borno residents booed Buhari and his entourage on arrival in the state on a “sympathy visit”. The resident shouted “Ba ma so, ba ma yi” in Hausa language which means “We don’t want, we are not interested” in English. They booed Buhari’s convoy as they passed. The President arrived Maiduguri following the killing of 30 persons in Auno by Boko Haram insurgents. The terrorists stormed the village at about 9:50 pm on Sunday and abducted some persons. Omokri, sharing the video on his Twitter page inferred that the actions of Borno residents had vindicated Goodluck Jonathan. According to him, Jonathan during his time was never booed during his visit several times to Borno State. “You wouldn’t believe what Maiduguri residents did to Buhari. “Today, I exclusively released a video of General Buhari being booed in Maiduguri, which the media syndicated. Ex President Jonathan visited Borno nine times and was never booed,“ he wrote. Omokri recalling the results from 2019 presidential election, queried the authenticity of the figures. “Do you still believe Buhari won Borno by 836,496 votes, to Atiku’s 81,778 votes,“ Omokri added.

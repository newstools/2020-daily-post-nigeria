The Nasarawa State House of Assembly on Monday, called on security agencies to intensify efforts toward the quick release of abducted Permanent Secretary, Ministry for Works, Alhaji Jibrin Giza. Recall that gunmen on Sunday kidnapped Alhaji Jibrin Giza, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Works in Nasarawa State. Mr Bola Longe, the state Commissioner of Police in the state, who confirmed the incident, said that Giza was abducted by gunmen from his residence at Shabu, a suburb of Lafia at about 12:40 am., to an unknown destination. Reacting, Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi, the Speaker of the Assembly while reading the House resolution, sympathised with Nasarawa state government, the permanent secretary’s family and Keana Local Government over the abduction. The matter came up after Mr Daniel Ogazi, the deputy Majority Leader brought the issue under matters of public interest in Lafia. While commending the efforts of the security agencies in combating crimes in the state, he urged them to step up efforts to ensure the quick release of the permanent secretary unharmed. “What is happening in our state is actually uncalled for as security is the primary responsibility of every government. “The kidnap of the permanent secretary is unfortunate and up till now there is no communication between the kidnappers and the government or the permanent secretary’s family. “We share the pains with His Excellency, Gov. Abdullahi Sule and the family of the abducted permanent Secretary over the unfortunate incident, as we also pray for his quick release unharmed,” NAN quoted him as saying.

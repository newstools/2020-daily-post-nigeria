Vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the last general election, Peter Obi, has revealed ways to tackle insecurity in the country. Obi who maintained that the state of insecurity in the Buhari-led administration was the worst ever, urged the government to focus on reversing the loss of jobs. He tweeted on Monday, “The state of insecurity under this administration is the worst the country has ever experienced. “To address it, we need to look at the economy and focus on reversing the loss of jobs, among other solutions.” Recall that On Sunday, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye alongside his members held a protest against insecurity situation in the country. They started the march at about 11am shortly after the church service at RCCG’s National Headquarters in Ebute Metta, Lagos State. Also, the senate minority leader Enyinnaya Abaribe had last week while contributing to a motion on insecurity on the floor of the Senate, called for Buhari’s resignation, over the high level of insecurity witnessed across the country.

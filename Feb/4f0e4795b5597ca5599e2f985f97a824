The Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Obafemi Hamzat, has said that the law banning motorcycles and tricycles in the state, has been in existence since 2012. Hamzat stated this when he appeared on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Wednesday. The operations of commercial motorcycles and tricycles were banned in six local government areas and nine local council developments. Hamzat denied that the ban was targeted at anyone or group. “The truth of the matter is that it is a law that has been in existence since 2012. It was revised by the past administration in 2018. So, it is a law that has been there for like nine, 10 years. “We all know that it was not implemented; so what we are doing is to implement the law. It’s not that we just woke up and banned them. It is about the security of lives,” he said. Hamzat added that the rate of accidents recorded from okadas has reduced significantly since the government implemented the ban.

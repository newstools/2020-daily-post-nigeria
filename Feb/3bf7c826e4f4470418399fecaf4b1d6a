Cristiano Ronaldo on Saturday, became the first Juventus player to score in 10 straight Serie A games. Ronaldo opened scoring as the Italian champions lost 2-1 at Hellas Verona. After celebrating his 35th birthday earlier in the week, the Portugal captain fired low into the bottom left corner. That goal meant Ronaldo has now scored in 10 consecutive Serie A games, taking his tally to 20. In 2005, David Trezeguet netted in nine straight domestic matches for Juve. His effort was however not enough for victory, as Fabio Borini and Giampaolo Pazzini ensured the hosts took all three points. Inter Milan will now go top if they beat AC Milan in Sundayâ€™s Derby.

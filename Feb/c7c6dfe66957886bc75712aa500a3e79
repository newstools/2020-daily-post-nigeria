Former Tottenham Hotspur manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has said he is ready to manage in the Premier League again. Pochettino, 47, has been out of work, since he was sacked at White Hart Lane in November 2019. Pochettino has been constantly linked with the Manchester United job, even while he was still at Spurs. Speaking on In The Pink podcast, the Argentine tactician expressed his confidence that his “next challenge will be fantastic”. “To be honest, I would love to work in the Premier League,” he said. “It’s going to be difficult, I know, and for now it’s a moment to wait and we’ll see what happens. “It’s a moment of recovery, to think about yourself a little bit, and to be ready because in football always something can happen and you need to be ready. “I’m ready and waiting for a new challenge. I have the belief and confidence that the next challenge will be fantastic.”

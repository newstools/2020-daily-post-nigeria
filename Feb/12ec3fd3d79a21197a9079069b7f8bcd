Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed that forward, Heung-Min Son, is set to undergo surgery this week after sustaining a fracture to his right arm during their Premier League 3-2 against Aston Villa last weekend. Spurs disclosed this in a statement on their official website on Tuesday ahead of their UEFA Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie against RB Leipzig on Wednesday. “Heung-Min Son will undergo surgery this week after he suffered a fracture to his right arm,” the club’s statement read. “The South Korean forward picked up the injury during Tottenham’s 3-2 win over Aston Villa in Sunday’s Premier League encounter. “After the surgery, our medical staff shall be reviewing management options for Son’s rehabilitation with the player expected to be out of action for a number of weeks.” Son has been impressive for Mourinho’s side so far this season. The 27-year-old also scored twice for Tottenham against Aston Villa on Sunday.

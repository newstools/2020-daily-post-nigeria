The governorship candidate of the Allied Peoples Movement (APM), Hon. Adekunle Akinlade has sympathised with those who were mistakenly shot by policemen at Olomore market in Abeokuta on Thursday, praying God to grant them quick recovery. Akinlade, who is now a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), also sympathised with the family of a footballer, Kazeem Tiyamiyu, who died yesterday during an encounter with a police officer of the Zonal Intervention Squad, along Sagamu-Abeokuta highway, saying may God give them the fortitude to bear the loss. The former lawmaker called on the people of Ogun State and APC faithful to be patient and calm in the face of the recent shootings and killings across the state. In a statement made available to DAILY POST by his Media Aide, Azeez Adelani, on Sunday, Akinlade specifically appealed to the families of the Remo footballer to remain calm. Akinlade further stated that “it was imperative that we remain patient with good attitude, while we wait on God’s deliverance. “Like every situation and experience, this dark cloud hanging over Ogun State will blow over and the people will have the good leadership they crave. “We must not allow our distractors to see our pain nor rejoice over our loss, rather we must show courage and good attitude as we await God’s divine glory. “Breakdown of law and order across the state is a reflection of LEADERSHIP.”

A former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has reacted to the killing of over 30 people in Maiduguri yesterday by the Boko Haram terrorists.
The attack happened at Auno, along the Maiduguri – Damaturu road, leaving 30 people killed and 18 vehicles destroyed. The terrorists stormed the area at about 9:50pm on Sunday. Borno state governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum has since visited the scene of the attack. However, those who followed the governor and other security sources confirmed that aside the 30 people that were killed in the attack, the insurgents abducted passengers in three buses. Atiku said Nigeria must be united to fight this common enemy, adding that all possible options must be explored to bring this incessant killing to stop “We can’t afford to stay divided in the face of this common enemy. I sympathise with the bereaved families. These incidents, one too many, should make us explore all possible options to put a stop to this scourge,” he tweeted.

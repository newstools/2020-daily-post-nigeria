He said some of the suspects owned up to their crimes which include identity theft, romance scam and online bitcoin trading scam, among others. “Information gathered from the suspects shows that they prowl social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, from where they dupe unsuspecting Nigerians and oversea victims. “Items recovered from them include Toyota Venza, Lexus and Mercedes Benz cars, mobile phones and laptops”, Orilade added.

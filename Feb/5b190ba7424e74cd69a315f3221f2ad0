The organised labour in Adamawa State has given the government until February 17 to conclude negotiations on how much senior civil servants will earn as minimum wage. Although, Adamawa became one of the first states to begin implementation of minimum wage, the implementation was for only junior civil servants (on levels 1-6), with understanding that senior civil servants (from level 7 upwards) would start getting theirs on conclusion of consequential adjustment talks. The organised labour has resolved, however, that it is not satisfied with how the government has been handling the talks. The Chairman of the state Joint Negotiation Council (Trade Union Side), Muhammed Tuki, who confirmed the development, drew attention of DAILY POST to a bulletin on the outcome of a meeting of trade unions in the state. The Adamawa State Chapter of the Organised Labour said in the bulletin obtained Wednesday evening that although the Trade Union Side of the Joint Negotiation Council of the state spent time and resources in talks with the government side of the council, the government gave no regards to agreements reached. The Organised Labour said in its bulletin that it is aware of a pledge by the government to implement minimum wage for senior civil servants by February ending, but it would not accept the offer the government had come up with. The bulletin reads in part, “The Organised Labour dissociates itself from the state government’s offer and avers that negotiation be concluded and agreement reached and signed to include all local government staff, local education authority staff and primary health workers.” The Organised Labour, which comprises the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and the State Joint Negotiation Council, said in its Bulletin that it had resolved to give the state government a grace period of up to “the closing hours of 17th February.” It warned that the government has that much time to conclude negotiation with full mandate, which would culminate into the signing of a collective bargaining document, “or else industrial peace and harmony will not be guaranteed in the state.”

Guests at the valedictory session in honour of a retired Judge, Justice Ifiok Ukana in the Ministry of Justice Akwa Ibom State were on Tuesday shocked when he rejected a valedictory gift presented to him by the State Chief Judge (CJ), Godwin Abraham at the Judiciary Multipurpose hall, Uyo, the state capital. Justice Ukana, who rejected the plaque of honour, complained that he was neglected and victimized for two years because of a case he presided against a politician in the state. He added that government in a way to punish him, denied him several amenities that could enhance his duty. Although Justice Ukana (retired,) never mentioned the name of the politician and the political party involved in the case in question, he said his court lacked electricity and he worked for six months without light in his office. “I suffered for two years without necessary incentives to my office as a Judge. My court never had light for six months. I was victimized. Nothing to celebrate here,” he lamented. He, however, thanked the Akwa Ibom State Judiciary, the entire members of the Bench, the Bar and the general public for finding him worthy of the celebration. He also stressed on the need for absolute independence of the judiciary since it (judiciary) is the last hope of the common man. Meanwhile, the state Chief Judge, Justice Godwin Abraham who never made any remark concerning the allegations, said Government has put everything in place to encourage Judiciary Officers in the state. He said, “Government is committed to good working environment of law officers and would not relent doing so.” Akwa Ibom Court jails Archibong over N28m fraud Akpabio distances self from bribery allegations against tribunal judges Gov.

A Chinese woman from Wuhan has infected her five relatives living in Anyang with Coronavirus. Chinese scientists reported on Friday that the 20-year-old never showed signs of infection. Reuters reports that a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, evidenced that the virus can be spread asymptomatically. The case also suggests that Coronavirus may be hard to stop. In the publication, Dr. Meiyun Wang of the People’s Hospital of Zhengzhou University and colleagues narrated the woman’s case. They noted that when the relatives fell ill, doctors isolated the visiting woman and tested her for Coronavirus. Although she tested negative initially, a follow-up test was positive. Shockingly, even when all five family members developed COVID-19 pneumonia, the young woman still had not developed any symptoms one month later. “Scientists have been asking if you can have this infection and not be ill? The answer is apparently, yes,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Over 75,567 cases of the virus, which had spread to 26 countries, has been reported including 2,239 deaths.

Former Governorship candidate of the Allied People’s Movement (APM) in Ogun State, Hon. Adekunle Akinlade, had on Saturday appealed to all indigenes of Ogun state to support the present administration of Gov Dapo Abiodun with prayers. Akinlade urged that everyone in the state should contribute one way or the other to move the state forward. DAILY POST reports that the former House of Representatives member made this request during the Year 2020 inaugural meeting of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ipokia Local Government, held at the Onipokia Palace Square. “We cannot engage in rivalry, abuses or anything that brings retrogression to our dear state. We have to pray for them (the Abiodun administration) to succeed, as this is not about differences in party, caucus or ideology, but about Ogun State. We have just one Ogun state”, Akinlade stated. The Agosasa-born politician spoke further that as someone who still wishes to govern the state, he would love to govern an Ogun State everybody would be proud of. Akinlade appreciated the people of Ipokia for standing firm behind him before, during and after the last election, which ended with the Supreme Court’s verdict. He appreciated them for their doggedness and love, while urging them to remain steadfast and united. At the meeting, special prayers were observed in honour of the former Ogun Majority Leader, Late Yinka Mafe, who died on his 46th birthday on Tuesday.

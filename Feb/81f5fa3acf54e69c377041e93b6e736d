President Muhammadu Buhari says exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union has set the stage for a new trade regime between the UK and its old partners, as well as an alignment with new trading partners. This was contained in his statement Monday night by his spokesman, Garba Shehu. It recalled that understanding the inevitability of the situation, Buhari had earlier stated the opportunities presented by Nigeria and indeed other nations of the Commonwealth in the emerging trade scenario occasioned by the Brexit. “It is, therefore, heart-warming that Prime Minister Boris Johnson also believes that indeed, a new dawn awaits the United Kingdom in its trade relationship with countries within the Commonwealth, Nigeria inclusive as reflected in his speech earlier Monday in Greenwich. “President Buhari, while writing on, A new case for a Commonwealth based on trade, on the eve of the ‘UK- Africa Investment Summit’ in London in January, had said: “I – like many other Commonwealth leaders – also seek a new settlement: not only of closer relations between the UK and my own nation, but of unleashing trade within the club in which we together shall remain. “With a population of nearly 200 million made of largely of vibrant and energetic young men and women brimming with ideas, and being the largest economy in Africa, Nigeria looks forward to a trade engagement with the United Kingdom which will undoubtedly present for Nigeria and indeed the Commonwealth a mutually benefiting dawn.” President Buhari further expressed optimism towards the forthcoming Commonwealth meeting in June.

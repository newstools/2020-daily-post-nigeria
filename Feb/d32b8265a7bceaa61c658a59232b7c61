The Coordinator, Operation Safe Corridor (OPSC), Maj.-Gen Bamidele Shafa, has debunked reports that repentant members of “Boko Haram” have been enrolled into the Nigeria military. Shafa in an interview with newsmen after a visit to the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, explained that the military is a professional body, which abides strictly to rules and regulations regarding recruitment. He added that to be recruited into the army, “You must be a Nigerian, must not have been convicted of any offence, and must not have been a members of any proscribed organisation. “None of the 280 boys that graduated from the OPSC is recruited into the Nigerian military. “We have our criteria for recruitment. To be recruited, you must be a Nigerian, must not have been convicted of any offence, and must not have been a members of any proscribed organisation. “So, considering the criteria, none of these boys has been recruited into the military. “OPSC just finished its follow-up into the communities and these boys are doing very well. None of them is in the military.” He further assured Nigerians that none of these boys has been recruited and will not be recruited in the future, NAN reports.

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang can be convinced to sign a new deal at the club. Aubameyang scored twice as the Gunners battled to a 3-2 win over Everton on Sunday. However, the Gabon striker will have only one year left on his current, when this season is over. Aubameyang has been linked with Barcelona, Real Madrid and Inter Milan. But Arteta says he could yet remain at the Emirates. “They (other teams) are completely right to want him because he’s a superb player. He completely deserves to be liked by other teams but hopefully, we can convince him that this is the right place for him. And he has a future here. “You know he wants to play for the biggest club in the biggest tournament and be up there with the best players in the world. “And we have to try and support him and give him everything at the club so he really feels fulfilled here. That’s the challenge I have,” Arteta told reporters after the game.

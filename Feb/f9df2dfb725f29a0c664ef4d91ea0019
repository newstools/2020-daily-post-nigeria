An official of the Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA) has reportedly committed suicide. His lifeless body was found on Saturday, dangling at Opebi near the popular Adebola House. Identified as Akinde, the deceased was recently redeployed from his Alausa unit. A source told The Nation that Akinde had been battling with mental illness. “We don’t know what could have led to the incident. He was working at Alausa before his new posting. He did not hide his intention of not happy with the posting. “Though, he was suffering from mental illness, I think only those closer to him knew that. It was a big tragedy for the LASTMA family, ” the source said. Meanwhile, efforts to reach LASTMA spokesman, Olufemi Filade, proved abortive as at press time.

Manchester United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has said this summer will be an “important opportunity” for the club to rebuild. Woodward, speaking at a fans’ forum, admitted that they “are not yet where we want to be”. United occupy the eighth position in the Premier League, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men struggling for consistency this season. During the meeting, Woodward warned that the process might not be smooth, but assured the club remains committed to achieving their aims. According to him, work is being done to strengthen the academy, recruitment process and scouting network. “Significant work has already been done – and investments made – to strengthen the academy and we’re pleased with the progress being made behind-the-scenes to ensure we have the right players, the right infrastructure, and the right culture to sustain long-term success. “Similarly, there has been extensive work on our recruitment process, with considerable investment in scouting, data and analytics. The recruitment department is working to a clear plan and philosophy, along with Ole and his coaching staff. “Our focus is on bringing in a combination of experience and the best young players with potential to develop further, fusing graduates from our academy with high-quality acquisitions,” Woodward said in remarks read at the meeting. United were only able to sign Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon in January and brought in Odion Ighalo from Shanghai Shenhua on loan until the end of this season.

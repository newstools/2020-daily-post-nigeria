Ekiti State Government has resolved to pay the May/June 2020 West African Examination Council (WAEC) fees of the SS3 Students in public secondary schools in the state with the approval of the sum of N248,522,900. The said amount was approved for the enrollment of 14, 242 final year students who are to sit for the May/June WAEC examination. Some 13,390 SS3 candidates in Public Secondary Schools in the State last year, had their WAEC fees offset by the State Government which released over N227 Million for their registration. This came as the state government warned school principals and registrars of all Public Secondary Schools across the state, against the collection of any fees not approved by the Government from students. The State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mr Foluso Daramola who disclosed this in Ado-Ekiti on Wednesday, said the government was committed to making education accessible to all and sundry in the state regardless of their origin and status. Daramola, therefore, called on parents and guardians to always make the education of their children a priority in the scheme of things. He noted the government had in the year 2019, procured 52,000 units of School furniture for Public Secondary Schools across the State as part of efforts aimed at providing basic Infrastructural facilities in schools. The Commissioner stressed that the state government had also paid running grants to all Public Primary and Secondary Schools in the state, adding that, about N5 million was being released as monthly feeding and maintenance grants to 3 Special Schools in the State. He said the state government would continue to do the needful in the education sector, despite the limited resources at the disposal of the State. The Commissioner, however, called on individuals, philanthropists and Corporate Organizations to contribute to the educational development of the state through the institution of scholarship awards for brilliant but indigent students.

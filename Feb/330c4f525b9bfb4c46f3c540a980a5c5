Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has claimed Chelsea are the favourites to finish in the top four. Mourinho, who had two stints as Blues boss, takes his side to Stamford Bridge in the Premier League on Saturday. The two teams are separated by just a point before kick-off, with Sheffield United and Manchester United just behind. Wolves, Everton and Arsenal are all also mathematically in the hunt for Champions League places. “At this moment, Tottenham, Manchester United, Arsenal, Sheffield United, Wolverhampton, Everton – we are the underdogs. “We have ambitions to be there but we are one, two, three points behind Chelsea, so they have an advantage to all of us. That’s obvious. It’s not a big advantage but it is an advantage. “Chelsea in this moment is favourite for the fourth position, considering Leicester has nine points more at this stage of the season,” Mourinho told a press conference on Friday.

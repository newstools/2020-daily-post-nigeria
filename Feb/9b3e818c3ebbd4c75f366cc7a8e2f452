Unai Emery has slammed the attitude of Arsenal players. The Spaniard, speaking with France Football, claimed some members of the Gunners squad “asked for more than what they were giving back”. Emery was fired in November 2019, just 18 months after he replaced Arsene Wenger at the Emirates. The former Sevilla and PSG manager failed to win in his last seven fixtures and has now pointed fingers at some of the players. “We had Champions League qualification in our grasp and it went wrong in the end. “But it was a good season and we had this notion of continuing to improve,” he said. The 48-year-old also highlighted the exits of several key players, as one of the reasons for the instability in the team. “But we lost our four captains: [Laurent] Koscielny, [Petr] Cech, [Aaron] Ramsey and [Nacho] Monreal. They were personalities that we missed this season to stay on the right track. “And some players did not have a good attitude and asked for more than what they were giving back. “Taking all of that into account, we needed time to succeed with our transition to a new Arsenal which is what I wanted,” Emery said.

The House of Representatives has urged the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) to arrest and prosecute people using paracetamol to cook meat and others using bleach to process cassava. The House reached the resolution following the consideration of a motion on matter of urgent importance moved by Dozie Nwankwo on Thursday. Nwankwo stated that there was occurrence of such practice in Osun State. He said that “practice of using bleach and paracetamol on food products is highly detrimental to human health.” The House, therefore, resolved to urge the Ministry of Health to ensure that a blueprint for practices in the public food sector was available to the public for implementation. It mandated the committee on Healthcare Services to ensure compliance.

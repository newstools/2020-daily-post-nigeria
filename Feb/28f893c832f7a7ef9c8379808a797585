Wife of the President, Aisha Buhari, on Monday, warned that Nigeria may face worse security problems. She, therefore, called for synergy among all security agencies. Aisha urged them to re-strategize and re-examine the security structure with a view to stem the rising cases of terrorism in Nigeria. She made the call at an international conference on state and security held at the Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA) Kaduna. Aisha Buhari urged government to look into the welfare of security personnel. “Security in Nigeria remains the biggest challenge, it is high time to explore new strategies and approaches. “If care is not taken, we will be expecting the worse of the security problems we are facing in Nigeria,” NAN quoted her as saying. The First Lady appealed to Nigerians to remain vigilant and provide relevant information to security agencies to avert any potential threat. “All criminals are members of our society and they live in our midst, parents have the responsibility of ensuring that we take exceptional interest in the development of our children”, Aisha said.

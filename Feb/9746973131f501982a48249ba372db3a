The Criminal Court sitting in Macca, Saudi Arabia, has finally discharged and acquitted Malam Ibrahim Ibrahim. This followed a strong defence constituted by Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle and dispatched to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ensure his discharge and acquittal in the case that came up yesterday in Macca. According to a statement signed by the Special Adviser to Governor Matawalle, Hon Zailani Bappa and made available to newsmen in Gusau, the state capital, Ibrahim Ibrahim, is a renowned Islamic cleric from Zamfara State, wrongly accused of drug trafficking in Saudi Arabia who was on the death row. “Leader of the team to Saudi Arabia, Zamfara State Commissioner of Special Duties, Alhaji Mohammed Saddiq Maiturare broke the news early this morning from Macca and said Ibrahim was now a free man,” Bappa said. The statement pointed out that it would be recalled that Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle had earlier met with President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene in the matter who in turn, instructed the Minister of Justice to handle the matter. “It was, however, evident that Ibrahim Ibrahim required the services of advocates which Governor Bello Mohammed swiftly handled by employing a team of lawyers for Ibrahim and constituted a delegation, including a lawyer (representing the National Commission on Diaspora) from the Federal Ministry of Justice, to Saudi Arabia to monitor the proceeding” “With this development, any moment from now, Malam Ibrahim Ibrahim will be flown back to Nigeria and be reunited with his family and relatives,” the statement added.

Paris Saint Germain forward Kylian Mbappé has chosen Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo over Barcelona ace, Lionel Messi as his role model. Mbappé said he can no longer aspire to be like Messi but added that he can attempt to follow in the footsteps of Ronaldo. Messi and Ronaldo are widely known as the best two players in world football at the moment. Mbappé said that he cannot replicate Messi’s decision to remain at one club, but he can be inspired by Ronaldo’s journey around European football. “It’s already too late for me to have a career like Messi,” Mbappé told La Gazzetta dello Sport. “Otherwise I should have stayed at Monaco. “So, logically and without wanting to take anything away from Messi, I have to be inspired by Ronaldo’s career.”

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday stated that the world is waiting for justice in its case on Imo state guber election, at the Supreme Court. Uche Secondus, national chairman, spoke at an emergency meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the party in Abuja. He also disclosed that Senator Douye Diri, the Governor of Bayelsa, has commenced reconciliation moves in the state following the confirmation of his victory. Secondus said: “Great leaders of our party, between our last meeting a month ago and today a lot of water has passed under the bridge politically speaking. “The Supreme Court of Nigeria has through its ruling restored victory to the party in Bayelsa state resulting in the swearing in of Senator Douye Diri as Governor of Bayelsa state. NEC formally welcomes his Excellency to the meeting. “I should also report to you that Governor Diri has begun a genuine process of reconciliation in the state with a view to bringing the PDP in the state as one united family. “On the Imo state case which shook the nation to its marrow, the Supreme Court graciously accepted to review itself and this is still ongoing as the nation and indeed the international communities are anxiously waiting for justice. “The party leadership notes pressure from some victims of injustice at the court like Osun and Kano states but we are approaching every issue with absolute caution in relation to the weight of evidence.” The PDP chairman further informed NEC that the process for the conduct of party congress in 26 states is ongoing. He assured that the party leadership is ensuring “that we come out of it rancour free, stronger and more united in these states”.

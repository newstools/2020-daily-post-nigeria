Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has named Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Muller, Jerome Boateng, Manuel Neuer, and David Alaba as the five Bayern Munich players that must be respected following his side’s 3-0 defeat against the Bundesliga giants in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first leg encounter on Tuesday night. According to Lampard, Lewandowski, Muller, Boateng, Neuer, and Alaba must be respected because of their quality, adding that they have been in the Bayern Munich team for a long time. Two goals from Serge Gnabry and a strike from Robert Lewandowski ensured the Bavarians defeated Lampard’s men at Stamford Bridge. “There is a lot of quality in the Bayern Munich team,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying after the game. “Players like Lewandowski, Muller, Boateng, Neuer, and Alaba, have been in their team for a long time. “Bayern have much in their squad that we have to respect. “We suffered against them in the first half in moments, but we defended resiliently. “Technically, our defending was not great, but we stayed in the game and had a couple of chances.” Bayern Munich will now host Chelsea at the Allianz Arena in the last 16 second leg in March. Meanwhile, Chelsea and Bayern first met in the 2005 Champions League quarter-finals when current Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho, was in charge of the West London club. They defeated the German giants 6-5 on aggregate to qualify for the semi-finals. In recent times, Chelsea defeated Bayern Munich 4-3 on penalties to win the 2012 UEFA Champions League final after extra-time 1-1 draw, thanks to Didier Drogba’s penalty decider. But as it appears, things are not playing out as expected, from Chelsea’s point of view.

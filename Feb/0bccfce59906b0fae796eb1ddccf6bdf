Former Real Madrid and England striker, Michael Owen, has predicted that both Arsenal and Manchester United, will progress to the Europa last-16 stage on Thursday. The Gunners welcome Olympiacos to the Emirates, after winning 1-0 in Greece last week. United could only draw 1-1 with Club Brugge in Belgium. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men need to win by any margin, to assure themselves of a place in the next round. Owen, who has played for the Old Trafford outfit, told BetVictor about the Red Devils’ home fixture: “Anthony Martial has scored in his last three appearances for United and his equaliser in Bruges could be the vital goal in the tie. “This might not be the walk in the park that many would have us believe, but I expect Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side to make it safely through to the last 16.” Mikel Arteta’s men on the other hand, need to only defeat to progress. “The Greeks did win their last game at the Emirates back in 2015 but they lost 4-2 at Spurs in the Champions League earlier in the season, and I expect their return visit to north London to end in another defeat,” Owen added.

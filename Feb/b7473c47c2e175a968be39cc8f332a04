Kogi State Governor Alhaji Yahaya Bello has threatened to sanction any local government administrator who fails to remain in their respective Local Government Areas. DAILY POST learnt that the warning is coming as part of measures by the state government to tackle the security breaches at the grassroots. The commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Barr. Momodu Salami Ozigi disclosed this on Thursday when he met with administrators in the state. Our correspondent gathered that some Administrator in Kogi State have abandoned their Local Government for Lokoja the State capital and other States, instead of having direct links with their people to checkmate the state of insecurity in their area. According to the commissioner, “henceforth, Council Administrators must remain at their duty post to nip in the bud any uprising in their domain.” The commissioner said Governor Bello is security conscious and would not trade with it in his second term in office. He maintained that government had already put some measures in place to catch erring administrators for suspension. The commissioner noted that, Governor Bello has also directed the administrators to arrest any self acclaimed traditional ruler who intends to cause unrest in their community over chieftaincy tussle. “Some of the security breaches in Local Government Areas emanate from Chieftaincy tussles. A situation where unauthorized persons now parade themselves as traditional rulers has compounded security problems at the grassroots. Such persons must be handed over to the Directorate of State Security (DSS) for prosecution,” he stated.

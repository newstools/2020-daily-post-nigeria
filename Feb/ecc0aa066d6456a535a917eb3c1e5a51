Former Chelsea player, Tony Cascarino, has urged Manchester United to make a move for Juventus midfielder, Aaron Ramsey, in the summer transfer window. Cascarino believes the Welsh international would be a perfect fit for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. Ramsey has only played just twelve Serie A games for Maurizio Sarri’s side since joining the Bianconeri from Arsenal on a free transfer last summer. He also featured in Juventus’ 2-1 defeat against Verona in Serie A over the weekend.
Writing in his column for The Times, Cascarino said: “Ramsey would be the perfect fit for Manchester United. “I can see the former Arsenal midfielder back in the Premier League next season. “Reports linking him to Manchester United makes a lot of sense as he is the sort of player they need – a proven midfielder with goal scoring pedigree and plenty of Premier League experience. “I could see him not costing too much, with Juventus possibly settling for £20 million as that would get the Serie A champions most of their outlay back.”

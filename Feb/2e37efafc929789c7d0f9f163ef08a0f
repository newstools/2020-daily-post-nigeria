There was a mild drama at the Federal High Court in Abuja as the prosecution witnesses denied ever transferring money to Senator Shehu Sani who was being prosecuted for $25,000 bribery allegation. The proceeding came up on Tuesday before Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court 5, after the former lawmaker and human rights activist was detained for a month over a petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The petitioner, Alhaji Sani Dauda, proprietor of ASD Motors claimed that he gave Shehu Sani the sum of $25,000, a claim that Sani denied. However, after the presiding judge listened to the argument by the prosecution and defense counsels, he ordered for the witness testimony, but the witnesses who are staff of the Guarantee Trust Bank said: “We never transferred money to Senator Sani; we don’t know him in person.” They, however, confirmed that money was transferred from ASD Motors account to one, Mr. Shanono and Abubakar. The witnesses also testified that, “the ASD Motors proprietor, Sani Dauda transferred money in December, 2019.” The testimony was in response to the prosecution counsel’s question. The matter was adjourned to Wednesday, 25th February, 2020 for continuation.

Barcelona’s new striker, Martin Braithwaite, has joked he won’t wash his kit, after hugging Lionel Messi, during a 5-0 win against Eibar on Saturday. Braithwaite arrived from Leganes on Thursday for €18million. The Danish international was introduced for the final 20 minutes and laid on a cross for Messi’s fourth goal of the game. Braithwaite was also involved in the fifth goal, with goalkeeper Marko Dmitrovic pushing out his effort for Arthur Melo to score from the rebound. “Messi congratulated me [for the pass]. He’s a great guy. He tried to make me feel comfortable and looked to find me with his passes. “I won’t wash my kit after the hug he gave me [laughs]. Honestly, I am really happy to have been able to set him up for a goal,” he told reporters.

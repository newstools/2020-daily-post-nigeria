Suletankarkar Local Government in Jigawa State on Monday confirmed that fire has razed 10 houses, harbouring silos in Dirani village in the state. The council Information Officer, Alhaji Usman Abubakar, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday that the silos contained grains worth over N5 million. According to him, the fire which occurred late on Sunday, was believed to have started from a kitchen in one of the houses. “We are suspecting that the fence of the house caught fire from the cooking spot and spread to other houses in the neighbourhood,” he said. Also speaking on the development, the spokesman said the council’s Chairman, Alhaji Ja’afaru Mohammad, had visited the village for on-the-spot assessment of the incident. He therefore called on the State Emergency Management Agency to assist the affected persons with relief materials.

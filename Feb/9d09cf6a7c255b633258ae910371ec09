Zamfara State Governor, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle, has vowed that his administration must recover over N90bn from ex-governor Abdulaziz Yari, which was allegedly diverted through inflation of contracts. The governor made the vow during the presentation of interim report from the state’s projects verification committee, stressing that he would make sure that the diverted funds were returned to the state government treasury. “I must implement the committee’s report to ensure that all those involved in the scandal were brought to justice.” Speaking earlier, the chairman of the committee, Alhaji Ahmed Zabarma, told the governor that his committee had uncovered large sum of money diverted during the administration of Yari, urging him to set up a committee of enquiry to ensure the recovery of the looted money. The committee’s chairman explained that between 2011 and 2019, Yari’s administration awarded 6,180 contracts at various locations in the state “Many of such contracts were either poorly executed or not done at all, while the contract sums were also inflated,” he said.

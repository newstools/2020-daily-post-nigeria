Referee, Kenny Bayless has disclosed that he told American boxer, Deontay Wilder, he wanted to stop his fight against British fighter, Tyson Fury, before the towel was thrown in the ring. Fury had last weekend knocked out Wilder in the 7th round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, USA, to regain the WBC world heavyweight title. The 31-year-old dominated Wilder during the fight before Wilder’s co-trainer, Mark Breland, threw the towel in the ring in the seventh round. Reacting to the development, Bayless said Breland’s decision to stop the fight was good because he told Wilder in the minute’s rest between rounds to give him a reason not to end the fight. “I told Wilder in the minute’s rest between rounds before the stoppage to show me something so that I would not be able to stop the fight,” Bayless told SiriusXM. “It was a good stoppage because I wanted to stop the contest. “When I saw the towel in the ring from Wilder’s corner I stopped the fight. “Wilder is a warrior and his first word was why did I stop the fight before I told him that it was his corner that stopped it, but I was so close to stopping it.” Meanwhile, Deontay has since reacted to his defeat against Fury.

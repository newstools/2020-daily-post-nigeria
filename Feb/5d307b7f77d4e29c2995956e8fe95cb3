The two children of Doctor Philip Ataga who were abducted alongside their mother from their residence in Juji, Chikun Local Government Area of Kaduna metropolis almost two weeks ago have regained their freedom. DAILY POST reliably gathered from the community that they were reunited with their father at about 7 pm on Thursday night. On the ransom paid for their release, the source informed that eight million Naira was paid. It would be recalled that the kidnappers, two weeks ago, abducted Doctor Atagaâ€™s wife and two children. While the negotiation was on, the kidnappers called Dr. Ataga to take the dead body of his wife from a location in Kaduna while a ransom of #20million should be paid before the release of his two children, a boy and a girl. When called to confirm, the Kaduna State Police Command PPRO, DSP Yakubu Sabo was yet to pick his calls or respond to SMS sent to his line as at the time of filing this report

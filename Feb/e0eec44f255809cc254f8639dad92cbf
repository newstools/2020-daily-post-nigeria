The Zone RS2 Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has advised motorists against overloading, following the ban and restriction of the commercial motorcycle (Okada) and Tricycle (Keke) in Lagos. The zone RS2 Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) comprises Ogun and Lagos States. The Zonal Commanding Officer, Mr. Samuel Obayemi, gave this warning in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Monday. Obayemi said officers of the corps would not close their eyes and watch motorists overload their vehicles, especially commercial vehicles, for any reason. According to him, overloading remains an offence and commuters should not allow themselves be overloaded in a vehicle no matter the pressure. “Now that the state government has banned and restricted the use of Okada and tricycles in major highways in Lagos, a lot of motorists will now want to overload their vehicles, flouting the law against overloading. “We are saying that FRSC will not fold our hands and allow motorists to take laws into their hands. “FRSC will not tolerate overloading as a result of the ban on motorcycles and tricycles on Lagos highways. “It is an offence for you to overload your vehicle either with animals or people. Beginning from today, we will emphasize that people don’t overload their vehicles,” Obayemi said. Recall that the Lagos State Government had banned the operation of commercial motorcycles and tricycles in six local government areas and nine local council development areas in the state. A statement by the state’s Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho, said the government placed the ban to check the havoc done by motorcycles and tricycles in those communities. The embargo took effect on February 1st, 2020.

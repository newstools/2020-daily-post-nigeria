Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has hailed Raheem Sterling as a good player, but refused to speak about a possible move for the Manchester City forward. Sterling had described Los Blancos as “a fantastic club” and hinted he would be willing to join the Spanish giants. With City facing a two-year ban from European competitions, the England international’s future has become uncertain. Zidane admits he is an admirer of Sterling, but is unwilling to fuel speculations. “I can’t talk about a player who isn’t mine,” he told reporters on Friday. “He’s a very good player, no doubt about that.” Madrid face Levante in LaLiga on Saturday, before playing City in the Champions League next week.

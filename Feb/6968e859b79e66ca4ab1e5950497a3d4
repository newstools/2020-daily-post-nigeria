The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, has warned against any form of protest in the state. The governor said he will no longer tolerate and will deal with individuals and groups of persons sponsoring or inciting protests in Imo. The Governor said any more of such actions designed to destabilize his government activities and tamper with the peace of the state will be dealt with. He issued the threat against series of protests organised by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, following the removal of Emeka Ihedioha as the governor of the state by the Supreme Court. Governor Uzodinma spoke when the National Union of Road Transport Workers and Joint National Association of Persons with Disabilities (JONAPWD) held a solidarity rally for him at the government house in Owerri on Thursday. The former lawmaker said that he had tolerated enough the protest from some disgruntled elements in the state. According to Uzodinma, “My government will do all within the ambits of the law to maintain peace and order; those who are engaging in these incessant protests must stop forthwith. I took an oath to maintain peace and protect the lives and property of the citizens, I will not fail to deal with any group causing a breach of the peace in the state.”

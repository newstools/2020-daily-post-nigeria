Liverpool chief executive, Peter Moore, has admitted the club will not re-sign Phillipe Coutinho, because he no longer fits their style of play. Coutinho left for Barcelona in January 2018, after five years at Anfield for a fee which could rise to as much as £142million. The 27-year-old struggled to make an impact in his first 18 months at the Camp Nou and joined Bayern Munich on loan last summer. There has been speculation that Coutinho could return to Liverpool, but Moore suggests the team has evolved since his exit. “When Philippe Coutinho left there was a change, not only to the structure of the team but to the way we played football. “If you recall, when he left two years ago, then it was a complete change of style of play and we [hardly] lost a game over the balance of the season. “No disrespect to Philippe but he had a different style of play…The money came in and the money we got from Barcelona then helped fund Alisson Becker,” Moore said according to Soccer Laduma.

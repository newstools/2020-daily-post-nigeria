The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has declared Jan. 21 of every year to honour persecuted Christians in Nigeria. Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, Special Assistant Media and Communications media and communications to the CAN President, His Eminence, Rev. Samson Ayokunle disclosed this in a statement on Friday. The national day of prayers was declared in honour of the late slain CAN Chairman, Rev. Lawan Andimi who was killed by Boko Haram. “Jan. 21, was the day Rev. Andimi was killed by the Boko Haram terrorists after his refusal to convert to Islam as demanded by his captors, hence, it was a day chosen in his honour. “The resolution, according to the CAN President, became imperative in honour of all the Christians who have been killed by the Boko Haram terrorists, herdsmen killers, and the bandits nationwide. “We call on the Body of Christ in the country, especially denominational leaders to reflect the date in their annual calendar of activities. “The decision was taken Friday at the just concluded meeting of the National Executive Committee held at its National Secretariat in Abuja. “Joseph Daramola was also confirmed in the meeting as the substantive general secretary and Elder Biodun Sanyaolu as the Assistant General Secretary of CAN. “Daramola has been the acting general secretary of the association since the demise of the immediate past General Secretary, Rev Dr Musa Asake, after a brief illness,’’ he said.

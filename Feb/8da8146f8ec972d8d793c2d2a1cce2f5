Some members of the Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN) were on Tuesday attacked inside their Parks at 3 Venn Road North, Onitsha by hoodlums, who claimed to be revenue agents of the Anambra State Government. They were said to have attacked the tricycle group to enforce the order that purportedly banned TOAN. DAILY POST gathered that the aftermath of the savage attack that left the operators with life-threatening injuries, and battling for their lives. KeneChukwu Okeke, Chief Ombudsman, Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria (TOAN), who spoke to DAILY POST said they committed no offence other than improve the working conditions, as well as the economic and social status of tricycle workers. He said TOAN was put in place to increase productivity for the benefit of tricycle workmen, and the economy of the Federal Republic of Nigeria including Anambra State. Okeke also told DAILY POST that the Area Commander of the Onitsha Area Command Police Station , ACP John Obuagbaka, Area Commander Onitsha, had in reaction to the attack vowed to fish out the perpetrators of this heinous crime. He said Obuagbaka led over 50 Policemen in pursuit of the attackers who fled to the woods. When asked if the Anambra State Government was behind the attack on TOAN members, Obuagbaka said “Most definitely, because the Anambra State Government in banning the Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria had employed touts to chase out members of TOAN from the Parks and to collect revenue on behalf of the State Government.” Speaking on an earlier court order suspending the ban on TOAN, he said “the Anambra State Government has gone rogue, without regards to pending processes of Court in NICN/AWK/33/2019, intimidating, molesting, attacking and forcefully taking over tricycle parks managed by the Tricycle Owners Association of Nigeria in Anambra State. “The rule of law is being placed on its bald head.”

The Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has lifted the embargo imposed on the bank accounts of all the local governments of the state. This, it was learnt, takes effect from Monday, February 17. Gov Abiodun disclosed this during his first meeting with the newly appointed local government transition committee chairmen in Friday. A statement by the governor’s Senior Special Assistant on New Media, Emmanuel Ojo, disclosed this in a statement, saying: “The Governor of Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun has lifted the embargo placed on all the 20 local government bank accounts. This takes effect from 17th of February, 2020.” DAILY POST reports that Gov Dapo Abiodun, immediately after his inauguration on May 29, 2019, placed an embargo on the bank accounts of the 20 local governments and 37 local council development areas in the state. Abiodun, through a memo from the Local Government Service Commisision, directed that an embargo should be placed on all the bank accounts of all Local Governments and LCDAs with effect from May 30, adding that, “Equally, there should be no cash payments.” This was followed by the suspension of the elected Chairmen, Vice Chairmen, Councillors and their appointees by the eighth Ogun State House of Assembly, headed by former Speaker, Suraj Adekunbi. However, barely seven days to the end of their tenure, the Ogun ninth assembly lifted the suspension of the council chairmen, who are loyalists of former Governor Ibikunle Amosun.

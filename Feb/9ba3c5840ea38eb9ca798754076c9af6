The Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) has said Nigeria does not have money. BMO Chairman, Niyi Akinsiju, stated this on Sunday at the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum in Abuja. He stated that due to the situation, President Muhammadu Buhari was only implementing important policies that will positively affect the poor. Akinsiju said: “We have a President that is considerate that for every policy, the important thing to him would be the consequence to Nigerian poor and the Nigerian people.” He noted that the government was “thinking of building roads, upgrading schools, upgrading hospitals and all that when we have lesser money to attend to such”. “So, the reality is that Nigeria does not have money and I personally do not delude myself because we do not have money and the only way we can have money is a pure capitalist system that we are running. “We would have gone into taxing, removing subsidy and all that, that is what most capitalists of the other worlds are telling us to remove subsidy so that government would have more money.” Akinsiju pointed out that citizens, especially the poor will find it difficult to exist if such advice is taken. “There was just this 2.5 per cent increase in VAT and there was uproar, meanwhile our capitalist economists are telling us that we should have increased it to 15 per cent VAT, you can only imagine the outcome,” he said. He further blamed the nation’s underdevelopment on the previous administrations. The BMO chairman said bad roads, bad hospitals, bad schools were caused by those who governed Nigeria before Buhari. “If government of each particular period had been constructing 100 kilometers of road per year, you can only imagine how many roads would have been constructed”, Akinsiju added.

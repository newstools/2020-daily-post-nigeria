He ordered security agencies to fish out those responsible for the attack and ensure they face the full weight of the law. The Governor expressed anger over those heating up the state known for its peaceful atmosphere. The statement read: “We condemn in the strongest terms possible the alleged attack on the state chairman of the APC, Hon.

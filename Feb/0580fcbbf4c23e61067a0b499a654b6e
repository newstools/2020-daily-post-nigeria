Chelsea legend, John Terry has predicted the English Premier League, EPL, clubs that will finish in the top-four this season. Terry believes Chelsea will finish in fourth position on the Premier League table ahead of Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, while Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester City will finish ahead of Frank Lampard’s side. The Aston Villa assistant coach said this following Chelsea’s 2-0 defeat to Man United in the Premier on Monday night. “The race for the last spot on the top four for Chelsea will start this weekend against Tottenham,” Terry said as quoted by Metro UK. “It will be the perfect match to come and respond if you are a Chelsea supporter or player. “Tottenham are probably our biggest rivals, in terms of derby. “Stamford Bridge will be rocking and it will be a great opportunity for Chelsea players to prove themselves against Mourinho’s side and to first for the Blues shirt. “It will be an opportunity for some Chelsea players, probably there will be some little changes from after the defeat to Man United. “The game will be tough but I feel Tottenham and Man United have had some good results recently and I feel Chelsea are on the decline faintly. “However, I believe Chelsea will secure that fourth spot on the EPL table ahead of Tottenham and Man United, while Liverpool, Manchester City and Leicester City will take the top three spots.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he expects Odion Ighalo to make an instant impact, when he plays against Chelsea on Monday. Ighalo will join the rest of the United squad for the first time on Sunday. The Nigerian striker has spent the last two weeks in quarantine, having arrived from China where there is an outbreak of coronavirus. It means the 30-year-old will get just one session to integrate himself before the game, but Solskjaer doesn’t think it will be a problem. “As a striker you get thrown on and it might be he’ll have to come off the bench and give us a goal. “We needed another forward and when we got the chance to get Odion on a loan, that was for us a goalscorer. “He can help the club – very professional player, a good lad and will give something to the group.”

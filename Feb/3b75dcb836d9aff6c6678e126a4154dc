The Acting Rector of the Oke Ogun Polytechnic, Saki, Mr. Kayode Ogunmola has warned that there will be no room for indiscipline and indecent dressing in the institution . Ogunmola handed down the warning at the weekend while speaking at the institution’s 2019/2020 matriculation ceremony for its new students held at the institution’s ICT centre. The institution, according to him, “Cherishes disciplines and integrity, hence, indecent dressing such as wearing of armless cloths, top, gown, mini, micro skirts, coloured hair, bushy hairstyles, dreadlocks, long eyelashes, seductive trousers, crazy clothes, wearing of slippers and other ungodly act would not be condoned as enshrined in the Students’ Handbook of the institution”. The Acting Rector maintained that the Students Handbook of the Institution would be made available to the Students by the Students’ Affairs Office, adding that there is the need for the matriculants to face their career squarely and do away with such things that could tarnish the image or the institution and reputation or that of their parents and families. Ogunmola advised the matriculating students to desist from all forms of cult activities and as well respect all the rules and regulations of the institution. He added that, anyone caught violating the institution’s order would face the Students’ Disciplinary Committee. He maintained that, if found guilty, he or she may be suspended or face outright expulsion, depending on the gravity of the offense. The Rector also urged students not to shy away from partaking in sporting activities all work without play could make them dull students.

Chelsea goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga was ‘stunned’ by manager Frank Lampard’s decision to drop him, the UK Sun reports. He however expects to start on Monday, when the Blues host Manchester United in the Premier League. Lampard made the bold decision to axe Kepa for their trip to Leicester City before the winter break, with Willy Caballero starting in goal. Chelsea made Kepa the most expensive shot-stopper in history, when they paid Athletic Bilbao £72million for him in 2018. However, the Spaniard has struggled this season. Kepa is said to have held talks with Lampard this week and is eager to respond to his axing in the right way and rediscover his top form.

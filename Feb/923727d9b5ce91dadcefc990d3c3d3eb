The United States FAA says authorities are searching for a small jet that disappeared from the radar on Saturday. The Cessna Citation went missing about 50 miles north of Atlanta in the area of Gordon County and Cherokee County, Georgia. WSB-TV quoted FAA as saying that the aircraft departed from Atlanta Regional Airport-Falcon Field in Peachtree City, Ga., shortly before 10 a.m. “We do not know the number of people aboard or the destination yet. “We will release the aircraft registration after authorities locate the aircraft and confirm the conditions and identities of the people aboard,” the FAA said. The incident occurred less than two weeks after Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, died in a helicopter crash in California. All aboard were killed and the cause is under investigation.

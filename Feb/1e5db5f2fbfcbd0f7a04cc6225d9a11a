The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Enugu State Chapter, has debunked a report accusing the Enugu State Government of building an Islamic Centre at Uwani, Enugu, describing it as “false and misleading”. The social media has been awash in recent days of news that the Governor was building an Islamic Worship centre for the Muslims. But CAN has now come out to declare that no such project was taking place in any part of the State. In a statement by the State Secretary of CAN, Apostle Dr. Joseph Ajujungwa, the Christian body disclosed that the state government “recently approved to build a Chapel of Worship at the Government House, Enugu, not an Islamic Centre, as being mischievously peddled on social media”. Apostle Ajujungwa stated that, “CAN is happy with Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi for being the first governor of the state to construct a Centre of Christian worship inside the Government House, Enugu.” He stressed that, “the feat is a proof that he is a true and committed Christian who serves God faithfully.” The CAN State Secretary warned, “those behind this fake news to desist from such acts that could divide us, by spreading rumours that are false”.

Chelsea attacking midfielder, Willian, has said that Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, wanted him to leave Chelsea for Premier League giants, Manchester United. Willian said when Mourinho became the coach of Man United in 2016 after he left Chelsea in 2015, the Portuguese wanted to bring him to Old Trafford, but because of his love for the Blues, he decided to remain at the West London club. The 31-year-old said this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Tottenham on Saturday. Mourinho signed the Brazilian international for Chelsea from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013. Writing in his column for The Players’ Tribune, Willian said: “When Mourinho became the coach of Manchester United, he wanted me to leave Chelsea and move to Old Trafford. “The way he made the request to him was so respectful.” Willian added: “I have played for Chelsea for over six years now, and I can honestly say that I am very happy at the club. “If you ask my wife if she wants to leave London, she will say no.”

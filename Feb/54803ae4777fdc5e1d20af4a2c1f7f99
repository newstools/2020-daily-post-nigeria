Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has described ex-President of Kenya, Arap Moi, as one of the foremost leaders of African decolonisation. This was contained in a statement on Tuesday by his spokesman, Laolu Akande. Osinabjo spoke at the state funeral for the late Moi in Nairobi. Osinabjo said many people in Africa “will remember him in particular for the pioneering work that he did, especially with respect to regional cooperation. “He was, as we have heard, very instrumental in the resuscitation of the East African Community along with President Museveni and others. “He was also very instrumental in Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and even the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, IGAD. “These are the precursors of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement arrangements we are making today and to which almost every African country has subscribed. “And it will define the future of trade and relations in Africa”. Other leaders who paid tributes included Presidents Paul Kagame of Rwanda and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda. Moi, who was in power from 1978 to 2002, died on February 4 at the age of 95.

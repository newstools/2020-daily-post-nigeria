Liverpool boss, Jürgen Klopp, has named striker, Roberto Firmino as a unique player in his squad. Klopp said this while reacting to the Brazilian’s performance in Liverpool’s 4-0 win against Southampton over the weekend. Firmino gave three assists during the encounter against Southampton as goals from Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Jordan Henderson, and Mohamed Salah ensured the Reds defeated the visitors at Anfield. “Firmino is unique,” Liverpool’s official website quoted Klopp as saying.
“He’s just exceptional, a very football-smart person. “In the first half against Southampton, in between a tight formation, the way Firmino keeps and drops the ball, how he makes things happen is very special. “Even a player like Bobby Graham needs an address where he can send the ball because he cannot take the shot a shot turn to chase the ball alone. “How Firmino uses the skills of his teammates is special. I don’t know a player like him, and that is true.” The win over Southampton means Liverpool are now 22 points ahead of second-place Manchester City on the Premier League table.

The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has seized 147 sacks of pangolin scales weighing 9,504.1kg worth N10.26 billion. The Comptroller-General of Customs, Hameed Ali, at a media briefing in Lagos on Tuesday, said the Zone A unit made the seizure. Pangolin scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine to help with ailments ranging from lactation difficulties to arthritis. The scales are typically dried and ground up into powder, which may be turned into a pill. Ali noted that Nigeria, as a signatory to CITES (Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species), categorises the species under absolute prohibition. “It is my pleasure to brief you again on the recent gains of Nigeria Customs Service anti-smuggling operations,” NAN quoted him as saying. “On Jan. 19, the roving team of the NCS, Federal Operations Unit, while on credible intelligence, uncovered an abandoned warehouse at Isheri Estate, Lagos, where 2x20ft containers were stacked. “The containers were immediately evacuated to the premises of FOU Zone A, Ikeja, where physical examination revealed 147 sacks weighing 9,504.1kg of pangolin scales worth N10,264,428,000.00,” he said. Ali disclosed that the pangolin would be handed over to the National Environmental Standards and Regulations Enforcement Agency (NESREA).

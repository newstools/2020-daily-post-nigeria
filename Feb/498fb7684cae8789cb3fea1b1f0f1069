A 30-year-old man was on Sunday caught with what is suspected to be an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) at the Sabon Tasha branch of the Living Faith Church, (aka Winners) Chapel in Kaduna. This is Just as the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pa Enoch Adeboye led members on a prayer walk to decry insecurity in the country. DAILY POST gathered from a source at the church that this was not the first time the suspect was coming to the church, adding that just last week, he came but was sent away. A source who is also a member of the church, Brother Ekpenyong Edet, who said he is the Chief Security Officer of the parish confirmed to DAILY POST that the suspect was monitored on a CCTV Camera carrying the bag into the church auditorium. According to him, the suspect successfully gained access and was already seated before his bag was searched and the explosive device was found. Edet who said he was not in a position to hand out details to the press, appealed to our correspondent to wait to get details from the presiding pastor when the service was over. He, however, said the suspect had been handed over to the police and moved to the Sabon Tasha Division of the Nigeria Police Force. An officer at the Sabo Police station confirmed to DAILY POST that the suspect had actually been brought there when our reporter went to get more details but directed our reporter to speak with the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO). Efforts to reach the PPRO as at the time of filing this report proved abortive as he did not take his calls nor responded to a text message sent to his WhatsApp messenger.

A former lawmaker representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District at the upper legislative chamber of the National Assembly, Senator Shehu Sani, has said that the purported move by the Federal Government to recruit new soldiers to fight insurgency in the North East will not bring the desired solution. According to him, it would yield no positive result recruiting soldiers when those on the battle front are not being taken care of. The former lawmaker advised that government instead of recruiting more soldiers, should equip those already on war front and see to the welfare of the fallen heroes. Sani said that modern weapons and technologies should be deployed, arguing that this would boost the morale of soldiers to fight and defend their fatherland. Senator Sani tweeted, “Recruiting and deploying a new 100k soldiers to combat insurgents in the North East will not solve d problem. “Equipping the ones on the ground, improving their welfare package, taking care of the families of the fallen ones and the use of modern technologies in the battle is the way forward.”

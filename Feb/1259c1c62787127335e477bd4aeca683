The Middle Belt Forum, MBF, has observed that those involved in lamentations over Governor Darius Ishaku’s absence from the state are inspired by negative political partisanship. The forum noted that even with the absence of governor Ishaku, he has done everything to safeguard lives and property in the state, saying that any attempt to discredit him amounts to sheer wickedness. A statement from MBF National President, Dr. Pogu Bitrus, said, “Those engaged in lamentations over the Governor’s absence are obviously inspired by negative political partisanship aimed at creating ripples of discord and mischief in the state. As a Forum, we understand that those opposed to the Ishaku-led government would not rest on their oars to spread dreadful falsehood in a bid to cause discontent and discredit the tranquility and development enjoyed by the people. “To discredit Governor Ishaku who has done everything to safeguard lives and property in the state amounts to sheer wickedness. Therefore, the current attempt to spuriously discredit Ishaku by alleging that his absence could fuel insecurity in the state is not only malicious and unacceptable but also a demonstration of the weakling state of mind those opposed to Governor Ishaku are suffering from.” The forum observed that, “As the umbrella organisation representing ethnic nationalities in the Middle Belt Region, we wish to state that Governor Ishaku has been avowedly committed to the defence of lives and property as demonstrated by the state government’s act of embarking on development projects towards peace and harmony amongst the diverse ethnic groups in the state.

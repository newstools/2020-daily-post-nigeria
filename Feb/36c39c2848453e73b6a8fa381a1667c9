Steven Bergwijn only arrived from Tottenham Hotspur in a £27m deal, days before he was thrust into the starting line-up to face Manchester City on Sunday. Jose Mourinho, master of mind games, urged the media and fans not to put pressure on the Dutch winger “A player for the future. A young boy. Let’s not try to put him under pressure so that he has to arrive and perform, has to score, has to be man of the match; has to start the game. “But he is a player that sooner or later the fans are going to love.” Around 6pm UK time on Sunday, Spurs fans were already on their feet applauding Bergwijn. The 22-year-old was making his way off the pitch injured, after he opened scoring with a splendid control and finish, as the hosts turned the screw on 10-man City. Not even the knock could ruin his perfect debut. “Unbelievable. A dream for me that’s come true, and I’m so happy to be here. “As a little kid you want to play in the Premier League, and if you score on your debut it’s unbelievable,” Bergwijn said afterwards.

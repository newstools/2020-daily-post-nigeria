Osun State Police Command, on Tuesday, arrested two suspected ritualists, Adesina Adeniyi 42, and Oluwole Olapade, 58. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Johnson Kokumo, while parading the suspects before newsmen confirmed that two human skulls and a liver was found on Adeniyi, one of the suspects while travelling in a commercial bus to Ibadan, Oyo State. Kokumo told newsmen that the suspects took the skulls from a cemetery where he was serving as an attendant. ”Following the murder of one Favour Oladele-Daley, we decided to rid the state of a ritual element in the state and during one of such efforts, a suspected ritualist was caught with two human skull and other human parts. ”Upon investigation after the arrest of the suspect, his accomplice, Oluwole Olapade, a resident of Yemetu in Ibadan was trailed and arrested. Olapade, a native doctor, who required human skull for charm had pledged to pay N20,000 per skull to the attendants. ”He told us that he got the skull before which he claimed did not produce money, hence, he decided another skull should be procured for use”, the Commissioner of police added. Upon interrogation, the suspect said this was not his first time, adding that he looks for skull in open cemetery in the town and has gotten one for his customer before and was supposed to deliver another one to him before he was caught. He, however, added that he also operates a patent medicine store and was yet to be married.

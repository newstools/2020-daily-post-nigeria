Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has handed Odion Ighalo his first start for the club against Club Brugge in the Europa League last 32. Ighalo arrived on a six-month loan from Shanghai Shenhua in the January window. Since then, the former Super Eagles striker has made two substitute appearances for United against Chelsea and Club Brugge away. Ighalo has failed to find the back of the net in both games he has featured. United drew 1-1 against the Belgian club in the first leg and Ighalo will be looking to fire Solskjaerâ€™s men into the next round.

Premier League clubs have agreed to move the summer transfer deadline to the beginning of September. The window in England has closed 24 hours before the new season kicked off for the last two seasons. However, clubs feel they will benefit from a longer window, to sort out transfer business. With August 31 being a Bank Holiday, the window will close 5pm on Tuesday, September 1 this year. This ensures England is now in sync with the rest of Europe. “At a shareholders’ meeting today, Premier League clubs voted to adopt a change to the summer transfer window closing date for season 2020/21. “This will move the closing date back to the traditional point at the end of August/early September. “The 2020 closing date will therefore be 17:00 BST on 1 September (31 August 2020 being a UK Bank Holiday). “Clubs agreed after discussing the topic at length at previous Shareholders’ Meetings,” a Premier League statement read. The Premier League also confirmed the 2020/2021 season will start on Saturday, August 8.

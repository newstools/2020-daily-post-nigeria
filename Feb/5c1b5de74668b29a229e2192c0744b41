The Founder of the Evangelical Church of Yahweh Worldwide, Primate Theophilus Olabayo, has revealed what he claimed to have heard from God concerning the governorship election in Edo State and the 2023 presidential election. Prophet Olabayo, whose number of prophesies had reportedly come to pass in recent times, said that the North will retain power beyond 2023. The prophet, who notably predicted the death of Sani Abacha, Nigeria’s former Head of State and MKO Abiola, said a new political party will emerge and fizzle out the All Progressives Congress, APC, and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, before the general elections. Olabayo told The Sun that there will be series of political assassinations in Edo State, and warned the National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole to calm down. “Power will remain in the North in 2023. We should not be fooling ourselves. All the money that politicians in the South West are spending in anticipation of winning the 2023 presidency will not go anywhere,” he said. “Let them sit down and work for their people. The roads are bad and there is no infrastructure anywhere.” Ahead of the election in Edo, he said, “Oshiomhole should calm down; all these braggadocio will not take him anywhere. What I am seeing is that political assassination will be so rampant in Edo State and people should watch.” Speaking further on 2023, he added, “A new party will emerge; APC and PDP will fizzle out before 2023 because a new dawn is coming. “God will raise people whose names have not been heard before in this country and they will raise the banner of this country. Truth will come out.”

Former Nigeria winger, Garba Lawal, has warned Odion Ighalo about the size of challenge that lies ahead of him at Manchester United. Ighalo will spend the rest of the season at United, after agreeing a six-month loan deal with the Red Devils. The 30-year-old previously played for Watford in the Premier League. During his spell at Vicarage Road, he scored 33 goals in 82 appearances. However, Lawal says United is on another level entirely, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men competing in the Europa League knockout stages and aiming to finish in the top four. “I want to say congratulation to him and there will be more challenges for him now week-in week-out because Manchester United is not Watford. “The expectation from Manchester United will be much higher than Watford. It will be massive. It’s not going to be easy. “He has to prepare very well. The club will be expecting 100% from him which I believe he is capable of doing,” Lawal told Goal.

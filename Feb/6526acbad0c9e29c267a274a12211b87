Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has disclosed why he started new midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, in his side’s Premier League clash against Wolves on Saturday night. Solskjaer said he decided to start Fernandes, who only joined the club on Wednesday from Sporting Lisbon because the Red Devils needed ‘fresh legs’. He also stated that Man United fans wanted to see the Portuguese play for the Old Trafford club as soon as possible. DAILY POST had reported that Fernandes signed a four-and-a-half-year contract with United. When asked why he decided to start Fernandes, Solskjaer told Sky Sports before the kick-off: “Well, I think there is been loads of fans waiting for Bruno to come and the players as well. “He’s been a very good influence since he is come. Of course, it is been a few hectic days for him, but I think just the boost of Fernandes being around has been good for everyone. “He’s raring to go, he wants to play, and for us, we need some fresh legs as well. We have had 18 games in the last two months, and it’s quite a big demand for these boys.”

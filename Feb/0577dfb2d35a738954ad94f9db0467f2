Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has included Odion Ighalo in his 18-man matchday squad, for their trip to Chelsea on Monday night. The 30-year-old finally joined the rest of the team for training on Sunday, after his 14-day incubation elapsed. Ighalo did not travel with Solkjaer and the squad for their winter break in Marbella, Spain last week over coronavirus fears. However, he kept himself fit with a personal trainer in Manchester. It is not certain if Solskjaer will hand the Nigerian his debut from the start at Stamford Bridge. According to TalkSport, Ighalo might be given a chance, as “the Red Devils have nothing to lose by sticking their new signing up front”. Kick off is 9pm West African time.

The Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, on Friday, disclosed that the Federal government of Nigeria is working towards making management and control of land borders ICT-driven for effective surveillance and intelligence gathering. He added that the government would be partnering with Global Information and Communications Technology company, Huawei, to achieve this goal. According to him, the enviable performance and laudable antecedent of the ICT company had proven its capacity to handle projects of that magnitude. Aregbesola made this known while commissioning some projects donated by the company to Ogedengbe School of Science, Ilesa, Osun State, which include toilet, water supply and laboratory to create conducive environment for learning in the school. The Managing Director of the company, Mr Zhang Lulu, while handing over the projects said that the firm was committed to achieving a fully digitalised system in Nigeria, adding that Nigerian youths must be well equipped with ICT skills to contribute immensely to the nation’s growth and development. He maintained that Nigeria is blessed with many talented minds who possess requisite ideas and innovation to turn around the fortunes of the country if such talents are properly annexed. Lulu explained that his company recognises Corporate Social Responsibility as essential duty of every organisation as a way of supporting their immediate environment, saying the company has been doing that for over two decades in Nigeria. “As a leading global ICT solutions provider, Huawei has been a great factor in developing Nigeria through ICT. “Apart from increased connectivity, Huawei has also been committed to building skills at all levels of the society, by providing technology in schools,” he said.

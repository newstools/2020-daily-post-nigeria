Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has insisted that the club’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, is not deliberately avoiding matches. Woodward’s house was attacked by fans on Tuesday, but the American went ahead to seal two late transfers before January’s deadline. Bruno Fernandes arrived in a deal that could reach £67.7million, while Odion Ighalo agreed to a six-month loan move. Supporters threatened to walk out in the 68th minute of Saturday’s clash with Wolves, in protest at the Glazer family’s running of the club. That walk-out never materialised, though, with Woodward’s empty seat attracting more attention. When asked if Woodward’s no-show was to avoid becoming a distraction, Solskjaer told the media: “Well, no, I don’t think so. He had other commitments so that’s alright. “I must say, there’s been loads written, loads of talk, about the fans and our fans before the game and they were unbelievable again. “They supported the team until the end, started off really well creating this atmosphere, and they’ve just shown again that they’re the best ones in the world.”

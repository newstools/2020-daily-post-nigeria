Pep Guardiola has expressed delight over Manchester City’s 2-1 Champions League first-leg victory over Real Madrid at the Bernabeu on Wednesday. However, Guardiola warned that Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane will be scrutinising his [Guardiola] tactics ahead of the second leg, adding that the LaLiga giants have a history for comebacks. The Spaniard delivered a surprise last night, with both his choice of players for the game and tactics. He decided to have Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero on the bench and switched Gabriel Jesus to the left flank while Kevin De Bruyne played as a false nine. His tactics paid off with Jesus and De Bruyne scoring for City to make Isco’s opener insignificant. “I’m happy for the victory of course but for the performance as well,” Guardiola told reporters after the game. “We tried to play against this team in quite good personality. They started really well and for the first 10-15 minutes we could not take the ball. “We were not able to make the sequences of 10-15 passes in a row. After 15 minutes, we played really good. “When we were playing better we concede a goal which we should not concede at this level but sometimes we do these kind of things. “When Madrid were playing better we scored a goal and after that found our rhythm and we scored a second one.” Guardiola said though he is happy with the win, the game is not over because “If there’s one team in the world that can overcome everything, it is this club for its experience, its history.” He, however, assured that hopefully, Man City will perform better in the second leg and progress to the quarterfinals. He added, “I’m pretty sure Zidane and his people are going to look at what we have done and the second game will be different, we’ll have to be cautious and be alert to what he’s trying to do, adapt quick and try to go there to win the game.”

The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has urged security agencies to arrest the suspended Chairman of the Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property (SPIP), Okoi Obono-Obla. Obono-Obla, former Special Assistant on Prosecution to President Muhammadu Buhari, is on the ICPC wanted list for alleged corruption and abuse of office. Last November, he accused Vice President Yemi Osinbajo of being behind his ordeal. ICPC spokesperson, Rasheedat Okoduwa, told newsmen in Abuja that the former presidential aide had resorted to propaganda against the commission instead of turning himself in. Okoduwa said the commission was aware that the former presidential aide was back in the country, and was even sighted at an event recently. The official said they were aware that Obono-Obla has returned to the county and everything he has been saying about the commission and its chairman. “He is reportedly going about saying ICPC is a rival office to his own. I have people calling me to react on what he has said. “The decent thing is for the gentleman to come to ICPC to clear his name. We have given him an opportunity to clear his name of the allegations against him. “Come forward, let us hear your own side of the story. We have done our investigations and have facts. We want to confront him with these facts,” she said. Okoduwa further disclosed that signals have been sent to all law enforcement agencies to “pick up” Obono-Obla wherever he is sighted.

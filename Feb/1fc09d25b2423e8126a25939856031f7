Odion Ighalo has said watching Manchester United struggle after Sir Alex Ferguson retired, made him “angry”. The former Super Eagles striker is a boyhood United fan and signed for the Red Devils in January on a six-month loan. Ighalo is now determined to help put things right as part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad. “So it is difficult sometimes as when the team is losing games, as a fan you get angry. Now I’m in the club I have to give my best to make sure we try to win and get results. “It is going to be more difficult, but I think this team, we have young players and working this way, I think we have a better future,” Ighalo said according to ESPN. Ighalo marked his first United start in the 5-0 win over Club Brugge with his first goal.

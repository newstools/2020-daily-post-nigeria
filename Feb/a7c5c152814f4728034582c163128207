The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on the Inspector General of Police, Adamu Mohammed, to immediately arrest the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole. The party made the call in a statement on Friday by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan. PDP said Oshiomhole should be questioned over the violence and arson being perpetuated allegedly by APC agents in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital. The party accused the former Edo State governor of inciting the people against the Governor-elect, Duoye Diri. “Oshiomole’s statement was a direct call for sedition and violent subversion of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the statutory authority of the Supreme Court and the mandate of the people of Bayelsa state”, PDP said. “He should therefore be pulled in immediately for prosecution for inciting violence and arson in the state. “Nigerians can recall that our party had on Thursday cautioned Oshiomhole over his utterances and apparent plots to cause violence and a breakdown of law and order in the state. “The world watched with horror as APC agents, chanting APC slogans, assaulted the people of Bayelsa state, set the PDP secretariat in the state ablaze, attacked the premises of Radio Bayelsa, vandalized vehicles and equipment, took over major highways and attacked travellers, all in the bid to violently subvert the judgment of the Supreme court and forcefully take control of the state.” The PDP charged the people of Bayelsa, the security agencies and Nigerians at large, to hold Oshiomhole responsible and accountable for the violence in Bayelsa state and deal with him accordingly in line with the provisions of the law. It added that Oshiomhole must be brought to book and stopped from the use of garrulity and clear misuse of language to cause crisis in Nigeria

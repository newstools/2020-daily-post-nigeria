Justice S.C Amadi of the Rivers State High Court, Port Harcourt, has convicted and sentenced Hussaini Abubakar, a former staff of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to one year imprisonment with N150,000 option of fine. He was charged to court for stealing, contrary to Section 383 (1) and punishable under Section 390 of the Criminal Code CAP 37 vol. II Laws of Rives State of Nigeria, 1999. The defendant was arraigned by the EFCC, Port Harcourt Zonal Office on a three-count charge, bordering on stealing. Count one of the charge reads: “That you, Hussaina Abubakar, in 2017 at Port Harcourt in the Port Harcourt Judicial Division did fraudulently steal an exhibit from the Forensic Section of EFCC, an exhibit which you knew was recovered in the course of investigation to wit: One Lenevo S60-A (daul sim) with serial number: HBOGOHAQ with IME slot number: 1-866059026043140, worth N18,000, belonging to one Chuku Nelson Nyegam and thereby committed an offence.” The defendant pleaded guilty to all the charges, prompting prosecuting counsel, N. A. Dodo to urge the court to convict and sentence him accordingly. However, defence counsel, M. M Suleiman prayed the court to temper justice with mercy. Suleiman premised his prayer on the grounds that Abubakar is a first time offender who has no previous conviction record, an orphan, a married man, a father of a 15-months-old baby and a bread winner for his family.

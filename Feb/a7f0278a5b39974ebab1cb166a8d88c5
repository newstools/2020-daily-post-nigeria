The Sultan of Sokoto, Saad Abubakar, has expressed concern over the increase in the number of orphans in the North. According to him, they “would turn out to be worse than Boko Haram”, if the situation is not tackled. Abubakar stated this while speaking at the Northern Security meeting convened by Arewa Research and Development Project (ARDP) meeting in Kaduna on Thursday. The Sultan claimed that the number of orphans in the region stands at over 50,000 and called on state governors to do more with regards to insecurity. “Governors must see that they do more to address the insecurity. Just imagine that there are over 50,000 orphans who don’t know their parents. “They will be worse than Boko Haram if allowed to grow without proper care. “Several recommendations have been made but are not implemented, and as it remains unimplemented, we will continue to suffer the consequences, the Sultan said.

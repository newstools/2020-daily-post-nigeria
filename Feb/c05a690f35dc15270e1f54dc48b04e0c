Rangers manager, Steven Gerrard, says he is “really interested” to see if the Premier League will take action against Manchester City, which could see them stripped of the title they won in 2014. City have been handed a two-year suspension from European competitions by UEFA, for breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules. However, the champions will appeal the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). Pep Guardiola’s men could also lose a title, if a separate Premier League investigation deducts points retrospectively. Gerrard was Liverpool’s captain, when City won the title in 2014, with only two points. “We will see whether the Premier League acts from there. But if you look at the severity of the punishment from UEFA, something has gone badly wrong. “So I’m really interested to see the outcome of that. Until I get the punishment from the Premier League, I won’t comment further. But I’m really, really interested in it…for obvious reasons,” Gerrard told reporters on Sunday.

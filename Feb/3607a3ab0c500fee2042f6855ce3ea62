Hon. David Idris Zakarias representing Idah/Ibaji/Igalamela/Odolu/Ofu Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, says he will sponsor a peace and reconciliation dialogue between Oforachi Community in Igalamela/Odolu local government and Fulani settlers to ensure a peaceful coexistence as was the case in years back. Reacting in an exclusive interview with DAILY POST in Abuja, the lawmaker was saddened by the resurgence of herders and farmers clashes, stressing that life has offered opportunity for all to live peacefully, if there was understanding among all. He decried the killing of a farmer, late Godwin Egbunu at Oforachi in the presence of two Police officers who accompanied him to the farm after he complained that his crops were destroyed by herders’ cows. The lawmaker recalled that some Fulani have lived among the Igala people in Kogi East Senatorial District for centuries who now understand the culture and even speak the language, wondering what went wrong that there was crisis all over the place. “I am aware of the tension as a result of the killing of a 65 year old Godwin Egbunu by some Fulani herders which sparked reprisal from the youths. It is worrisome because it has to do with retaliation. “I have visited the community which is directly my constituency to calm frayed nerves, but I will sponsor dialogue for us to have long lasting peaceful coexistence. “The security agents have intervened after we made a complaint and it is important to know that Fulani herders have been living in Igala land for centuries now and we must all live together. Recall that youths from Oforachi community reportedly killed four herders in reprisal attack for the killing of one Mr. Godwin Egbunu last week, a situation that has left the people of Oforachi community living in fear of herders invasion again.

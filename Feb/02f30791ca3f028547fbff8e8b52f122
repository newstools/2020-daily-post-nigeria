Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has admitted he is not sure if Eden Hazard will play for the club again this season. Hazard limped off in the second half of Madrid’s 1-0 defeat to Levante on Saturday. Scans have since confirmed the Belgian suffered a hairline fracture to his right ankle. Hazard only just returned from a three-month layoff and played only two matches before picking up another injury. “I can’t tell you. It is hard to say.We don’t know if he will be operated on, but he’s obviously not happy. He had been out for almost three months and then played two games and picked up an injury. “Obviously it is very bad news for him, but I can’t tell you if he’s going to be back before the season is over,” Zidane told a press conference, ahead of the Champions League last-16 first leg against Manchester City. Hazard only moved to Real Madrid last summer from Chelsea. The 29-year-old has netted one goal for Los Blancos in all competitions.

The Supreme Council of Sharia in Nigeria said social vices are the main causes of insecurity in Nigeria. National Vice president, Shiekh Abdulrashid Hadiyatullah, disclosed this at a courtesy visit to Jigawa State Governor, Alhaji Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, in Dutse. He said Nigeria had been going through series of criminal activities and several efforts were put in place to curtail the problems, but all to no avail. He explained that people have engaged themselves in different social vices including; rampant cases of adultery, rape against minors, homosexual, corruption, abuse of trust, abuse of public office, among others. Abdulrashid said repentance and total submission to the will of Allah remain the only solution to the insecurity situations in the country. ” In any society where such vices became order of the day, what will certainly follow is social and economic crises as it is happening now in Nigeria. ” The increase of insecurity, kidnapping, insurgency, armed robbery, homicide, poverty and other social crises are repercussion of moral decadence of the society and can only be cured through spiritual societal reorientation ” They urged Governments and other political and community and religious leaders to addressing the problems. Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar said, his government has been working hands in hands with religious leaders to promote norms and values and also discourage all forms of social vices in the state. He promised to continue collaborating with religious bodies, security agencies to tackle the existing problems.

Boxing legend, Floyd Mayweather Jnr, has broken his silence on American boxer, Deontay Wilder’s defeat to British fighter, Tyson Fury. DAILY POST had reported over the weekend that Fury knocked out Wilder in the 7th round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, USA, in their rematch on Saturday night to regain the WBC world heavyweight title. Mayweather, a fellow countryman with Wilder, said the 34-year-old is still a champion despite losing to Fury in Las Vegas. Reacting to the development, Mayweather, in a post on his official Instagram page, wrote: “Win, Lose or Draw, Deontay is our brother that has accomplished many triumphs. “As a community, we should all uplift and support him throughout it all. No matter what, you’re still a winner in my eyes, King!” Deontay has since reacted to his defeat against Fury.

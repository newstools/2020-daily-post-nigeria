A district Head of Gayari town in Gummi Local Government Area of Zamfara State, Alhaji Hassan Mohammed kidnapped by notorious kidnappers in the district has regained his freedom. The kidnappers, however, did not release his son , Yasir Mohammed , who was also kidnapped along with his father last Saturday . One of the members of Mohammed ’s family, Farouq Gayari , told newsmen in Gusau, the state capital that the kidnappers were paid a ransom of N5 million as against the N40m they had earlier demanded for the release of the father and son. Gayari said , “When the N5 million was given to them , they only released the district Head, Hassan Mohammed, and refused to release his son, Yasir Hassan,” he said. He said that the kidnappers demanded two motorcycles before they could release the son of the district head. According to Gayari, the family members were making efforts to procure two motorcycles to give to the kidnappers so as to release Yasir. However, the state Police Command said it was putting in more efforts to arrest the abductors of the district head and his son for possible prosecution. “We must ensure the apprehension of the notorious kidnappers so that they could reveal their sponsors,” the state police command said.

The Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari has expressed concern over the state of power generation in Nigeria. Kyari who lamented over the decline of the power sector said electricity is now “a luxury” and exclusive for the elite. The NNPC boss said this at the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit in Abuja on Tuesday. “For Nigeria and many of us in sub-Saharan Africa, what we worry about today is actually the meals of today. There are many who can’t afford a meal a day. Electricity is largely a luxury; it’s only for the elite, like all of us here. “It is the dream of many to have I-pass-my-neighbour in their homes. When you say, ‘do not use fossil fuel,’ but you have not provided alternatives. “The world has not looked at their situation and recognised that there is abject poverty in the communities. According to Kyari, power is needed in Nigeria to create jobs so as to have peace in the country. Kyari added, “We have to solve the issue of electricity so that we can talk about renewable energy in the future and reduce the use of fossil fuel that has a high impact on the environment. “There is an energy transition in the world. With time, there will be less dependence on fossil fuel. “We need power to create jobs and we must create prosperity so that we can have peace in our country.” he said

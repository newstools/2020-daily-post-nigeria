The Federal High Court in Yenagoa has issued a warrant for arrest of four staff of United Bank for Africa PLC (UBA). The UBA and four staff members are standing trial on a four-count charge of conspiracy, fraud, cyber crime and stealing of N33.69 million. Justice Abimbola Awogboro made the order on Thursday following failure of the suspects to appear in court to respond to charges in a suit: FHC/YNG/10c/2019. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that UBA and four other suspects allegedly manipulated the account of the Federal High Court in Yenegoa by reversing a deposit ordered by the court without authorisation. The judge gave the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to arrest and present the suspects in court on March 30. N.A. Timothy-Hart, the Prosecuting Counsel, from the Department of Public Prosecution (DPP), Federal Ministry of Justice filed the motion for the arrest. The suspects allegedly caused the fraudulent reversal of N33.69 million already credited to the bank account of the Registrar of the Federal High Court, Yenagoa. This was after court ordered Nigerian Agip Oil Company to pay N33.69 million being compensation for an oil spill incident. However, the bankers to the oil firm, UBA, allegedly reversed the payment shortly after compliance. The charged added that the suspects claimed to have relied on a non-existing Court of Appeal order to effect such reversal.

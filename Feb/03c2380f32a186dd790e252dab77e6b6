The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in Edo State, Peter Esele, says recent happenings in the party, including the Supreme Court judgement on Bayelsa State, are reminders that it is time for the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, to go. Esele told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Benin on Sunday that Oshiomhole cannot claim ignorance that the Deputy Governorship Candidate of the party in Bayelsa was ineligible to contest the election. “In life, there comes a time when you must make a clear distinction between individual and institutional interests”, the APC governorship aspirant in 2016 said. The stalwart noted that Oshiomhole’s utterances about national issues had become a huge embarrassment to APC and Nigeria. Esele said that as the ruling party must defend the institutions no matter the pain or interest, adding that “Failure to do so is a recipe for anarchy”. He alleged that “The incompetence and corrupt practices at the national secretariat has resulted in the weakening of various important internal processes for the selection of party candidates.” “States like Bayelsa and Zamfara now have to contend with governors the people never voted for,” he said. Esele insisted that APC has been factionalised in Edo with the alleged support of Oshiomhole. “Neither faction will be able to fulfil the required provision of our party’s processes and protocol. “APC has outgrown the kind of theatrics displayed by Oshiomole who, ironically, was also a product of court processes. The time is now to thank him for his services to the party and move on. “Or, are we going to wail again, when the courts intervene to sack our candidate in Edo? There comes a time when you must choose sides. “This is one of such critical moments, and I dare say that Oshiomhole has tried and it is time for him to go,” Esele added.

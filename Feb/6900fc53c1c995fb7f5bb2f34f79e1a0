Chelsea midfielder, Matteo Kovacic, has compared manager, Frank Lampard and Juventus coach, Maurizio Sarri. He also compared Lampard and Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane. Kovacic, who joined Chelsea under Sarri from Real Madrid, says training under Lampard is always challenging, while under the Italian was dull. “I joined Chelsea under Maurizio Sarri, but honestly Lampard is an outstanding coach,” Kovacic told FourFourTwo. “Lampard has kept the character he had as a player in his personality as a manager, which has inspired all of us at Chelsea. “He commits himself with everything he has. Training here is always challenging and different from last season under Sarri. “That is perhaps the main difference between Lampard and Sarri, who made the concept of training at Chelsea quite monotonous.” He added: “Zidane’s coaching style is similar to that of Lampard and their methods really suit me.” Kovacic will hope to lead Chelsea to victory when they take on Manchester United in their next Premier League fixture after the international break.

The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Lagos Seaport Command, has arrested five stowaway aboard a vessel enroute Las Palmas, Spain. NIS spokesman, Sunday James, said this in a statement on Saturday. He disclosed that the report was made by the master of the vessel about 156 nautical miles off Lagos shoreline. The Comptroller of the Command, Olubushola Fashakin, who received the arrested stowaway, cautioned desperate youths from “embarking on “risky adventures”. Comptroller General, Muhammad Babandede, hailed the officers and the Comptroller for the arrest job. He called for a halt to “unwarranted travels by all means”. Meanwhile, the Immigration Service says the new Nigerian Visa Policy (NVP), aimed at expanding visa classes from 6 to 79, is in prospect and awaiting President Muhammadu Buhari’s approval. NIS explained that the current type of Visa classes, which are Transit, Tourist, Business, Subject to Regularisation (STR), Temporary Work Permit (TWP) and Diplomatic, was limiting.

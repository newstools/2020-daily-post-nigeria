Odion Ighalo has revealed that his mother broke down in tears, after he told her about his move to Manchester United. The 30-year-old has agreed a six-month loan deal with the Old Trafford side. The deal was confirmed few minutes before the January transfer deadline. In an interview with Manchester United Official website, Ighalo said his mum was overcome with emotions when it became official. “I was excited. I called my mum and she was happy, crying and all that. “This is your dream and all that and I’m happy for you. It was dramatic, I didn’t sleep through, I was very happy that finally, we got the deal done. “Yeah, it was very dramatic. My agent called me the day before and said Man United,” he said. Ighalo, who has been brought in as replacement for the injured Marcus Rashford, is in line to make his debut away to Chelsea after the winter break.

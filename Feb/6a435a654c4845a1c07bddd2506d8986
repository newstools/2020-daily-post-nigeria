Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, will be without Mesut Ozil and Lucas Torreira, for their Europa League last-32 clash at Olympiacos on Thursday, the Daily Mail reports. Ozil will not travel for the game, as his wife is due to give birth to their first child, while Torreira is ill. Arteta has recalled Matteo Guendouzi, who was dropped for their 4-0 victory over Newcastle last Sunday. January signing Pablo Mari is also available for selection, after a run-out on Monday with the Under-23s against Chelsea. Kieran Tierney (shoulder) and Cedric Soares (knee) are not yet deemed ready to join first-team training.

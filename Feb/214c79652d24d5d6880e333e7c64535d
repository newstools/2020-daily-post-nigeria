Former Arsenal player, Paul Merson, has predicted where Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur will finish in the Premier League table under their managers, Frank Lampard and Jose Mourinho this season. Chelsea are presently in fourth position on the Premier League table with 41 points from 25 games, while Tottenham are sixth in position with 37 points from the same number of games. Chelsea and Tottenham will face each other in a crunch top-four clash on February 22 at Stamford Bridge. “Chelsea are in pole position to finish in fourth position in the Premier League this season,” Merson said as quoted by The UK Sun. “Tottenham Hotspur cannot finish in the top four because I do not see them displacing Chelsea from that position at the moment. “Spurs are so fortunate right now because they have been torn to scraps in their last two games but still be able to get the victory.”

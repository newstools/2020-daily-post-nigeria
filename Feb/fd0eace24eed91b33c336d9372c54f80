Chelsea will be without Christian Pulisic, Callum Hudson-Odoi and N’Golo Kante for their Champions League round of 16 first leg clash against Bayern Munich on Tuesday, ESPN reports. The three players were also missing, when the Blues beat Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 in the Premier League on Saturday. Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said that he understands if his side are labelled as “underdogs” ahead of the game. Bayern won all six of their Champions League group games this season. This will also be the first time both teams face each other, since the 2012 Champions League final in Munich, which saw Chelsea beat Bayern on penalties. “I understand if people do call us the underdog because they [Bayern] are so strong. Being the underdog, it’s there for us to turn it around. “I think the underdog talk is better to come from outside, from people looking from out to in. When you look at their team — the talent they are already have, the medals they already have — maybe we don’t have that experience. “Being the underdog, if so, then it’s for us to turn it around. Those are the best stories in sport,” Lampard told reporters.

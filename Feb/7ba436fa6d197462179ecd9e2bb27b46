Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has praised Bayern Munich midfielder, Serge Gnabry, following the 24-year-old’s impressive display in the Bavarians’ UEFA Champions League round of 16 first-leg 3-0 win over Chelsea on Tuesday night. Bayern Munich defeated Frank Lampard’s men at Stamford Bridge, thanks to two goals from Serge Gnabry and a strike from Robert Lewandowski. Wenger, who coached Gnabry during their time at Arsenal before he loaned the Germany international to West Brom, told beIN Sports after the match: “Serge Gnabry has no real limitations,” Wenger told beIN Sports. “He has pace, power, technical ability, and he is brilliant. “I loaned him to West Brom, and it did not work out at all. In fairness, I think we had an agreement with him, and Bayern stole him away from Bremen. “He is a good player. He has the individual ability and collective ability.” Gnabry has become one of Bayern Munich’s most influential players since he joined the Bundesliga champions from Werder Bremen in 2018.

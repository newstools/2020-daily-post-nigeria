Former Manchester United coach, Rene Meulensteen, has compared Jesse Lingard to Barcelona legend, Andres Iniesta. Speaking on The Michael Anthony Show, Meulensteen said Lingard has similar qualities with Iniesta. The 27-year-old has struggled this campaing and has not scored in the Premier League since December 2018. Meulensteen said: “That’s the luck that you need and certain managers can see it. “Jesse always had attributes in his game as Iniesta had for Barcelona.” Meulensteen, who worked with United, between 2007 and 2013, also backed Lingard to find his best form again. He added: “Jesse, in my opinion – and I think he knows it himself, he’s a great kid – he’s the sort of player that’s so difficult for opposition teams to mark. “I think it’s more a confidence thing, you need to recognise as staff and coaches and say “OK, when did you have the best games? When did you score the most goals? And why isn’t it happening now?” “Somewhere down that line there’s a dent and you need to find that and what you can do to make sure the focus goes back.” Lingard is currently with United in Dubai on a winter break. The Englishman will be looking to impress manager, Ole Gunnar Solksjaer in the last three months of this season, especially with the arrival of Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon.

According to him, “we had about 70 convictions in Akwa Ibom State last year we have recovered a lot of money and we are progressing. We have arrested 200 persons so far. “This is an enlightenment campaign to sensitise and create awareness to people in the street about corruption. “Corruption should not be left to anti-corrupt agencies alone it is a difficult task which means that everyone should be incorporated in fighting corruption. “You youths are the backbone of this country, the future leaders and the pride of every society is to try and bequeath a decent society. “Look at what is happening in Northeast, what is the source of their money? It comes through some unscrupulous elements who steal our money, so, do not allow your future to be stolen away from you.” Also speaking, the Akwa Ibom State Coordinator of NYSC, Mr Julius Amusan, said that NYSC had been in partnership with EFCC for a long time. Amusan said that he marched out 500 corps members to join in the sensitisation exercise because of the seriousness government attached to the fight on corruption.

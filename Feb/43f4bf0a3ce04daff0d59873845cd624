U.S. President Donald Trump, on Thursday, hailed his supporters as he celebrated his impeachment acquittal in the Senate. Democrats had impeached Trump at the House after accusing him of holding military aid to Ukraine, while asking the country to dig up dirts against Joe Biden, his political rival. On Wednesday, all but one Republican Senators voted that he was not guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. “It was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops, it was leakers and liars and this should never ever happen to another president,” Trump said at the White House in his reaction. “Fortunaltey we had great men and women that came to our defence – if we didn’t this would have been a horrific incident for our country”. He called Adam Schiff, a Democrat and leader of the impeachment investigation, as a “vicious, horrible person.” Trump insisted that he did nothing wrong and described himself as a victim of political gang-up. Trump had earlier in the day, blasted Mitt Romney for voting for his conviction. “I don’t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong,” Trump said. Romeney had explained that his “oath before God” made him vote against the president.

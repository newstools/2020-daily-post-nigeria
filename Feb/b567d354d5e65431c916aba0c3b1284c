The factional chairman of the All Progressives Congress APC in Imo State, Hon. Daniel Nwafor has appealed to the state Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma to be wary of those parading themselves on illegal authorities, insisting that there is nothing like Caretaker Committee in the state APC. Nwafor spoke during the party’s stakeholders meeting held in Owerri. He said there is only one executive structure of the party duly elected and recognized by law, having passed through both the electoral and party guidelines. Although, he admitted that what the party needs is a focused management of its affairs not internal wrangling, stressing that his leadership remains authentic. He asked that the Governor recognize his executive as the duly elected, adding that anything short of that will not augur well in the party. The state party’s leadership, according to reports has been in contention between Daniel Nwafor and Mercillus Nlemigbo. Meanwhile, Nwafor has reaffirmed the party’s full support for the new government, describing the January 14 Supreme Court judgement which brought Uzodinma to power as a victory for all. Our correspondent in Imo state reports that the meeting was made up of the three zonal chairmen of the party, the 27 LGA chairmen and secretaries, the 305 ward chairmen and their secretaries and other party stalwarts.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) call asking the Supreme Court to review its rulings on the Presidential Election and governorship elections in some states. The states are Osun, Kano, Kaduna and Katsina States. APC said the PDP had exposed the joke it has turned itself into in Nigeria. Lanre Issa-Onilu, National Publicity Secretary, in a statement Monday night, noted that never in the history of the country’s democratic journey has a political party made mockery of what a responsible opposition politics entails. It said the latest antics was no surprise and that Nigerians would recall that the APC consistently reiterated that the opposition party has been exhibiting strange behaviours at the 2015 electoral defeat. “We believe it has been difficult for some leaders of PDP to cope for so long outside of power. There is obviously a lot of idleness at the Wadata House Secretariat of PDP. “At this period that our government is working hard to ensure food sufficiency in the country, we urge those jobless characters at the Wadata House to seriously consider taking up rice farming. This would make them useful for our country”, the statemed added.

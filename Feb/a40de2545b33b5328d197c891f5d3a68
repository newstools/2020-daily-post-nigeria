Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege was, on Wednesday, inaugurated Chairman of Constitution Review Committee alongside 57 others as members. In his address, Senate President, Dr Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan urged the Committee to conduct the process of Constitution amendment on a “fast lane”, which has been the belief of the ninth Senate in the handling of legislative bills. “This level was to ensure we continued with the ninth National Assembly’s fast pace of work. We have reflected this in the reversal of our improper Budget circle, and in the swift consideration and passage of other crucial Bills. “We are now resolved to re-examine the constitution, consistent with our legislative agenda and in tandem with the yearnings of our people. “You will agree with me that reviewing the constitution is an arduous task. It requires painstaking consultation, dialogue and debate,” he said. Omo-Agege on his part revealed that the Committee understood the challenges that Nigerians were passing through, noting that amendment to the 1999 Constitution would address yearnings of Nigerians without recourse to individual whims and caprice. He further averred that they would take a far reaching consultations towards accommodating ethno-religious and ethno-social interests, insisting that the Constitution must further unite the country together. “It is worthy of note that because of the need to incorporate the interests, wishes and aspirations of the people from various ethno-religious and ethno-social backgrounds, we shall embark on far reaching consultations. “Over the years, our people appear to have been polarised along different fault lines which often make it impossible to reach the much needed consensus in some critical areas where fundamental changes are required,” he noted. DAILY POST recalls that the Committee was constituted last week Thursday by President of the Senate, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan.

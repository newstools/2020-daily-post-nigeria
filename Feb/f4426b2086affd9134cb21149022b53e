Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has named the players that will miss his side’s Premier League clash with Chelsea on Monday night at Stamford Bridge. According to Solskjaer, Marcus Rashford, Paul Pogba, Scott McTominay, Axel Tuanzebe and Fosu-Mensah are not ready to play against Frank Lampard’s men because they are yet to get full match fitness. The Norwegian said this on Friday during his pre-match press conference. “I don’t think we’ll get anyone back for the Chelsea game,” Man United’s official website quoted Solskjaer as saying. “Scotty, Axel and Tim are not ready to play against Chelsea because of their fitness level. “They did not participate so much in trainings, therefor they are not ready for Chelsea clash/ “Paul Pogba is also not ready as well and of course Marcus Rashford. “Well, how are we going to play Chelsea without Marcus, Paul, and Scott? We have to deal with it. “We have players that are going to get the opportunity to play against Chelsea. They have now had a great rest following the winter break.”

Napoli Manager, Gennaro Gattuso, has disclosed that his side would approach Lionel Messi-led Barcelona team without fear in the Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie on Tuesday night. Napoli will take on the La Liga champions at the Stadio San Paolo following a 2-1 win over Brescia in their last Serie A encounter. Speaking ahead of the clash, Gattuso said at his pre-match press conference as quoted by the Daily Mail: “We have to play against Barcelona without fear. “Lionel Messi is unbelievable because he can do things that you only see on Playstation. “We have to try and stop Messi. “We have to be ready to suffer because they would not let us touch the ball. “Barcelona can damage their opponent mentally,” he said. Barcelona head to the game after defeating Eibar 5-0 in their last La Liga encounter over the weekend.

Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said that Barcelona will not be weakened by off-field issues. A row has broken out at Camp Nou, after captain Lionel Messi hit back at director of football, Eric Abidal, who suggested some players were not working hard enough prior to Ernesto Valverde’s dismissal as coach. The situation is so serious that former Barca winger, Francisco Jose ‘Lobo’ Carrasco, claimed Messi could leave the club. Asked if Madrid could take advantage of their rivals’ issues, Zidane told reporters on Wednesday: “It’s never like that, it’s not about that. “They’re not going to be weak, they’re a very competitive team. We’re not thinking about that for one minute. “They will compete with us until the end of the season. Good players are always good.” Madrid play Real Sociedad in the quarter-final of the Copa del Rey on Thursday.

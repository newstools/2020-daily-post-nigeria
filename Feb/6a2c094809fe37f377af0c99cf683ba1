The results for the Bayelsa elections held in November 2019, is missing from the website of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), hours after the Supreme Court sacked David Lyon as the Governor-elect on Thursday. A check by DAILY POST on Friday morning showed that the results of the polls held just three months ago were unavailable. There are only results for 29 states currently available on INEC’s website. Lyon was declared winner of the elections by polling 352,552 votes, while Douye Diri got 143,172. However, Diri of the Peoples Democratic (PDP) had sought the disqualification of Lyon’s running mate, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, for allegedly falsifying his results. A panel of judges led by Mary Odili on Thursday, voided the joint ticket of Lyon and Degi-Eremienyo over certificate forgery. The apex court set aside their participation in the governorship election. The panel also ordered INEC to issue a Certificate of Return to Diri.

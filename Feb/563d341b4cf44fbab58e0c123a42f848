Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has hinted that Victor Osimhen could play as a winger for the national team. The Lille star has mostly played in a centre forward role for club and country. However, Osimhen has played wide roles for Wolfsburg and Sporting Charleroi in the past. Rohr, who recently suggested Odion Ighalo could make a return to the Eagles squad, as now said he could experiment with his front men. “But I play with real wingers, Samuel, Simon or Chukwueze. Victor Oshimen can play as well as a winger. “It’s an interesting organization to combine with the left or right back on the wings, center,” Rohr told French daily, Sud Ouest. Osimhen has scored four goals and provided two assists in his last four games for Nigeria, playing as a number nine.

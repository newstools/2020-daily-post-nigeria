Doctor Odufunke Osundare of Odufunke Memorial Hospital on Friday cautioned against the widespread belief that Chloroquine can be used to tackle the deadly Coronavirus codenamed Covid-19. Following the outbreak of the disease, some believe that the use of Chloroquine helps in tackling the scourge. However, Osundare in a chat with DAILY POST stated that only long term research can prove if Chloroquine can be used to treat Coronavirus. According to Dr Osundare: “I can wake up in the morning to say something and people will believe me because they know I’m old in the practice of medicine. Remember one Dr Abalaka once claimed to have the cure for HIV Aids and people were going to him for a cure only to discover he was a fraud. “There was a patient who was sent to him from Ilesha, Abalaka collected N10, 000 for card, N10, 000 for test before giving him Ampicloux and asked him to return home. “Research of a very long time which could last for as much as 20 years only will prove if the use of Chloroquine can tackle this virus.” This is coming at a time when the Nigerian government confirmed a case of the disease in Lagos State.

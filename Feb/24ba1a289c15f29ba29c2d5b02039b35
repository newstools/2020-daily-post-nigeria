Members of the All Progressives Congress in Imo state have taken to the streets of Owerri, the state capital to reaffirm their support for Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma. DAILY POST gathered that the solidarity rally held today was the second of its kind since after the Supreme Court judgement that returned the ex-senator as the ex-governor of the state. The rally, according to our reporter, took off at the Imo International Convention Centre IICC and came to its crescendo at the government house roundabout where the Deputy Governor, Prof. Placid Njoku, the Speaker of the House of Assembly, Rt. Chiji Collins, the Chief of Staff Barr. Nnamdi Anyaehie, SSG Sir Cosmas Iwu and various government officials spoke extensively about the new government.  Prof. Njoku while addressing the mammoth crowd, stated that hope has indeed come to the land of Imo, describing the move of the PDP to upturn the apex court judgement as null and void. He said that the party’s acceptability in the state could be traced to the massive defection of members of the House of Assembly to the ruling party as witnessed in the past few days. In the same vein, he reminded the people of the governor’s campaign promises to run a transparent and all-inclusive government. This, he said was evident in the payment of January salary of workers on 25 of last month. The soft-spoken deputy Governor, however, appealed to Imo people to be supportive of the new government in building Imo of our collective dreams.  He advised that aggrieved members of the state sheathe their war swords and align forces in moving the state forward. Other people that spoke during the rally were the Speaker, Imo State House of Assembly, Hon. Rex Anunobi and the SSG, Sir Cosmas Iwu.

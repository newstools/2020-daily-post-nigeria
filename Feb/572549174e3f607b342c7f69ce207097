Former Nigeria President, Goodluck Jonathan has said that Mrs Farida Waziri was sacked as chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), “in the national interest”. Waziri in her new book ‘Farida Waziri: One Step Ahead’, claimed that Jonathan removed her because she wanted to probe some oil racketeers. The former EFCC boss also alleged that she refused to contribute money to Jonathan’s re-election in 2011. Jonathan, in a statement by his Media Adviser, Ikechukwu Eze, however insisted her removal was a patriotic act. “It must be pointed out that former President Jonathan had no personal issues with Mrs Waziri. “The former President had to eventually let her go in the national interest. Her removal therefore has a lot to do with reasons relating to Nigeria’s interest and global standing which details Dr Goodluck Jonathan is obliged to keep as state secret in our common national interest. “It is very important to note that when dealing with the interest of the nation and the performance of the functions of a public office, a determined leader cannot prioritise the interest of an individual,” the statement read. Waziri, appointed by the late President Umaru Musa Yar’adua, was removed from office in November 2011. She served in the capacity for three and a half years.

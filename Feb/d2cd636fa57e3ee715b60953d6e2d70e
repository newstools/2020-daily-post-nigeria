Former Arsenal player, Charlie Nicholas, has predicted the UEFA Champions League last 16 first leg clash between Chelsea and Bayern Munich. Chelsea will host Bayern Munich at Stamford Bridge after beating Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League over the weekend. Providing his prediction, Nicholas told Sky Sports: “Chelsea got a very good result against Tottenham; I did anticipate that if they started Olivier Giroud, they would get something. “Chelsea are still unpredictable despite what Frank Lampard is doing at Stamford Bridge. “He is playing the youngsters and that is fantastic. “But I think feel there is a vulnerability in the team. “Bayern Munich destroyed Tottenham in England but I believe the Bundesliga champions have regressed since Jupp Heynckes took charge of the club. “They play narrower with Philippe Coutinho and Serge Gnabry. “But I see Bayern beating Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. I do not believe Lampard’s men are at this standard yet.”

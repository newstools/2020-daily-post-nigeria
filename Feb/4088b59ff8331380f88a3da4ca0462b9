The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu says no tertiary institution will admit candidates outside the Central Admission Process System (CAPS) of the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB). He urged candidates expected to sit for the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) to refrain from examination malpractice and admission racketeering. NAN reports that Adamu spoke at the commissioning of JAMB’s New General Services Department building on Monday at the headquarters in Bwari, Abuja. Adamu noted that the introduction of CAPS has revolutionized admission process in the interest of candidates, irrespective of where they come from, gender or social status. “CAPS ensure due process, fairness, discipline and equity in the process; it is through the automated system that ordinary Nigerians are now hopeful of not being denied the rightful place in the admission exercise. “It is instructive that CAPS protects the traditional rights of the Senate and Academic Board of the institutions. “This is because CAPS does not allow anyone other than the Admission officer, Vice-Chancellor, Provost or Rector, to initiate, propose or recommend any candidate for admission but also requires the documentation. “Permit me to state that leadership of any higher institution found to be involved in admitting any candidate without prior approval of the Board or outside the established CAPS would be considered and treated as corrupting the admission process,” he said. JAMB Registrar, Prof. Is-haq Oloyede stated that the board would conduct the 2020 mock UTME on Tuesday, Feb. 18 in 64 accredited centres, nationwide. Oloyede said that about 350,000 candidates were expected to sit for the exercise, which follows immediately after the end of the board’s 2020 UTM/Direct Entry (DE) registration exercise on Monday, Feb. 17.

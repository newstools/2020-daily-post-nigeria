Oyo State Government, on Thursday said it has sealed a petroleum station under construction in Ibadan, the state capital. The government said that the petroleum station was sealed based on negative impact the facility would have on a nearby Primary School and persons living within the premises. Commissioner for Environment and Natural Resources, Kehinde Ayoola, in a statement made available to DAILY POST revealed that the State Government issued the directive, following petitions received from residents and business owners. The petroleum station, which is under construction at Apata area within Ibadan metropolis is situated very close to St. Michael’s Primary school, Apata, Ibadan and other business facilities. Ayoola, who visited the site, along with Environmental Health Officers of the State, said the visit was aimed at assessing the environmental impact of the construction site and take measures that would promote a friendly environment devoid of environmental threats, particularly the pupils of the School. “As a responsive and responsible government, the safety and well-being of residents is paramount to us, which must not be compromised most importantly when a school is involved. “Governor Seyi Makinde’s administration, having education as one of its cardinal agenda, would not allow anything to hinder the success of its education of our pupils,” he said. “We have to put a stop work order and seal up this facility considering the fact that it does not have environmental impact assessment report and some other necessary permit that regulates environmental activities of the State,” he added. Ayoola further said that though the state encourages myriad of business opportunities and entrepreneurship development, business activities should not be carried out at the detriment of the people.

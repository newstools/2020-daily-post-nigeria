The Taraba State Government has dismissed calls for the impeachment of Governor Darius Ishaku. Ishaku has been in Abuja since December and the government insists this did not in any way constitute an impeachable offence. Bala Abu, Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Media, in a statement Thursday night, said the governor is staying in Abuja to recuperate from a domestic accident he earlier suffered. He described those calling for the governor’s impeachment as unpatriotic people bent on promoting “inanities and outright falsehood.” “We urge the good people of Taraba, their friends and admirers in and outside the state to ignore the campaign of falsehood being orchestrated by some people. “His Excellency is desirous to return to the state and will do so when he has sufficiently recovered. No aspect of governmental activities has suffered a setback as a result. “All government projects are going on smoothly and government has continued to meet its obligations to contractors while progress are being monitored by appropriate government ministries and officials,” Abu added. He stressed that the 2020 budget was being implemented with vigour while salaries of workers, pensions and gratuities are also being paid promptly. Abu stated that it was misleading to suggest that Ishaku’s absence has affected the civil service and governance in Taraba. “The Governor is not on vacation and he is not unable to discharge the duties of his office. He has been conducting his official duties diligently”, the spokesman said.

New Manchester United attacker, Odion Ighalo, has revealed that the club lacks a striker who stays mostly in the middle of the opponent’s box this season. The Nigerian striker will play for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men, after agreeing on a six-month loan with Man United from Shanghai Shenhua on transfer deadline day. Speaking ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash with Chelsea on January 17, the 30-year-old told MUTV: “I watch Man Utd’s matches and sometimes they lack a striker who stays mostly in the middle of the opponent’s box. “The likes of Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford enjoy coming from the outside of the box. “The Red Devils need a player in the middle of the attack who can keep and hold the ball. “As I have watched many United’s matches, they need that physical presence there in the middle. “This I believe I can improve to the team under Solskjaer, if everything goes fine.”

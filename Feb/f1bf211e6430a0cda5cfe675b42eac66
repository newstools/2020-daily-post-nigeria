The prosecutor, Inspector Elisha Olusegun informed the court that the defendants committed the offence on February 10, 2020, at PDP Secretariat Osogbo.

He added that the offence committed are contrary and punishable under section 516,320(1) ,355,351,249(d) law of Osun state 2002 The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to five-count charge leveled against them by the police. The two defence counsels, Sina Adeniran and Nurudeen Kareem urged the court to grant their clients bail in the most liberal terms, as they promised that none of the defendants would jump bail, adding that they would also provide reliable sureties to stand for them. But the prosecutor opposed the bail application, informing the court that the offence committed remained heinous and that if they were granted bail, there was high possibility of jumping bail as well as influencing witnesses in the matter. In his ruling, the Magistrate , O.A Ayilara ordered the remand of the defendants at Ilesa Correctional centre. He thereby adjourned the matter till March 6, 2020 for ruling on bail.

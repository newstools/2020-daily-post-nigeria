Osun State government, on Thursday, endorsed the draft bill for the establishment of Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN) codenamed “Operation Amotekun”. Ismail Omipindan, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Gboyega Oyetola confirmed the endorsement to newsmen in Osogbo, the capital of Osun state, adding that the action was taken at an emergency meeting of the State Executive Council. According to him, the endorsed bill was immediately transmitted to the State House of Assembly for consideration and possible ratification. “The Executive Council had emergency meeting today to consider just one item and that was the Amotekun draft bill. “Amotekun draft bill has been endorsed by the State Executive Council and the state Council sent it to the House of Assembly for further considerations”, Omipindan said through a short message. Recall that the six governors of the South West geo-political zone recently launched operation Amotekun as a regional security outfit to complement Federal security arrangement in the region, following series of security breaches. Meanwhile, the Minister of Justice and Attorney -General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami consequently described the outfit as illegal, for lacking requisite law and parliamentary instrument to define its mode of operation, which necessitated the move by the governments of the six states to initiate process of legal framework.

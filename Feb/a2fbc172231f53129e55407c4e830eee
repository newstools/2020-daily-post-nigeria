One of the four abducted seminarians of the Good Shepherd Seminary, at the outskirts of Kaduna State, has been found dead. Michael Nnadi was kidnapped alongside three other seminarians from his school a few weeks ago but was declared missing after the Kidnappers released three others. He was later found dead late Saturday evening. DAILY POST recalls that three of the students regained their freedom on Friday, but Michael was still missing. According to a statement by the Registrar of the institution, Dr. Rev. Fr. Joel Usman, ‘it is sad that the missing student was found dead’. “This is to inform all our friends and well-wishers that the remaining abducted Seminarian has been found dead. ” Thank you very much for your prayerful support. Let us keep praying for Nigeria in Great Distress. ” Please let us remain faithful in the Risen Lord. May the soul of our Brother Nnadi Michael and the souls of all the faithful departed rest in peace with the Lord. Amen.” He said

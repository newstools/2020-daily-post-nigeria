Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has lamented his side’s form after a 1-0 defeat at Levante on Saturday. The loss means Los Blancos have dropped five points within a week and are now two points behind leaders Barcelona. Jose Morales’ second half goal proved to be the difference between the two sides at Ciutat de Valencia. “We failed at the most important thing in football and that’s to score. It’s screwed up because in a week we’ve dropped five points, but this is football. “We didn’t deserve that today. We went from more to less. They made their shots count. We can’t look back now. “My players gave everything and I’m annoyed. Losing five points in two games is a bad moment for us. We’re playing for everything this week. We’ve got to keep our heads up. We’ve had good moments before and now we’re in a bad one but we’ll come out of this,” Zidane told reporters after the game. Real Madrid’s next fixture, will be a home game against Manchester City in the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday.

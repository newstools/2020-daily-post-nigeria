The Nigeria Police on Monday said GUO, Ezenwata and Young Shall Grow luxury buses were not hijacked by bandits on the Lokoja-Okene road. This was contained in a statement in Lokoja by the Kogi State Police Command spokesman, DSP William Aya. He said some persons were attempting to manipulate “the mindsets of Nigerians and the good people of the State that, Kogi State is not safe.” “Such incident never occurred in Kogi State and the Command has not received any such report. “The Commissioner urged the law abiding citizens of the state to go about their lawful businesses and to always avail the security agencies with credible information on the existence of criminal elements in the state,” he said. Aya also assured residents and Nigerians travelling through the state of police renewed commitment to the protection of lives and property.

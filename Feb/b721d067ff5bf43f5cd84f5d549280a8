Biafra agitators, under the aegis of Biafra Zionists Federation, BZF, on Tuesday, asked Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State to vacate office within two weeks. The group gave the ultimatum through its self-acclaimed President, Barr. Benjamin Onwuka. This is as he faulted the prophecy of Enugu Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr. Ejike Mbaka, stressing that “God deals with facts not hearsay” He claimed that Uzodinma is “an impostor who will never enjoy the support of Imo people owing to lack of legitimacy.” “We have watched with keen interest in developments in Imo State and have now come out to make our stand known. “Our position is that a man who could not win even one local government area cannot preside over the affairs of Imo people,” Onwuka declared. He noted that though the Zionists were ‘Biafrans’, they would not fold their hands and watch the destiny of their people pilfered away. The Zionists leader declared that “Imo State is part of Biafra land and for that reason, there is no way an impostor will come from nowhere to govern them. What is happening in Imo State affects every Igbo man. “They clearly chose their governor through the ballot, so we are at a loss on how someone will jump from 4th to 1st position through the magic calculation of the court. “We have it on good authority that Uzodinma was brought in as part of the game plan to actualize the Islamization and Ruga agenda, but it will not stand. “He has two weeks to vacate that seat and allow the rightful occupier, Emeka Ihedioha serve out his term.” Onwuka also sounded a note of warning against defecting Imo lawmakers, saying that “they are going to pay a heavy price for that.” He condemned the recent arrest of some of his members in Enugu, describing the action of the police as provocative.

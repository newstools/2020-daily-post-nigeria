Borussia Dortmund striker, Erling Haaland, has warned his side after setting a record in their UEFA Champions League 2-1 win against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday night. Haaland, who becomes the first player as a debutant in the Champions League to score ten goals in the competition so far, said Dortmund still have a lot of work to do against PSG in the return leg in Paris in order to qualify for the Champions League quarter-finals. The 19-year-old scored twice against PSG at the Westfalenstadion Stadium to give Dortmund a first-leg advantage ahead of the return match next month as Neymar’s strike was not enough give Thomas Tuchel’s men a draw. “We want to qualify for the last eight, but we know it will be difficult,” Haaland told reporters after the game at Westfalenstadion. “The outcome of today’s game is a bit dangerous because PSG has a very strong team. “They [PSG] can still qualify ahead of us when we face them in Paris in the second leg, but Dortmund has a good team.”

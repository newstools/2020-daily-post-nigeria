Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has called on the Presidency, Inspector General of Police, and National Security Adviser, NSA, Babagana Monguno to stop Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, from causing civil unrest in the state. Obaseki urged them to stop Oshiomhole from making his state ungovernable and ensuring the safety of the people of the state. In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, the governor alleged that Oshiomhole’s grand plot was to cause unrest which would lead to state of emergency being declared in the state. The statement reads: “This, we believe, is part of Comrade Oshiomhole’s grand plan to make the state seem ungovernable so that he would only achieve his ambition of forcing the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency in Edo but also cause chaos and civil unrest. “We again call on the Presidency, the Inspector General of Police and the National Security Adviser to rein in Comrade Oshiomhole and stop him from continuing with his insidious intentions so as to safeguard law-abiding residents and indigenes of Edo State.” Speaking with DAILY POST on the faceoff, Yekini Nabena, Deputy National Publicity Secretary of APC, said a committee led by Bisi Akande has been set up to reconcile the aggrieved members. “You will realise that the party has set up a reconciliation committee headed by Bisi Akande which is looking into it. “Let’s wait for their report on the issue,” Nabena said. Obaseki and Oshiomhole have been involved in an alleged face-off over who heads the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state. The face-off led to Obaseki threatening to expel Oshiomhole from the state chapter of the party.

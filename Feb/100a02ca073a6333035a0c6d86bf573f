Former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has faulted the ban of motorcycles popularly called Okada by the Lagos State government. Omokri warned that rendering people unemployed would lead to increased insecurity in the state and the country. In a tweet, the former presidential aide reminded the Lagos State government that the ban on commercial motorcycles might lead to a surge in the activities of Boko Haram as the terrorists were currently recruiting. “We are already the world headquarters for extreme poverty and you ban commercial motorcyclists? What do you expect over one million motorcyclists to do? You render them unemployed. Meanwhile Boko Haram is employing. Expect a surge in terrorism!,” he wrote. Recall that the Lagos State Government had banned the operation of commercial motorcycles and tricycles in six local government areas and nine local council development areas in the state. The state government had disclosed that the embargo was to take effect from February 1st, 2020. A statement by the state’s Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Gbenga Omotosho, said the government had placed the ban due to the havoc the motorcyclists cause in those communities.

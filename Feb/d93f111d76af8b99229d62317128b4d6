Juventus midfielder, Aaron Ramsey, has called on his teammates to focus on themselves and work hard following their 1-0 defeat to Lyon in the Champions League round of 16 first leg encounter on Wednesday night. He also wants Juventus to improve on their performances going forward. Lyon defeated Maurizio Sarri’s men in France, thanks to a lone goal from Lucas Tousart to give the French Ligue 1 side a narrow win over the Serie A champions. Speaking after the match, Ramsey was quoted by Juventus’ official website as saying: “We knew it was going to be difficult against Lyon, but we did not play the game we wanted. “We have much work to do, but I am confident because we are a united group. “This is only the first half, and now we work hard. Let’s focus on ourselves and do better than we did today: starting on Sunday with Inter. “For the return leg, we want to secure a result in front of the fans.” Juventus will host Lyon in the second leg in Turin next month.

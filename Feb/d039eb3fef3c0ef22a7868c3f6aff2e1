Former heavyweight champions, Mike Tyson, has backed British fighter, Tyson Fury to beat American boxer, Deontay Wilder, in their WBC heavyweight championship rematch on February 22 in Las Vegas. Fury and Wilder’s first fight in 2018 ended in a controversial draw. “I like Fury and Wilder as fighters,” the 53-year-old said as quoted by Metro UK. “We have to respect them, and I was in their shoes before, they both came from nothing and have now achieved becoming heavyweight champions. “I supported Tyson Fury in the first fight, I am his fan, and he is a nice person. “I hope he wins because he was named after me, and he just kept beating decent fighters.”

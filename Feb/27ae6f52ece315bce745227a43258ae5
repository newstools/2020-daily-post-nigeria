Dortmund striker, Erling Braut Haaland, on Saturday, set a new record after scoring a brace in his side’s Bundesliga 5-0 victory over Union Berlin. Dortmund defeated Berlin at home, thanks to goals from Haaland (2), Jadon Sancho (1), Marco Reus (1), and Axel Witsel (1). Haaland’s two goals against the visitors mean the Norwegian youngster has now become the first Bundesliga player to score score goals in his first three games, according to Live Soccer TV. The 19-year-old has scored with each of his first seven shots on target for Dortmund. DAILY POST had reported that Haaland joined Dortmund from Red Bull Salzburg last month. He has signed a contract with the Bundesliga giants until the summer of 2024. Haaland will now hope to lead Dortmund to victory when they take on Bayer in their next fixture on February 8.

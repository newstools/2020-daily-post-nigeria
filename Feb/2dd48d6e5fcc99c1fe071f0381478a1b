Former Barcelona midfielder, Emmanuel Petit, has said that the playing days of Lionel Messi are numbered. Petit warned Manchester United and Newcastle City against signing the Argentine, adding that a move for Messi will makes no sense. The former France international said City and United should forget about signing Messi, saying that the player is not built for the Premier League like Cristiano Ronaldo was. Petit spent three years at Arsenal and Chelsea and a year at Barca. He said: “Honestly, I don’t think he’s suited to the intensity of England,” according to the Mirror. “He doesn’t like being closed down and being fought. In Spain, he’s protected.” Petit explained that though it would be a pleasure for fans of the Premier League to see Messi, he does not see why a club like Manchester City , for example, would move for Messi at 32 or 33. He said if City and United wanted to sign the Barcelona star, they should have done so a couple of years ago. “Messi is not Cristiano Ronaldo. Physically, he’s not the same machine, he added. “Ronaldo is a monster but, at 32, Messi has only one or two more years playing at the highest level. “Even playing alongside great players at Barca, he won’t have the same pace or the dribbling ability.

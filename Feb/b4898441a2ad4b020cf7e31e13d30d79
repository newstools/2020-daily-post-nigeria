The Acting Managing Director of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Joi Nunieh has denied awarding 300 different contracts to a serving Senator. He spoke at a budget defence of the agency in Abuja. The NDDC boss’s reaction followed reports in the media to the effect that such contracts were awarded with 150 out of 300 fully paid without execution. “Let me make clarification before the Senate Committee on Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC); there was nothing like that. “I am not denying because am here for the defence of the agency’s budget for 2020, I have no knowledge of such contracts.” A statement credited to a Director of Operations in NDDC, Cairo Ojuogboh had accused a serving Senator of being the beneficiary of 300 contracts from NDDC, with 150 of them completely paid without executing any. Responding to further questions from lawmakers, the Managing Director said the statement was baseless and unfounded. In his reaction, Senator James Manager representing Delta South expressed satisfaction at the NDDC, but cautioned strongly against the wilful attempts to tarnish the reputation of Senators.

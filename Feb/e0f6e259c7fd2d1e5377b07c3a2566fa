Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, is set to ditch Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Mesut Ozil and Alexandre Lacazette this summer, the UK Sun reports. Aubameyang has been heavily linked with Barcelona and is expected to move on after this season, when he will have one year left on his current contract. The Gunners will offload the Gabon striker if he fails to agree fresh terms. Arteta is looking for a new no. 10 ahead of next season, which means Mesut Ozil will be allowed to leave. Ozil’s form has been in decline, but he remains the highest-paid Arsenal player. Lacazette’s last goal in all competitions, was against Standard Liege in the Europa League in December, with the Frenchman looking short of confidence. Arteta is planning a massive shake-up and wants to conclude his transfer business before the European Championships.

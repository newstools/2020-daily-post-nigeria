Manchester United will be without not less than seven of their first team players when they file out against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Monday. The club’s January signing, Odion Ighalo will travel with the squad to West London but manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer refused to confirm whether the Nigerian striker will play against the Blues. Ighalo has been training away from the rest of the Red Devils squad since his arrival from China due to the fear of Coronavirus. Young forward, Scott McTominay is still working on his fitness during the winter break as he looks to return from a knee injury. Although Axel Tuanzebe and Tim Fosu-Mensah have stepped-up their rehab they won’t be available against Chelsea. Midfielder Paul Pogba is still out following ankle surgery, while Lee Grant and Marcus Rashford won’t be seen for several weeks due to different degrees of injuries. Former Blues star, Nemanja Matic will also miss a return to Stamford Bridge due to suspension. Manchester United will be without a number of players for Premier League Monday night clash. “I never said he [Ighalo] was going to be ready to play on Monday. He’ll be involved with us and he’ll travel down with us and, obviously, now he’s out of that two-week period of precaution and it’s a precaution we’ve made,” Solskjaer told Manchester United official website. “He’ll travel with us and let’s see if he’s involved or not. He’s done his [training programme] and it was always going to be a case of him having to integrate into the group anyway after having been out in China. “He needs to get used to the players and the team and up to speed as quick as he can.” “I don’t think we’ll get anyone back for the Chelsea game. Because Scotty, Axel, Tim, they didn’t join too much so they’re not ready to play that game. And Paul is not ready, of course.”

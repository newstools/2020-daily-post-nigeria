Manchester United have agreed a six-month loan deal for Odion Ighalo with Shanghai Shenhua. The Premier League club announced it just before the January transfer window slam shut on Friday night. “Odion is an experienced player. He will come in and give us an option of a different type of centre-forward for the short spell he’s staying with us,” he said. “A great lad and very professional, he will make the most of his time here,” United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, said. The UK Mirror reports that Ighalo has less than two years left on his £300,000-a-week deal at Shanghai, with United agreeing to pay him £150,000-a-week for the remainder of this season. There will also be a £5million loan fee, with both clubs set to review the situation at the end of the season in view of a permanent deal.

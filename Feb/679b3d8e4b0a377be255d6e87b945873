The Zamfara State Police Command has denied reports that it was aware of any ransom paid to kidnappers for the release of the district head of Gayari in Gummi Local Government Area of the state, Alhaji Hassan Mohammed who was abducted alongside his son last week. SP Mohammed Shehu, the state Police Public Relation Officer (PPRO) said the command was not aware of any ransom paid to the kidnappers for the release of the district head. The police spokesman explained that the command’s tactical team is making frantic efforts to get the son of the district head who is yet to be released by the kidnappers “The command has not received any information about ransom paid or that the abductors are demanding for ransom or motorcycles to release the son of the district head,” he said. SP Shehu said that the command has warned anyone who intends to pay any ransom to kidnappers to inform the police first so that the police can lay ambush to apprehend the abductors. He said that if the relatives of the kidnapped victims paid ransom to the kidnappers, then they have complicated issues. He decried the trend of relatives of kidnapped victims paying ransom and running to the media to rubbish security operatives in the state.

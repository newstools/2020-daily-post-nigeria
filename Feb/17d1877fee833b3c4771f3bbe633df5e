A former lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has reacted to the alleged killing of Nigerian footballer, Tiyamu Kazeem, by the police. It was reported earlier that the Remo Stars Football Club (RSFC) Assistant Captain, also known as Kaka was killed by a policeman from the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) from the Ogun State Command. The incident occurred Saturday afternoon in Sagamu while he was driving along Sagamu area of the State with one of his teammates, Sanni Abubakar. The SARS officer was said to have stopped the footballer to label him a Yahoo Boy and they insisted on taking him to the nearby police station. Sani, a former lawmaker representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, in a tweet on Sunday condemned the action of the police. He wrote, “The death of Remo Stars Assistant Captain Tiyamu Kazeem in the hands of the police is tragic and unfortunate. “May Allah grant him Aljanna condolences to the family of the deceased.”

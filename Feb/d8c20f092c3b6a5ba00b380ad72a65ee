Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has denied Fred’s claim that there are “lots of problems” in the dressing room. Fred, in a recent interview, claimed there was disunity within the squad. But Solskjaer is adamant that is not the case and is not sure why Fred has that impression – though insists his comments will not affect his place in the team. Asked about Fred’s remarks, Solskjaer told a press conference on Friday: “This group sticks together, don’t worry about that. “I haven’t seen the interview or I don’t understand what he’s saying. “I’ve seen him sat there in the kitchen. Fred knows this is a group that wants to give everything for each other. “I don’t know how to interpret what he said but I’ve got no issues at all and I’ve got no issues with the group doing everything for each other.”

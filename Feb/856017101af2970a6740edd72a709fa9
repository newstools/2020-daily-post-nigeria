The Social Democratic Party, SDP in Jigawa state, said they joined the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to redeem the lost glory of the State for over five years of APC administration. Gubernatorial candidate of the Social Democratic Party, SDP, of the 2019 general election in Jigawa State, Alhaji Bashir Adamu Jumbo stated this while speaking to newsmen on their recent defection to PDP. DAILY POST reported that SDP Gubernatorial candidate, his Deputy and the entire party in the state and local government have dumped the party for PDP. He explained that the move started since after the 2019 general election to save Jigawa State people and redeem the state’s lost glory. “We are not desperate politicians who think about themselves alone. The move is to protect the interest of the people that have confidence in us. “We left the APC to SDP because we have been thrown out of the party. We tried to integrate so that Jigawa people will get better out of it” “We also left SDP because it doesn’t have the l national outlook and it might not be the platform to get the people of the state to the promised land” He said PDP has ruled the country for sixteen years and succeeded in human and capital development. “Look at the eight years of the former Governor of the state, Alh. Sule Lamido and year of current serving Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar, you will see the remarkable difference”. Jumbo has served as member Federal House of Representative Kazaure, Gwiwa, Roni and Yankwashi constituency for sixteen years.

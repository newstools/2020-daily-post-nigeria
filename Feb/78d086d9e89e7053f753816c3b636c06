Manchester United have officially announced Odion Ighalo’s transfer. The Nigerian striker agreed a six-month loan deal with the Premier League champions on transfer deadline day last Friday. However, the club remained quiet until Tuesday morning, when it was confirmed he would wear the no. 25 shirt. United, later in the evening, posted a picture of Ighalo holding their home jersey. “Here he is! First interview with @ighalojude as an #MUFC player, coming soon… Watch this space,” read the caption. Ighalo, who has previously played in England for Watford, is in line to make his debut for the Red Devils away to Chelsea after the winter break.

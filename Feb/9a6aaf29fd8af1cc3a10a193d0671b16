The Police Command in Ekiti State has arrested one Olarewaju Oluwaseun, for alleging a herdsman attack. ASP Abutu Sunday, the command spokesman in a statement on Sunday, said Oluwaseun is a driver who ply the Akure-Ilorin route. Sunday said the driver lied to the Police Control Room, in Ado-Ekiti, that he was attacked and robbed of N27,000, by one Quadri Isah, a herdsman rearing his cattle along Awo Ekiti/ Igede Ekiti road. The PPRO said Safer Highways Patrol Team responded and rushed to the scene of the alleged. There, the patrol team actually met the complaint and Isah but discovered the former had earlier injured the suspect with a jackknife as against his claim. The duo were later moved to the State Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) for further investigation and upon interrogation, Isah explained that he was only trying to control his cows to cross to the other side of the road when he was accosted by Oluwaseun Isah said the driver felt his cattle were blocking the road and therefore, angrily alighted from his vehicle, picked a jackknife from his vehicle and stabbed him severally. The Police said during investigation, the complainant’s vehicle was searched and the N27,000 he earlier claimed he was robbed as well as the knife which he used to stab Isah was recovered “The complainant, thereafter confessed that he lied against the herdsman and that the earlier information he gave to the police was false,” it added. “The Command therefore, wishes to debunk the earlier information by Oluwaseun that he was attacked and robbed by the herdsman. “The information was totally false and maliciously fabricated for a selfish interest. Neither was Oluwaseun nor anybody attacked along Awo Ekiti/Igede Ekiti road,” he said. Abutu quoted the Commissioner of Police, Amba Asuquo, has appealing citizens to ensure that information given to the police, the people around them and others were always accurate and timely.

The President of the Senate, Ahmed Lawan and 24 other Senators including Owelle Rochas Okorocha have paid their last tribute to late Senator Benjamin Uwajumogu whose remains was laid to rest at his country home, Umuiyi in Ihitte-Uboma LGA. Ahmed Lawal, in his eulogy described the late Senator as a peaceful, committed and reliable legislator who catered for his people without any fear or favour. “Ben Uwajumogu will be remembered for his struggle for national unity. Indeed, he was an active parliamentarian.” “The National Assembly will continue to protect the interest of the nation.” Lawan urged Uwajimogu’s immediate family to take solace in the fact that the late Senator left behind endearing legacies, although, he said his demise was one of the most shocking news for the nation. Speaking, the Governor of Imo state, Senator Hope Uzodinma said, indeed, Imo and Nigeria at large have lost a rare gem. He eulogized the late Senator on his efforts to attract development to his people while he represented them at National Assembly. To this end, the Governor announced the renaming of the College of Education Ihitte-Uboma to Benjamin Uwajumogu College of Education. This, he said was to immortalize the late Senator who fought doggedly to shoot his constituency and Imo in general to political limelight. “The entire Imo people and Nigerians will mourn him. This is indeed not the best of time for Imo people.” “We will continue to reminisce on his kind gestures, his sense of unity and love.” DAILY POST reports that Uwajimogus funeral was a gathering of political, academic and traditional creme-dela-creme of Imo state and Nigerians at large including the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba who represented the President, Muhammadu Buhari.

Three men, on Monday, died in a ghastly road accident along Lagos-Ibadan highway. DAILY POST gathered that 14 other persons sustained various levels of injuries in the accident that happened around Saapade axis of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Two vehicles were involved in the accident: a Mazda bus with registration number, AKD 53 XN, coming from Ibadan to Lagos and a Ford bus with registration number, GB 490 XA, coming from Lagos to Ikire. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps, confirmed the accident to DAILY POST. TRACE Spokesperson, Cdr Babatunde Akinbiyi, told our correspondent that the two vehicles had a head-on collision due to speeding and reckless driving. Akinbiyi informed that the Injured victims have been rescued to Victory Hospital, Ogere; State Hospital, Isara and OOUTH, Sagamu; adding that the dead victims were taken to FOS Mortuary, Ipara, all in Ogun State. He stated further that the driver of the Ford bus coming from Lagos to Ikire was among the dead victims, while the other two are among the passengers in the Mazda bus. “While TRACE Corps commiserates with the family of the dead, motorists are again warned to avoid overspeeding and reckless driving at diversion/construction areas because of its attendant consequences.
“Rather, they should uphold the 50kmph speed limit,” Akinbiyi advised.

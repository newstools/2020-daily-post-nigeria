Juventus have reportedly decided to sell midfielder, Aaron Ramsey at the end of the season. Ramsey only joined the Serie A champions last summer from Premier League giants, Arsenal as a free agent. The Welsh international has not impressed at Allianz, and muscle injuries have hindered his first campaign with Juventus. The 29-year-old has made just 19 appearances in all competitions for Maurizio Sarriâ€™s side this season, scoring two goals. But Tuttosport is reporting that Juventus are looking to offload Ramsey in the summer transfer window. The Bianconeri are willing to make a little profit on the midfielder, having signed him on a free transfer last year.

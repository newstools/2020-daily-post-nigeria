Hundreds of Borno State residents booed President Muhammadu Buhari and his entourage on Wednesday. Buhari is currently in the state on a “sympathy visit.” As he moved through town, the people shouted “Ba ma so, ba ma yi” in Hausa language. The translation is English is “We don’t want, we are not interested.” As Buhari’s convoy passed, the crowd booed as they waved their hands in rejection. The president arrived Maiduguri after his arrival from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia. His spokesman, Garba Shehu said the visit to Borno followed the killing of 30 persons in Auno. The terrorists, who stormed the area at about 9:50 pm on Sunday, also destroyed about 18 vehicles and abducted some persons. Maiduguri people booing the clueless @MBuhari ‘Ba ma so’ means we don’t want you again. @AishaYesufu @drwai @Galadancii @Usmankarofi01 pic.twitter.com/p6vxl4A7jC — Revolutionary Mystic (@BaqeerG) February 12, 2020

The All Progressives Congress (APC) has announced plan to seek a reversal of the decision of the Independent National Electoral Commission (lNEC) to issue certificate of return to Bayelsa Governor-elect, Sen. Douye Diri. APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, told newsmen on Friday that the nullification of the election of the party’s governorship candidate, David Lyon, was an injustice that favoured the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He stated that the APC recognises that having issued certificate to PDP candidate, “there are viable legal windows that will be explored”. “We affirm our confidence in the judiciary even with pains in our hearts. “The Supreme Court for good reason, gave a conditional order that INEC should swear in the second candidate with the highest number of votes and the required constitutional spread.” “Clearly, the votes scored by PDP and its candidate in that election only met requirements in five Local Government Areas (LGAs) and you need six LGAs to meet the requirement of two third. PDP candidate did not satisfy this requirement,” Oshiomhole added.

Barcelona attacking midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, has paid tribute to Liverpool for their outstanding performance in the Premier League so far this season. Coutinho, a former Liverpool star, also said that he was not surprised by the Reds’ success this term, insisting that he did not regret leaving Jurgen Klopp’s side. The Brazilian international, who is currently on loan at Bayern Munich, left Liverpool in January 2018 for Barcelona. Liverpool are presently on top of the Premier League table with 22 points ahead of second-place Manchester City. “I am not surprised that Liverpool is hovering this season,” Coutinho was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “They have a great team and coach. “Everyone saw them last season as they won the UEFA Champions League. “I am so delighted for Liverpool because I have many friends, including ex-teammates at Anfield. “I am so glad for them, and that is all. I don’t look back. I took another pathway, just like everyone else. “I’m focused entirely on this new journey and hoping to reach my dreams just like everyone else. “I am delighted with what I did in the past at Anfield, and now I can only look forward.”

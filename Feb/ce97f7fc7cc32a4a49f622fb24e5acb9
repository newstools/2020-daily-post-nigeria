Former Holland ace, Ruud Gullit, has warned Virgil van Dijk that he would never win the Ballon d’Or prize. Van Dijk narrowly lost out to Lionel Messi in 2019, finishing in second place. The Liverpool defender was considered one of the favourites to win it, after helping the Premier League side win the Champions League and finish second in the league. However, the Dutchman had to settle for the runner-up spot as Messi claimed the prize for a record sixth time. Although the 28-year-old is enjoying yet another impressive campaign, which is expected to see Jurgen Klopp’s side win a first league title in 30 years, Gullit doesn’t think his compatriot will have a better chance to take home the Golden Ball. “The message of the Ballon d’Or was, he’s never going to win it again,” he told JOE. Asked if he thought the Liverpool defender deserved to beat Messi to the Ballon d’Or, Gullit continued: “Yeah, I think he should. But, you know, you can’t say Messi didn’t deserve it either. “But if there was a possibility to make a stand for a defender, it was this year.” Van Dijk would have been the first defender to claim the Ballon d’Or since 2006, when Italian centre-back Fabio Cannavaro won it.

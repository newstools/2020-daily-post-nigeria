The Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) on Saturday recovered wreckage of a burnt truck laden with cardboard papers and other combustible materials on 3rd Mainland Bridge. Dr. Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, Director General of LASEMA, who made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), said a truck laden with several bundles/packs of cardboard papers and other combustible materials got burnt at third mainland bridge on Friday. He further said investigations showed that while a LASTMA tow truck was deployed, it could not recover the wreckage due to the weight of the burnt vehicle exceeding the capacity of the LASTMA tow truck. “According to investigations, the burnt truck has a registration number XN 561 AKD. “The fire has now been extinguished very close to the Adeniji Adele junction inward. “There were no lives lost and no injuries, while preliminary investigations indicated that electrical sparks emanating from the engine probably caused the fire that burnt the truck. “The driver of the burnt truck was not at the scene of the incident to further explain the incident and how it escalated to uncontrollable levels. “The fire was finally extinguished by the efforts of the Federal Fire Service whose team arrived first from their Campbell Street base, supported by efforts of the Lagos State Fire Service.”

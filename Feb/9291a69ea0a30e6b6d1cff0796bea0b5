The Bauchi State chapter of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria, MACBAN, has expressed worry over the continuous clash between herdsmen and farmers in the state. Chairman of MACBAN in the state, Sadiq Ahmed, said peace would only return when the state government provides cattle colonies, grazing reserves, and veterinary services for herdsmen in the state. Ahmed lamented that the persistent clashes between farmers and herdsmen in the state have led to a setback in the socio-economic development of the state and Nigeria in general. Speaking in Bauchi on Friday, Ahmed said: “The challenges facing Fulani herdsmen in the state include lack of cattle colonies, grazing reserves and lack of government intervention in the provision of veterinary services.
“These are our challenges and we want the government to address these issues so that peace can be restored in our state and country. “This is the area we are calling for the support of stakeholders in the country to bring to the front burner of national issues these challenges of Fulani herdsmen so that both state and federal government can look into these issues and bring a lasting solution to them.”

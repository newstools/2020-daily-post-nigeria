The National Youth Service Corps(NYSC) has raised alarm over fraudulent activities of some individuals who place online advertisement for deployment and redeployment of Corp members to states of their choices. The scheme says such activities being currently circulated online with a title known as “Henroozy Koncept” through a soft copy flier is fake and fraudulent with criminal intent. This was contained in a statement signed by the Coordinator of the scheme for Southwest Area Office, Mr Emmanuel Attah, and made available to newsmen in Osogbo, Osun State capital. It stated that the National Youth Service Corps had never authorised any group, organization or individual to perform such function or any other functions related to the NYSC mobilisation. According to the statement, the issue of deployment and redeployment are done exclusively by the NYSC, based on statutory provision and in compliance with Federal Character, Unity and peaceful coexistence of Nigeria. The statement reads in part:” The NYSC, therefore, warns prospective graduates or those already mobilised not to pay money to anyone in person or by account for the purpose of deployment or redeployment, as they might be doing so at their own risk. “The scheme’s National Headquarters in Abuja was already investigating the unscrupulous people behind the scam, with an assurance that upon arrest their prosecution would be made public”. It further appealed to parents and guardians of graduates of tertiary institutions to desist from the practice of trying to come through the back door as such attract the wrath of the law if caught.

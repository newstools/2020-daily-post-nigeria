The prize money Liverpool players will get if they win this season’s English Premier League (EPL) title has been revealed. Jurgen Klopp’s men are in pole position to win their first Premier League title since the English top-flight league was rebranded as EPL in 1992. The UEFA Champions League and Super Cup winners are currently on top of the Premier League table with 22 points ahead of second place, Manchester City, after 25 games. According to the Daily Mail, a £4million bonus will be shared around Liverpool players, with a sliding scale used to know how much each player receives. Only the Reds players who have made the most first-team appearances this season will earn the most, receiving around £150,000 on top of the standard win bonuses they get during the campaign. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, is also expected to be handed a significant payout for managing the Anfield club to a first EPL title since 1990.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has slashed visa application charges for citizens of the United States from $180 to $160. NAN reports that this was contained in a memo marked NIS/HQ/CGI/806/7 and addressed to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The old amount comprised $160 as visa fee and $20 as “processing and expedient fees.” Comptroller-General of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Muhammad Babandede, said the reduction followed a review of the visa reciprocity fee slammed on Nigeria last August. The decision is one of the four taken against Africa’s most populous country in eight months. In the letter, the NIS urged all Nigerian missions in the U.S. to immediately implement the new visa charges payable by US citizens. “Our Missions are to issue up to two years multiple entry visa to frequent short visit travelers on request in line with reciprocity,” he said.

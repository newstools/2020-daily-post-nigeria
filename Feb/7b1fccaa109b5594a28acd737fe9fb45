Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has dropped a shocker for Local government Chairmen who intend to seek re-election. The tenure of the incumbent Chairmen of the 23 Local councils in the state will elapse in 2021. Speaking during a solidarity visit by the leaders and people of Oyigbo Local Government Area, Governor Wike said that there will be no automatic ticket for any Local Government Chairman for second term. He said that the emergence of any Local Government Chairman for second term will be on the strength of his performance and acceptance. Wike also advised all his political associates seeking the post of governor to seek the support of Rivers people, because he will not impose any Governor on the state. “Let me say it here, there will be no automatic ticket for any Local government Chairmen. All the aspirants must go to the field. If he wins he goes, if he loses he comes back. “I will not guarantee anybody’s return. I will not. “I am not going to impose anyone on Rivers State as their next Governor of Rivers State. Anyone who wants to be Governor of Rivers in 2023 should go and try. “All those hoping on me, I want to disappoint you. I am an experienced politician, I have seen it all. There is nobody that you will make a Governor that will remain loyal to you. “Nobody dashes power. You have to break the hand holding the power to collect it. Everyone is equal in this State. You need other people to be Governor. “The next Governor of Rivers State will not emerge on the basis of ethnic Nationality. The next Governor will be someone who can carry everyone along,” he said.

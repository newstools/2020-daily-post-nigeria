The Imo State House of Assembly has banned any form of protest in the state. The lawmakers said protests have become dangerous events and are exposing people of the state to danger. The lawmakers also issued a strong warning to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, asking the opposition party to stop crying wolf over the ruling of the Supreme Court that sacked Emeka Ihedioha as the governor. They further passed a vote of confidence in Uzodinma and the apex court.

The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Oyo State chapter, has called for the inclusion of its members in Amotekun. Yaqub Bello, a former Chairman of MACBAN in the state, spoke on Monday at a public hearing on the Oyo State Security Network Agency Bill, 2020, also known as Amotekun bill. Bello insisted that only haters of truth would oppose Amotekun. He noted that some of their members have been in Oyo State for over 40 years, cohabiting with the natives, married Yoruba women and have children. “So, our request is to include Myetti Allah as members of Operation Amotekun to enhance the job of the outfit, since we know the terrain of where we rear our cattle. “Having Fulani among the outfit will make it easier for Amotekun men to distinguish between genuine herdsmen and the criminals while on patrol. “A Fulani man can also serve as an interpreter while interrogating any suspected herdsman,” Bello said. He agreed that initiative was to curb criminal activities in the society and not to witch hunt any particular body or ethnic group. Bello added that MACBAN members have not been involved in any form of criminal activity.

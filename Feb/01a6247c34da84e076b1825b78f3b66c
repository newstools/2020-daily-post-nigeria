Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, on Friday, condoled with Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, over the death of his parents. Sani prayed God to give Kanu the fortitude to bear the loss of his parents. Kanu’s parent, HRH Eze Israel Kanu and his wife, Ugoeze Sally Kanu who died last year were laid to rest on Friday in their royal compound in Afaraukwu community, Abia State. DAILY POST, however, observed that the IPOB leader was absent during the burial ceremony. Kanu was last seen in Nigeria on September 10, 2017 after some soldiers invaded his residence in Afaraukwu community in Abia State. However, Sani in a tweet wrote: “Mr Nnamdi Kanu, my condolences. May the souls of your deceased parents rest in peace and may God give you the fortitude to bear the loss. Amen.”

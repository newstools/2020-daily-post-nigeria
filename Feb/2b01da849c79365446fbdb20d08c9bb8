Former Senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial district, Shehu Sani has reacted to the arrest of a suspected suicide bomber at Living Faith Church, a.k a Winners Chapel, in Kaduna. The Kaduna State Police Command, on Sunday, reported the arrest of a suspected suicide bomber inside a church located at Sabon Tasha in Chukun Local Government Area of the state. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Yakubu Sabo confirmed that the suspect, Nathaniel Samuel, a Christian from Bauchi State, was apprehended inside the church with a bag containing items suspected to be Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). Sani said the arrest of a Christian attempting to bomb a church shows the religious division among Nigerians. The former Kaduna lawmaker on his Twitter page said those happy that the alleged bomber is a Christian show tragedy in the country. According to Sani, this affirms the loss of brotherhood in the country. Sani wrote: ”There are those who are not happy that the alleged bomber ‘is not a Muslim’; there are those who are happy that the alleged bomber ‘is a Christian.’ ”We view our common tragedies via our religious lenses and prejudices and hence lost our common brotherhood and humanity.” Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC in a statement earlier said the arrest of a Christian suicide bomber is a mockery of the rally organized by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) yesterday. Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, alongside his members, led a protest against the insecurity situation across the country. The march against the constant killing of Christians in the North and other parts of the country had commenced from RCCG National Headquarters in Ebute Metta, Lagos State.

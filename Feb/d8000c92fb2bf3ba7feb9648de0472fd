Former Arsenal star, Paul Merson, has stated that Jose Mourinho is regretting taking the Tottenham’s job as their manager after the sack of Mauricio Pochettino. Mourinho replaced Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham in November, 12 hours after the Argentine was kicked out. Mourinho has won 10 with Spurs but losses to Chelsea and Manchester United have tampered expectations at the club. “I said when he went there it would give them a lift and there would be a charm offensive – and he was all smiles for a while,” Merson wrote for the Daily Star.
Merson noted further that everyone knew it (Mourinho’s success at the club) wouldn’t last. He said Mourinho has gone back to being Grumpy one again, adding he does not see how he ( Mourinho) improved them at all. Not one bit. “He looks like he’s thinking: ‘What have I done coming here?’ You don’t see him high-fiving ball boys now do you? He added. Tottenham sit fifth in the Premier League table and four points off Chelsea. Merson said that the Portuguese is only at the club to get them into the top four. “I can’t see Daniel Levy wanting to win the FA Cup but not get back into the Champions League.” Merson added that Chelsea are in the best position to finish fourth this season and he cannot see Jose Mourinho’s side catching them “I don’t think it will work for him there. That Southampton game was like an end-of-his-Old-Trafford-reign performance,” Merson said.

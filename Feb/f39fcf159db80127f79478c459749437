Following the setting up of a Reconciliatory Committee by the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Congress to reconcile aggrieved members in the party, an aggrieved member of the APC in Rivers State has listed out conditions in which peace can return to the party. The aggrieved member, Igo Aguma, said one of the conditions in which he would withdraw his suit against the party is for the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi to step aside as the leader of the party in Rivers State. Speaking in an interview with DAILY POST, Aguma said the move will enable the party conduct transparent congresses in the state, adding that he would be ready to meet with the Bisi Akande-led Reconciliation Committee where he would present the issues. Igo Aguma added that it was the ego of Rotimi Amaechi and Senator Magnus Abe that destroyed the fortunes of the APC. “I am not concerned about those that make-up the committee. It does not concern me. “What concerns me is that when they come to Port Harcourt I have my facts and I will lay them on the table. “I am comfortable with the leadership of the reconciliation committee and I am waiting for them to come to Port Harcourt as soon as possible. “When they come and address our concerns we will withdraw the matter in court. Our desires are simple and number one is that Rotimi Amaechi, my leader should step aside as the leader of the party so that we can move foward,” he said.

Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has named Wilfried Ndidi of Leicester City, as his favourite Nigerian footballer. Ferdinand revealed this while answering questions at the Guinness Night Football Pan African extravaganza tour in Lagos, Nigeria. Ndidi has made 109 Premier League appearances for the Foxes and scored six goals, since moving to the King Power Stadium in January 2017. On why he picked Ndidi, Ferdinand said: “I like Ndidi because he is fantastic, he works for everyone, he is not selfish, he is my favourite Nigerian footballer and I really admire him.” This comes days after Odion Ighalo signed a six-month deal with United. Ighalo becomes the first Nigerian to play for the Old Trafford side.

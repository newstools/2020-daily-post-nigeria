Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has admitted that he had doubts about Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, before he was appointed as Unai Emery’s successor. Aubameyang scored twice on Sunday, as the Gunners defeated Everton 3-2 at the Emirates. Speaking to Sky Sports after the match, Arteta revealed he was not sure about the Gabon striker’s work rate. He said: “Incredible, the amount of work that he is doing and how he takes on defensive responsibility. “Before I had my questions, but it shows the commitment that he’s showing with his teammates and with the club. “I wasn’t sure if he wanted to do it or if he could do it physically. But he showed that he can do it physically, so then it is about ‘Do you want to do it or not?”

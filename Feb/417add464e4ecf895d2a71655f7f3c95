The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has secured the convictions of three undergraduates. They are Cynthia Nwankwo Ifunanya (female), 22, Kingsley Omenazu, 27, and Okorie Kosalachi, 29. They were arraigned before Justice I Buba of the Federal High Court, Enugu, on two separate count charges of internet fraud. Justice Buba after reviewing the evidence against the convicts said prosecution counsel, Eunice Vou Dalyop, proved her case beyond reasonable doubt. He sentenced Alex to three years imprisonment, while Ifunanya and Omenazu were handed two years imprisonment respectively. They were, however, given N2 million option of fine each. Justice Buba further ruled that all the items recovered from the convicts by the EFCC should be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria. The convicts including the lady were arrested by the EFCC at Airport View Estate, Thinkers Corner, Enugu State following several calls by the residents on the increasing fraudulent activities of the convicts in the area. Four of the originally suspected fraudsters arraigned on separate two and three count charges, namely: Valentine Chinaza, Wisdom Obioma, Godswill Ndubuisi. O and Anya Precious Junior all pleaded not guilty as charged. In view of the pleas, Dalyop asked for a trial date and urged the court to remand them in Enugu Correctional Service. Justice Buba ordered the defendants to be remanded in correctional service pending the perfection of their bail conditions. He adjourned the matter till March 13, 2020 for trial.

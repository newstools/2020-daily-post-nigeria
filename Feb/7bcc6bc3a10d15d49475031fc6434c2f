China’s Foreign Ministry on Saturday condemned the U.S. government’s decision to restrict the entry of Chinese nationals due to the coronavirus outbreak. Coronavirus has been declared a global health emergency by the World Health Organization (WHO). “While the WHO has only just specifically advised against any travel restrictions, the U.S. has decided to act in the opposite way. “This has set a bad example. It is certainly not a gesture of goodwill,” ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said. The U.S. restrictions include a ban on the entry of foreign nationals – other than the immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents – who have travelled to China within the last 14 days. America also took the “unprecedented” step of placing 195 U.S. citizens who recently returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan in quarantine for 14 days. At the weekend, the number of people infected with the new coronavirus in China rose to more than 11,000, while a total of 259 people have died.

The General Overseer of Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, on Sunday explained that incessant killing in Nigeria was the reason for the church’s protest. Adeboye who was involved in a protest March on Sunday said victory will surely come at the end as the battle is of the Lord. Recall that the G.O alongside members of RCCG had embarked on the protest march from the church’s headquarters in Ebute Metta, Lagos State. Adeboye and his members had protested against the constant killing of Christians in the North and other parts of the country. However, in a series of posts on his verified Twitter handle, the clergyman while sharing photographs of the protest, wrote: “The protest was #NoToKillings #CANAgainstBloodshed “If Jesus is in you, you’ve the hope of glory, you’ve the hope of victory. #SongsOfVictory “It doesn’t matter how many forces against you, I assure you you’ve already won because the battle is not yours, the battle is the Lord’s.”

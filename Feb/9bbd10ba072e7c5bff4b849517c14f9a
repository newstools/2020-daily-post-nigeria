Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, on Monday declared that the man who attempted to bomb Living Faith Church in Kaduna was a Hausa Fulani Muslim and not a Christian. Fani-Kayode disclosed that the name of the attempted suicide bomber was Mohammed Nasiru Sani. Recall that the Kaduna State Police Command had on Sunday arrested a suspected suicide bomber inside a church located at Sabon Tasha in Chukun Local Government Area of the state. The state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Yakubu Sabo had confirmed that the suspect named Nathaniel Samuel was a Christian from Bauchi State. Sabo had said the suspect was arrested inside the church with a bag containing items suspected to be Improvised Explosive Devices (IED). Reacting to the arrest, Fani-Kayode faulted reports that the suspect was a Christian. In a series of tweets, the former Minister said anyone who believed claims that the suspect was a Christian should have his head examined. He recalled what a Kaduna-based Pastor Azzaman, wrote: “The Kaduna bomb planter Mohammed Sani confessed to being forced in detention to bear Nathaniel Tanko in custody. “He confirmed he is a Muslim & Fulani.He also claims an influential Muslim contracted him to bomb Living Faith Church Kaduna”. On his part, Fani-Kayode wrote: “If anyone really believes that the individual that attempted to plant a bomb in Winners Chapel, Kaduna is a Christian and that his real name is Nathaniel Tanko they need to have their heads examined. He is actually a Hausa Fulani Muslim and his real name is Mohammed Nasiru Sani.”

The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on Friday destroyed compounds housing Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists in Kaza, Ngala Local Government Area of Borno. Director, Public Relations and information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola in a statement on Friday in Abuja said the airstrike was executed on Feb. 5 following intelligence reports that some ISWAP members had relocated from nearby Tongule, NAN reports. He added that reports showed that some ISWAP elements had already set up camps in a cluster of compounds in Kaza, along with their logistics suppliers. “The identified location within the settlement was attacked by the ATF’s fighter jets after confirmatory Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions, showed significant presence of terrorists. “ This resulted in the destruction of the structures and the neutralization of some of the ISWAP fighters,” he said. Daramola assured that NAF and surface forces will promote air campaign to shape the battlespace in the North East for the effective conduct of further ground and air operations.

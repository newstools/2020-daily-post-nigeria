 The Magistrate, Mrs K.O. Doja-Ojo, gave the ruling on Monday. She sent the teenager to a Juvenile Centre for Boys in Oregun, following his plea of guilty to the charge preferred against him. The defendant is facing a one-count charge of stealing preferred against him by the police.   “At night, I went to the bulk room of the bank where I saw money; I took N340,000 and kept it in my pocket. “I had a lighter with me, when I was trying to exit the bank, the lighter attracted the security guards so I ran back to the toilet and locked myself up again,” Ayomikun said. The defendant added that when he eventually came out of the toilet, the security guards searched him and recovered the sum of N340,000 from him. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Peace Chukwudi, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Feb. 19, at 8:30p.m at FCMB Ajah branch. The case was adjourned the case until April 15 for mention.

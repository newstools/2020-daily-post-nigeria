Former Liverpool star, Michael Owen, has predicted some of tonight’s UEFA Europa League matches. Arsenal will take on Olympiakos in an away fixture after defeating Newcastle United 4-0 in the Premier League last weekend. Manchester United will face Club Brugge in Belgium following a 2-0 victory over Chelsea in their last encounter. Providing his prediction, Owen was quoted by Sport Review as saying thus; Club Brugge vs Man United: “A busy week for Manchester United, who picked up a win at Stamford Bridge before travelling to Belgium for the first leg of their Europa League tie. “Club Bruges are nine points clear in the Belgian First Division and did get a 2-2 draw in the Bernabeu against Real Madrid in the Champions League earlier in the season. “Club Bruges will provide a strong test for Man United on Thursday night. “The host have not won against a Premier League team in their last ten matches. “I feel the Red Devils will get a hard-earned draw against Club Brugge.” Olympiakos vs Arsenal: “Olympiakos drew against Tottenham at the beginning of the season in the Champions League group stages. “I see Arsenal playing a draw against the Greek Super League leaders tonight at the Karaiskakis Stadium.”

Former Barcelona midfield maestro, Xavi, is allegedly ‘extremely angry’ with the club’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, over his comments that he had never offered him the chance to become the Catalan manager at Camp Nou, according to Spanish outlet, El Larguero. DAILY POST had reported that Abidal has said that there was no offer for Xavi to become Barcelona manager. Abidal told Sport: “We had no offer for Xavi to become Barca coach. If he has one, let him display it because I have not seen it. “The first meeting we had with Xavi, he pays attention, and told us his plan in the second meeting. “The speculations in the media was more political than sporting and I do not do politics. I only discuss about football. “My interests is the way a coach works, and different things came up apart from what we conversed with Xavi. “Barca appointed Quique Setien for 2 years, and we believe in him alot. “However the door is at all times open for Xavi to become the club’s manager, but I don’t know if I will be at Camp Nou, but Blaugrana always has the door open for the ex-player.” Xavi is currently the head coach of Al-Sadd. He was widely expected to replace Ernesto Valverde last month before Barcelona opted to appoint Quique Setien as their new manager.

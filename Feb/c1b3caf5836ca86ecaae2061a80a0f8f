Former vice-president of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, has said religious affiliations should not be raised, when Boko Haram killings are discussed. Atiku stated this in reaction to President Muhammadu Buhari’s remarks, that 90% of Boko Haram victims are Muslims. Buhari, speaking on the death of the chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Michika, Adamawa, Lawan Andimi, claimed the insurgents are using religion to divide Nigerians. However, Atiku in a tweet on Wednesday, quoted a verse of the Qur’an (chapter 2 verse 256). “We mustn’t rationalise killings. Whether Christian, Muslim, Traditionalist, or Atheist, the killing of any human being, by Boko Haram, or any misguided group, is wrong & should be condemned unequivocally. There is no compulsion in religion. Only love,” he tweeted. DAILY POST reported that Andimi was beheaded by Boko Haram a few weeks ago.

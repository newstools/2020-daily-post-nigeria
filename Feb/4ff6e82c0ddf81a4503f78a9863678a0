The Chief of Staff to the Kaduna State Governor, Alhaji Sani Abdullahi on Tuesday represented his principal in the defense of the World Bank loan request, but was unable to support his defense with any documents. The situation forced Senator Obinna Ogba who is a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign and Local Debts to raise issues, stating that documents must be presented to reflect the loan. Members of the Committee, Senator Mohammed Oloreigbe stressed that the Committee cannot rely on the old documents which were submitted to the Committee in the 8th Senate, but was turned down. He said the supportive documents for the $350 million lapsed with the session, noting that “documents must be made available for the Committee to see before any further action.” Committee Chairman, Senator Clifford Ordia gave an ultimatum of 48 hours for the Chief of Staff to the Kaduna State Governor to avail documents to the Committee Secretariat. What further raised misgivings among the Committee members was the Chief of Staff’s inability to disclose the current debt profile of Kaduna, an issue that is germane to the approval of the loan by the Committee. Senator Uba Sani representing Kaduna Central, a member of the Committee however, urged the Lawmakers to approve the loan, saying that the state government was doing well in infrastructure. “Distinguished colleagues, I am seeking your cooperation for approval of the loan. Kaduna State government is doing well in infrastructure and this will go a long way. ” DAILY POST recalls that Senator Shehu Sani led Senate Committee on Foreign and Local Debts debts declined approval of the World Bank on grounds of debt.

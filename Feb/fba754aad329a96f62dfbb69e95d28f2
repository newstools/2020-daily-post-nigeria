Bayelsa Statw residents have reacted to Thursday’s Supreme Court’s judgment that sacked Governor-elect David Lyon and his running mate, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremioye both of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Justices-led by Justice Mary Odili held that Degi-Eremieoyo presented forged certificates to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Douye Diri of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is expected to be sworn in as winner. Solomon Oru, a civil servant, told NAN that the court’s decision was “not in the interest of Bayelsa people’’. “Lyon has not even started, before this sack, thus being denied the chance of hearing the cry of the civil servants. “The sudden judgment will affect the socio-economic development of the state,” he said. Theophilus Amabebe, a former Commissioner in Bayelsa, called for a review of the nation’s electoral law to avoid a situation where election certificates were issued and retrieved. “There should be a more organised system where a certificate once issued cannot be retrieved from the receiver. “Let us see what will happen tomorrow (Feb.14) and who will be sworn in as the real Governor of Bayelsa,” he said. Chuks Ekeonu, said sacking the Governor-elect was a serious matter that had to be looked at carefully before one could take side. “At first the people voted him to power; they would have nullified the election and called for rerun rather than the sack. “My take is that the right thing be done for the interest of the Bayelsa people who voted for David Lyon. “Now how will the PDP candidate see those that didn’t vote him to power,’’ he asked. Stella Ebiladei, a retired Principal, opined that the Supreme Court did the right thing sacking both. “The reason to me why both were sacked is because it was a joint ticket. “For me this will teach people not to be forging results, names and other important information about them,’’ she said.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said it will be “difficult” for the team to finish in the top four, despite beating Manchester City 2-0 on Sunday. The win put them four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea. But Mourino claims their involvement in three competitions – Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League – could yet count against them. “It is going to be difficult. We are in three competitions. But it was a good weekend for us,” he told reporters after the game. Mourinho also spoke about Oleksander Zinchenko’s red card that changed the complexion of the game. “I am so pleased for the boys. We were a bit lucky in a couple of situations, but the other perspective very, very unlucky the VAR did not decide for a Raheem Sterling red card. “It was a clear red card and a completely different game if we played for 75 minutes against 10 men. “I see other situations where the decision is red. The red card of Son Heung-min against Chelsea,” he added.

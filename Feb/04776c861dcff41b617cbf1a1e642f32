Suspect kidnappers, Friday night, stormed the residence of Prof. Abdullahi Mustapha, former Vice-Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria. The attackers abducted four persons and shot and killed an ABU hunter during the operation, PRNigeria reports. Those abducted at the ex-VCâ€™s house, located at Hayin Malam, in Zangon Shanu area of Zaria, include Maryam Abdullahi Mustapha (a staff of ABU), her two children and her elder sister. The kids were, however, rescued when a neighbour opened fire and killed one of the kidnappers as they fled. The elder sister was later released when the gunmen discovered she had asthma and took only Maryam away. Police spokesperson in Kaduna State, DSP Yakubu Sabo, has promised to provide an update after getting brief on the incident.

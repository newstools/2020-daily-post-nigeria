A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Femi Fani-Kayode, has given his thoughts as to why service chiefs sent their accountants to honour the summon by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila instead of coming themselves. In a viral video, the Speaker had expressed utter disappointment for the decision of the service chiefs to send their accountants for the meeting of the joint House Committees on ‎Defence, Army, Navy and Air Force with the Chief of Defence Staff, Chief of Army Staff, Chief of Naval Staff and the Chief of Air Staff. Fani-Kayode claimed that the service chiefs shunned Gbajabiamila’s invitation because they felt they are not accountable to a Southerner. He tweeted, “The Speaker of the House of Reps, a son of Oduduwa, summons the Service Chiefs (who are all, bar one, northern Muslims) for a crucial meeting. “The Service Chiefs refused to turn up and instead sent their accountants! The message is clear: we are not accountable to any Southerner!” In the meeting which was held on Wednesday, the Speaker told the service chiefs that the anxiety among Nigerians was enough reason for them to redouble their efforts in fighting banditry, kidnapping and insurgency in the country.

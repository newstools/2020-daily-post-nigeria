Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has described his side’s UEFA Champions League 2-1 defeat against Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday night as ‘complicated.’ The Brazilian international scored a goal for PSG at the Westfalenstadion Stadium. But Erling Haaland’s brace against PSG gave the host a first-leg advantage over the Ligue 1 champions. Reacting to the development, Neymar said as quoted by PSG’s official website: “It was a complicated game, it was tough on the pitch. “We tried to play our game, to create chances for ourselves, and we had more than them. “We cannot wait to play the second leg at home.” Neymar will now hope to lead PSG to victory when they take host Dortmund in the second leg on March 11.

Boxing promoter, Frank Warren, has told Deontay Wilder not to bother about fighting Tyson Fury again. Fury won the world title for the second time, with a seventh-round stoppage of Wilder on Sunday morning. Wilder had previously never lost in his career. Their first bout ended in a draw. Wilder has the contractual right to demand a third fight, but Warren now wants to see Fury take on fellow Brit Anthony Joshua, in a world heavyweight title unification fight. “The stumbling block is that he [Joshua] has to fight Pulev. If I was him I wouldn’t fight Pulev, I would even vacate the belts to get the fight with Tyson on. “He should not take the risk. I’d prefer him not to take the risk, I’d prefer Wilder not to take the rematch and let’s get it on,” Warren said according to the Daily Mail.

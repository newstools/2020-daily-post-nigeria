Barcelona have announced that forward, Ousmane Dembele will undergo surgery on February 11 in Finland. Dembele picked up a right hamstring injury during their UEFA Champions League 3-1 win over Dortmund last year. Barcelona made this known in a statement on their club’s official website on Thursday. “Ousmane Dembélé will undergo surgery on February 11 (Tuesday) in Turku, Finland, to treat a rupture to the proximal tendon of his right hamstring,” a club statement read. “Further information will be given regarding his approximate recovery time once the operation has been concluded.” Dembele will miss Barcelona’s clash with Athletic Club in the Copa del Rey on tonight. He will also miss their LaLiga away fixture against Real Betis next Sunday.

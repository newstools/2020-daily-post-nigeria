Berta Gomez, the mother of Paris Saint-Germain striker, Edinson Cavani, has demanded an apology from Atletico Madrid, before they can sign her son in the summer. Cavani was keen on a move to the LaLiga side in January, but a switch never materialized, after his brother and agent Walter Fernando allegedly wanted Atletico to pay an additional £15m. The 32-year-old will be a free agent in June, when his current PSG contract runs out. Atletico president, Enrique Cerezo, speaking on the failed transfer, said: “I don’t want to point anyone out, but I think it’s a shame about the situation of some players with their relatives and their representatives. “It’s outrageous. We’re not here to be robbed or do anything strange.” Gomez, in an interview with AS, however demanded Cerezo retracts his comments, if he wants to sign Cavani. “It’s not impossible that Edinson could go to Atletico Madrid in the summer, as long as the president rectifies what he said. “The president of Atletico must apologise. We are not spiteful and everything can be fixed if he retracts what he said. My son is going to have offers, it is unquestionable because he is a proven forward, as he has shown in all these years. “But he keeps thinking about being able to go to Atletico because he would like to play under Cholo (Simeone),” she said.

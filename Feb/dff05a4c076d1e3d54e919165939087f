Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has predicted that Frank Lampard will replicate the tactical system he used, when Chelsea beat them 2-0 in December. Willian scored twice in the first half that day, as Lampard got one over Mourinho. Chelsea’s form has since dropped and they go into Saturday’s encounter, only one point ahead of Spurs. Mourinho believes Lampard will set up with a five-man defence, which worked so effectively two months ago. “They’ll play three at the back like in December,” Mourinho replied reporters on Friday, when asked how he thinks Lampard will set up. Lampard however refused to give anything way about his game plan. “It was pleasing on the day. And the way the players implement it. This is the best league in the world. You always try to prepare. Every game is different. “It’s a different game to the one we took on at Tottenham. It doesn’t mean that we can just play the same way,” he said.

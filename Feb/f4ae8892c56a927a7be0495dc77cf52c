Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has said the club is aiming to finish strongly in the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League this season. United are 5th in the Premier League, and on 38 points behind table-topping rivals Liverpool. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men also played a 1-1 draw with Club Brugge in the first leg of their last-32 clash last week. The Red Devils face Derby County in the fifth round of the FA Cup next month. “We are pushing for a strong finish in the Premier League, the Europa League and the FA Cup as we enter the final third of the season,” Woodward said according to Sky Sports. Woodward also made it clear that Solskjaer will be at Old Trafford for the long term. “We have continued to make progress on our squad rebuild, with many changes in terms of players that we have brought in and players that have come through our academy; the foundation for delivering the long-term success that we are all working towards is in place as we implement our plan and our footballing vision with Ole.

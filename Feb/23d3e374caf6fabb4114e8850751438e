Maverick entertainer, Charles Oputa, popularly known as Charlyboy has supported the ban on Okada and keke Napep by the Lagos State government. Charlyboy said he was in support of the ban owing to insights and details he got from Hausa Chairman in the State. The maverick entertainer disclosed that the Okada riders were coming into Lagos with hidden motives. On his Twitter page, he wrote: “People called and asked me why I allowed Lagos state government to ban Keke/Okada riders for most major roads in Lagos. ”The Okada riders I dey see now no be my boys, most of them no know me and me no know them. ”I fully support this Okada ban based on my discussion with one of my Hausa chairmen. He gave me more insights into the activites of these Okada riders. ”This man told me that the Okada riders are coming to Lagos enmass and gathering momentum to enable them do the kind of things they practice in Kaduna, Kano . Charlyboy further warned Nigerians to be vigilant. “I was told that their new concentration bases are, Lagos and Kwara for now. “My People, we must be vigilant oooo. Wahala dey,” he added. Recall that the ban, which took effect from Saturday, February 1, resulted in some Lagos residents getting stranded at bus stops. But, the Lagos state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday reiterated that the ban has come to stay permanently in the state.

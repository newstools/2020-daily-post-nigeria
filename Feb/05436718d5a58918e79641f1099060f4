Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has decided to stay at the club beyond this season, Sky Sports reports. Messi was involved in a public bust-up with sporting director, Eric Abidal, this week. Abidal claimed that some players did not work hard enough under former manager, Ernesto Valverde, who was replaced last month by Quique Setien. Messi fired back in an Instagram post, telling the former France defender, to face his work. The clash led to speculation that the Argentine superstar might leave Camp Nou this summer, especially since Abidal was told his job is safe. Messi has a clause in his current, which allows him to leave for free at the end of the season and he has been linked with a possible reunion with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. However, he will stay until 2021 when his current contract expires and is open to extending it.

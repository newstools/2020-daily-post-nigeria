The All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), in Abia State, has frowned at the existence of Transition Committee Chairmen in the state. The party stated that the frequent constitution of transition chairmen for the seventeen local government areas in the state by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, served as conduit pipe in which public funds are being stolen by the successive and present Abia government thereby the masses will be subjected to untold hardship and misery. APGA, in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary in Abia state, Felix Nkoro and made available to reporters in Umuahia, the state capital on Friday, called on the Ikpeazu-led government to conduct local government election within three months. It also added, “That party would not jump into issues without proper verification and convinced by anti-graft agency in respect to the recent looting allegation on the former governor of Abia state, Chief Theodore Orji and his son and current speaker of the Abia House of Assembly, Chinedum Orji. The allegations have proven public outcry and vindicated APGA against PDP maladministration in the state. “We are no longer comfortable with the current condition of the pensioners, as well as teachers who do not receive their pay as at when due and called on the financial crime agency to nose more on the management of the state resources”. However, a socio-political organization, Unity forum backed by a former governor of Abia state, Senator Theodore Orji, in reaction in a press statement signed by its president, Paul Enyioma Okpanku, secretary, Barrister Chimereze, described the publication as false and baseless.

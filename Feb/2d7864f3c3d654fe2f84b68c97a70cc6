Ajax winger, Hakim Ziyech, has said he has “unfinished business” with the Dutch club, after his move to Chelsea was confirmed on Thursday. Ziyech will move to Stamford Bridge after this season for a fee of €44million. The 26-year-old has been struggling with a calf problem for the past three weeks and made a return in their 3-0 win over Vitesse last night. After his exit was confirmed, Ziyech took to his Instagram page to express his joy at agreeing to sign for the Blues. “Happy to be fit again so I can enjoy these last months on the pitch, where I belong. “Received a lot of warm and positive messages during my absence and I hope to create just a few more beautiful memories than we already have. “Very happy with my next step, but first I have some unfinished business to handle.”

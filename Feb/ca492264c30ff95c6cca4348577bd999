The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday declared that President Muhammadu Buhari is oblivious of the serious issues going on in Nigeria. National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus said this at an emergency meeting of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting of the party in Abuja. Secondus stated that Nigeria was at a cross road due to the “obvious inept leadership of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC.”. He noted that the security situation in the country hes refused to abate and that nothing concrete was being done by the government to stop the senseless killing of innocent Nigerians. “Even when the National Assembly after reviewing the situation and asked the President to overhaul the security system for greater efficiency, the government has continued to demonstrate their insensitivity to the plight of the populace. Nigerians have never been as afraid of their lives as they are at the moment in this country. “In the North East the Boko Haram insurgency has returned fully and the President feels shocked that the sect still exists. We are already used to our President not knowing what is going on in the country even though as President the bulk stops on his table. “The President may have been deceived by the intelligence reports from his field men who continues to indulge in propaganda of claiming that the sect has been defeated even when the situation is worsening with banditry and kidnapping spreading all over the states. “Nothing exposes the President’s insensitivity and distance from reality and from the people like his shock that Boko haram still exists. But what do we expect when the President’s chief security adviser are in loggerhead with the President’s number one aide, your guess is as good as mine on why this administration cannot move this nation forward.”

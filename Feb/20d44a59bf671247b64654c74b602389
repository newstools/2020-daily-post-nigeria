Eric Abidal, the Sporting Director at Barcelona, has revealed that Lionel Messi wants to remain at the club. Messi was recently involved in a public bust-up with Abidal. This is after the Frenchman accused some Barca players of not working hard enough under sacked manager, Ernesto Valverde, who was replaced last month by Quique Setien. Messi had fired back in an Instagram post, telling the former France international to face his work. The clash led to speculation that the Argentine superstar might leave Camp Nou this summer, especially since Abidal was told his job is safe. Messi could decide to end his career in another club after seeing out the final 12 months of his current contract. Abidal told reporters that he hopes the Argentine skipper will sign a new deal soon despite the bust-up. “The question is for him, hopefully it continues,” said the Frenchman. “Leo said that Barca is everything for him, that he wants to stay here, from there are conditions. “We are talking about the best player in the world and having a renewal with such a player is never easy.”

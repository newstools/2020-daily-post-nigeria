The Nigerian Air Force has dissociated the ‘Breaking News’ which claimed NAF killed over 250 Boko Haram fighters in Maiduguri, the Borno capital. The rebuttal was contained in a statement on Sunday by Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, the NAF Director of Public Relations. Daramola said the fake news said to have been released on February 13 by one ‘Comr Aminu Shuaibu Musawa’ did not originate from the NAF. He stated that “the false sensational news item, with its gory doctored visuals, is totally fake and did not originate from the NAF. “Media houses and indeed the general public are please reminded that authentic information on the activities of the NAF will always be released officially by the Director of Public Relations and Information (DOPRI),” he said. Daramola stated that authentic information on the activities of the Service would always be released on the NAF website, www.airforce.mil.ng, as well as NAF official social media handles. He gave the NAF official social media handles as: Twitter – @NigAirForce; Facebook – Nigerian Air Force HQ (@hqnigerianairforce); Instagram – Nigerian Air Force, and YouTube – Nigerian Air Force. “Any reports emanating from other sources without verification from the NAF should be completely discountenanced,” the spokesman said. Daramola further vowed that originator(s) of the information would be arrested and prosecuted.

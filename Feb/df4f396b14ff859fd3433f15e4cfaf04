A gynecologist, Cherechi Okonko attached to the Federal Medical Centre Owerri in Imo state is said to have been admitted at the hospital as a result of his wife’s severe cuts which chopped off both his tongue and nose, affecting part of his lower jaw. DAILY POST reports that the incident occurred on Thursday at the doctor’s residence in the World Bank area of Owerri, Imo state. According to a staff of FMC who did not want his name in print, “the victim is our doctor here, and he was bleeding all over his body when they brought him here last night.” “He was stabilized, although he could not talk up till now. It was horrible.” Our reporter who tried in vain to know what actually led to the incident, noted further that the weird wife after allegedly cutting off her husband’s parts, called her mother-in-law on the phone to come and carry his son’s corpse. Orlando Ikeokwu, the Imo Police Public Relation Officer stated that, although it was a family issue, the command has waded into it with a view to finding out the truth. Meanwhile, Cherechi’s incident has made it the fourth consecutive cases of domestic violence in the state out of which one death was recorded.

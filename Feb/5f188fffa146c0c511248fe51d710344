Tottenham Hotspur has confirmed that their manager, Jose Mourinho, will be without four key players when they take on Chelsea in the Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge on Saturday due to injuries. Tottenham made this known in a statement on its official website on Friday. Mourinho’s side head to the game following a 1-0 defeat to RB Leipzig in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday. “Four players remain sidelined as we build-up to Saturday lunchtime’s clash with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge,” a club statement read. “There’s encouraging news on midfielder Moussa Sissoko, though, who has commenced on-field rehabilitation after undergoing knee surgery recently. “Defender Juan Foyth, meanwhile, is in the late stages of conditioning following a groin injury. “Moussa and Juan remain out, alongside Harry Kane, who is continuing rehabilitation from his hamstring injury, and Heung-Min Son, who is recovering following arm surgery.” Kick-off for the match is 1:30 pm, Nigerian time.

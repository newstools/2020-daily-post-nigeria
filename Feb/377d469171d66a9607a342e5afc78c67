A housewife, Asia, on Thursday told an Area Court in Ilorin that she has had enough of her husband’s hardship and wants divorce. The duo formalised their marriage eight months ago But the man, Musa Abdulkareem, prayed against the petition, saying that he still loves her. “My Lord, I am not ready for any divorce because I still love my wife. Help me beg her and settle the matter,” NAN quoted him as saying. The mother of two children had approached the court to dissolve the marriage over Abdulkareem’s inability to care for the family. Asia explained that she had been providing for the family including the two kids they had outside wedlock. “The man I call husband cannot pay his children’s school fees; provide food for the family, not to talk of paying house rent. “What is his usefulness if he cannot cater for his family? I have been the one struggling to meet the demands of my children Amudalat 6 and Aminat 2. “My Lord, I urgently want an end to this marriage because I cannot endure this hardship anymore. Dissolve this marriage for my children’s sake,” she said. Asia requested custody of their two children and an order of court compelling Abdulkareem to pay N10,000 monthly as feeding allowances for the children. The Presiding Judge, Mr Abdulhameed Aliyu, adjourned the case until April 8 for continuation.

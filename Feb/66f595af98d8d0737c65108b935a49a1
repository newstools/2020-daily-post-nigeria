Victor Moses has said he is settling well at Inter Milan, especially with the presence of Romelu Lukaku, Christian Eriksen and Ashley Young, who he already knows from the Premier League. Lukaku moved to Inter from Manchester United last summer, while Moses joined in the January window along with Eriksen and Young. Moses started for Antonio Conte’s men on Sunday, as they beat Udinese 2-0 at the Dacia Arena. Speaking after Sunday night’s clash, the former Nigeria international told Inter TV: “I’m settling in very well because I know a few lads as well – Ashley Young, Lukaku and Eriksen that came in as well. “It’s like a family in the changing room and all the lads are cracking jokes which is very good. “We are all settling in well and we are enjoying every moment but the most important thing when it is time for the game we have to switch on and make sure we win every game. “To be a champion you have to work very hard and then we have to put that in now right from today to the end of the season.”

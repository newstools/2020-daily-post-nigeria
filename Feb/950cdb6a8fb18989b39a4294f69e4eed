Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has been playing through the pain barrier, according to ESPN. Messi is believed to be struggling with a thigh problem, but cannot take time off, as the team is short in attack. The Argentina superstar has continued to be his usual decisive self inspite of the injury and he set up both goals in Barca’s 2-1 win against Levante. However, new manager Quique Setien’s training methods, is having a negative effect on Messi. “The sessions are different and some of the drills are more intense. “Some players seem to be feeling the fatigue a bit more and that’s when the pain can appear,” a source said. Luis Suarez is out until May and Ousmane Dembele limped out of training this week with a hamstring issue. Setien has just three fit forwards: Messi, Antoine Griezmann and Ansu Fati.

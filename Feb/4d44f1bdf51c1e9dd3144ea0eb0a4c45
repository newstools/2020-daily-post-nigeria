The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole has condemned the Supreme Court’s judgment which sacked David Lyon, APC Governor-elect. In a unanimous judgement on Thursday, Justice Mary Odilli annulled the party’s victory in Bayelsa State. A five man panel held that Lyon’s deputy, Degi-Eremieoyo presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). But, Oshiomhole speaking at a media briefing in Abuja, on Thursday, said the party will challenge the judgment in court. He said no one will be sworn in as governor in Bayelsa on Friday because David Lyon is the only candidate who has the constitutional spread to be sworn in as governor. “No other candidate has the constitutional spread to be sworn in as governor; the judgement lacks fruit of justice. “Our lawyers are already studying the judgment to take the necessary legal action,” Oshiomhole said.

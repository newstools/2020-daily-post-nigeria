Leicester City head coach, Brendan Rodgers, has insisted Wilfred Ndidi was not rushed back from injury. Ndidi suffered a knee problem in January and had surgery, which was expected to rule him out of action until the end of February. The Super Eagles midfielder however returned to action 13 days after his operation and played against Aston Villa and West Ham. Ndidi has not featured in Leicester’s last two games and has now been ruled out of the clash against Manchester City on Saturday, as he is still struggling with the problem. “Medically, he passed the tests and measures to show he was okay. “He had played a game and a half. He came on here after half an hour against West Ham and came through that. Then he played in the other game [vs Villa]. “From a manager’s perspective, you’re guided by medics and himself. He just didn’t quite get the right feeling going into the Chelsea game,” Rodgers told Leicester Mercury.

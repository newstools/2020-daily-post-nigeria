The Zamfara State government said it has discovered two buildings in Kaura-Namoda and Sakajiki, suspected to be used as hideouts by cattle rustlers in the state. This was disclosed to newsmen in Gusau, the state capital by Hon. Abubakar Dauran, the State Commissioner for Security and Home Affairs, shortly after he inspected the buildings on Wednesday. “We have discovered today in Kaura Namoda and Sakaji the houses being used by rustlers as hideouts for stolen cows. Dauran noted that the house in Kaura-Namoda belongs to one Abdurrahman Isah alias Zabo while the one in Sakajiki belongs to one Abdurrahman Loko. The commissioner explained that some stolen cows from Zurmi Local Government Area of the state had been traced to the two buildings. “In spite of efforts by the state government to tackle security challenges in the state, some bad elements had continued to involve themselves in dirty business,” he lamented. He said that his ministry would seek permission from the state government to demolish the houses, stressing that they have arrested the owner of the house in Kaura Namoda, but the one in Sakajiki is still at large. “We must ensure that he is arrested and handed over to security agencies for investigation and prosecution, ” he said. The Commissioner, however, warned informants to criminals to desist from such act, saying that anyone caught would be arrested and brought to book. Dauran vowed that nobody would be a sacred cow or untouchable, saying that justice must prevail at all cost.

Former Super Eagles Captain, John Mikel Obi, has been the subject of racial abuse, as his Turkish club Trabzonspor beat Fenerbahce last weekend. Mikel Obi was targeted on social media following the game, which moved Trabzonspor into third position above their opponents. Reports in Turkey claimed abusive messages were sent to the player’s Instagram page, which included the use of the N-word and banana emojis. The club have confirmed they have filed criminal complaints” against the offenders. A statement posted on Twitter reads: “Racism is a shelter for [the] helpless and ignorant.” Mikel Obi has remained silent after the incident, but his team-mate, Joao Pereira, said it was “sad and unacceptable”. “Football is much bigger than the little people behind these unfortunate acts,” he tweeted.

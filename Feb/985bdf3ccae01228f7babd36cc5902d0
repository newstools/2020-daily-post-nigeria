The All Progressives Congress, APC, on Monday expressed sadness over the death of Plateau South Senatorial District, Senator Ignatius Longjan. Longjan, who died on Sunday evening in Abuja was the Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Culture and Tourism and a former Deputy Governor of Plateau State. Reacting to his death, the ruling party described Longjan as a grassroots politician and progressive federal lawmaker who advocated for a smooth working relationship between the executive and legislature as a way of ensuring good governance and proper initiation and implementation of policies that impact positively on the people. A statement by the APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu said the late lawmaker was a loyal party man who, “championed party supremacy over personal interest in all party matters and decisions, as displayed in the emergence of the leadership of the current 9th National Assembly.” “We extend our condolences to Senator Longjan’s immediate family, constituents, the National Assembly, the government and entire people of Plateau State. May the Almighty God grant all comfort during this time of grief and may the soul of Senator Longjan rest in peace,” he added.

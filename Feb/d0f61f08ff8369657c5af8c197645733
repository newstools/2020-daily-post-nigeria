The Buhari Media Organization, (BMO) says the conviction of the former National Publicity Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Olisa Metuh for receiving about N400Million from the Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA), is another proof that the anti corruption war of the Buhari administration is on course. The organisation added that this latest conviction should sound a note of warning to public office holders to be mindful of the sacred trust they owe the people when they occupy public office, and always utilize public funds according to the laws of the land. In a statement signed by its Chairman Niyi Akinsiju and Secretary Cassidy Madueke, BMO said it believes that the conviction of Olisa Metuh will serve as a lesson to other people who may wish to tamper with public funds in future. “Again, with the delivery of a guilty verdict on Metuh, the Nigerian judiciary has demonstrated its impartiality and that any person who violates the law, no matter how highly placed, will have his or her day in court. We believe that occupying government office is a rare opportunity to serve the people and not to take advantage of the system. “We advise that those politicians who want to use public office to enrich themselves should have a rethink as there is a new Sherriff in town. Definitely, the Buhari administration is resolute in curbing corruption in our public life and the least that is expected of Nigerians, especially politicians, is to lend their support.” According to the BMO, all the monies recovered from looters will be channelled into developing the country’s dilapidated infrastructure. “While we do not gloat over the fate that has befallen Olisa Metuh and his co-travellers, yet it must be noted that due process was followed in his conviction and any country worth it’s salt must always adhere to the rule of law,” the statement added.

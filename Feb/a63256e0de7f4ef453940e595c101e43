Elder statesman, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, has disclosed that retired generals would be placed in charge of the proposed Southeast regional security outfit. Iwuanyanwu said that former warlords and retired security officers may oversee the security operation. The elder statesman was part of the Ohanaeze Ndigbo caucus meeting, “Ime obi” held on regional security in Enugu State last week. He disclosed that the President-General of Ohanaeze, Nnia Nwodo, was given the mandate to set up a strategy committee to include experienced people in security and warfare, including “retired security officers and professors.” Iwuanyanwu further hinted that the committee will work in tandem with the elders’ council to ensure efficient security for the zone. He said that governors of the South-East are crucial in the setting up of the security operation.

The leadership of Justice and Freedom Party (FJP) has described the deregistration of 74 political parties in Nigeria including FJP by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as sabotage and prejudicial. In a statement by the National Chairman of the Party, Dr. Onwubuya Abraham, which was made available to DAILY POST on Saturday, the party maintained that the electoral umpire was up to something surreptitious given the fact that the FJP was in court over critical issues that bother on the credibility of the nation’s democracy. The statement faulted the way and manner the Independent National Electoral Commission liquidated the 74 political parties, saying that “it contravenes the Electoral Act which gave a lifeline to existing political parties in Nigeria.” FJP party leadership wondered how the electoral umpire would wound up political parties that have legal cases against it. The party argued that the registration of Freedom and Justice Party gave it a legal entity to sue and be sued, extrapolating that “If liquidated, what would be the fate of cases against the INEC in court?” “Freedom and Justice Party (FJP) is currently in Supreme Court with INEC, all the way from High Court to Appeal Court. “Now at Supreme Court, the Commission has been served by our Lawyers and theirs have responded, and we are now waiting for the date of hearing. “So INEC knew they will lose at the Supreme Court, hence, they are trying to abuse the court process. “For public notice, FJP can not be said to be deregistered on social media or pages of newspapers as we have not received any formal notice from INEC. “FJP wants to appeal to all and sundry to be calm but we must move quickly to ensure that the law of our land prevails. The party added that it will approach the Court for an appropriate remedy, if the Independent National Electoral Commission insists on its deregistration, disclosing that its legal Counsels were already studying the situation.

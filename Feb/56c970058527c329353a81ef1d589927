The National Examinations Council (NECO) has published the results of candidates, who sat for their November/December 2019 Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE) for external candidates. This was announced by Mohammed Gana, the Acting Registrar of the Council on Thursday. In a statement, Gana stated that the results are available 49 days after the last paper was written. A total of 65,207 candidates sat for English language, out of which 41,214, representing 63% got either Distinction or Credit. 66,398 candidates sat for Mathematics, out of which 54,565, representing 82.18% got either Distinction or Credit. Gana said that 33,576 candidates, representing 48.68% got five credits and above, including English Language and Mathematics. The NECO boss, however, expressed his displeasure at the increase in exam malpractices. “While 12,084 cases were recorded in 2018, 17,004 cases was recorded in 2019. “This came about as a result of the comprehensive monitoring by senior staff which also resulted in the decline in number of candidates with 5 credits and above,” Gana said.

Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard has provided his team’s injury update ahead of their Premier League clash with Manchester United to Stamford Bridge on Monday night. The game between the two Premier League rivals could go a long way in determining who finishes fourth in the English topflight. Lampard told Chelsea official website on Saturday that star forward Christian Pulisic has been training with the U23s as he continues to recover from a hip injury. Pulisic, will, however, not be available for selection against United on Monday. England international Ruben Loftus-Cheek has also been working hard after recovering from a serious Achilles injury but the midfielder will not participate in the game. The manager also confirmed that striker Tammy Abraham is still feeling the effects of an ankle injury that he initially suffered against Arsenal last month. He said the young striker will need to be assessed over the weekend before his availability for the match will be determined. “Christian trained with the Under-23s today, which will hopefully be for a short period and we’ll factor him back into our training soon but he won’t be fit [for United],” he told Chelsea.com “Ruben won’t be fit for this game. He’s getting closer, training a lot and he just needs more match fitness to be in consideration but it’s great to have him nearly back. “Tammy is still feeling the effects, we’ve had to take him out of training for a couple of days this week. He trained today so we’re hopeful but he’ll be assessed over the weekend.” A win will see Chelsea maintain their fourth place and brighten their hope of playing in the Champions League next season.

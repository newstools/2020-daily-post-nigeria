The Supreme Court on Thursday sacked the governor-elect of Bayelsa State, David Lyon of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Also affected is his Deputy, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremieoyo. The panel of justices led by Justice Mary Odili, in a unanimous judgement, held that Degi-Eremieoyo presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). It ruled that the information in Form CF 001 submitted by Degi-Eremieoyo was false. The lead judgement read by Justice Ejembi Eko upheld the November 12, 2019, Judgement of the Federal High Court in Abuja that disqualified Degi-Eremieoyo from participating in the governorship poll. The apex court held that since Degi-Eremieoyo shared a joint ticket with the governor-elect, his disqualification invalidated their nomination by the APC. The apex court ordered INEC to issue fresh certificates to the next party with the next highest votes. The caveat is that the candidate to be sworn in must have 25 percent lawful votes in 2/3 of the 8 local government areas in Bayelsa. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Douye Diri, is expected to be the beneficiary of the judgement as results of the election show below.

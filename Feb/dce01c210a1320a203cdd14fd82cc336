A Chinese national has contracted coronavirus within 15 seconds of standing next to an infected woman. Daily Mail reports that the 56-year-old man had been standing close to 61-year-old woman, carrier of the infection. The man from the city of Ningbo, stood inside a booth with the infected woman. Officials say the man later visited two supermarkets and a restaurant before he was diagnosed. Jiangbei Health Commission confirmed neither patient wore a face mask at the time of contact.

Odion Ighalo has revealed that he took a pay cut to ensure his move to Manchester United happened. The Nigerian striker will play for the Red Devils until the end of the season, after agreeing a six-month loan. It is a dream come true for Ighalo, who supported United as a child growing up in Ajegunle, Lagos and he was not ready to allow money stand in the way. “(My agent) said you’re going to get a pay-cut to go to United. I said I don’t care. Make this deal happen. I want to go to United. I don’t care how much the pay-cut,” Ighalo told the club’s official website. The 30-year-old also promised to give his best for the Premier League side. “I’m happy to be a Man United player, I’m looking forward to the game and I promise to give my best from the first day I put on the jersey to the last day of my time here. “I promise to add my own path to make sure the season finishes well for United,” Ighalo added.

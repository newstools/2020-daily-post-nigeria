Aston Villa captain, Jack Grealish, has decided on a move to Manchester United this summer. The 24-year-old has already agreed terms with the Red Devils, although formal talks are yet to take place between both clubs. Grealish is widely expected to leave Villa Park this summer, with his boyhood club fighting to avoid relegation. It is believed the player has even started looking for houses in Manchester, after verbally agreeing to a deal that will see him earn more than his current £100,000 per week. Grealish has contributed seven goals and five assists so far this season. United have jumped to the front of the queue for Grealish, with Paul Pogba’s future still up in the air. The club will do business if they are offered £150 million for Pogba and use the funds to bring in Grealish.

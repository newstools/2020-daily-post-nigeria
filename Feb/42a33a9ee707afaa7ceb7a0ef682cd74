Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, almost left the club on transfer deadline day, the UK Mirror reports. The German had an offer from a Qatari club, but the deal fell through with the Gunners blocking his exit. Although Ozil was ready to consider leaving the Emirates, Arsenal felt the timing was too short. It is also understood that manager Mikel Arteta, was willing to let the 31-year-old go, especially as the suitor was going to foot his huge salary. But the timing of the proposed switch left the Gunners with little time to source any source of replacement. Ozil, who was frozen out under Unai Emery, has started every game under Arteta. The former Real Madrid man appears to be enjoying his football again, with Arteta allowing him to play in his favourite role, roaming behind the attackers.

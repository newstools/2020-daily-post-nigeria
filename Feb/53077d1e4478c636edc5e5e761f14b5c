Abdullahi Shinkafi, Acting Executive Chairman, Federal Character Commission, says the FCC will ensure fairness and equity in recruitment into Federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs). NAN reports that Shinkafi spoke on Monday in Abuja at a sensitisation programme organised by FCC Public Affairs Department. He said: “We have a big job; the whole nation is looking up to us to unite them together and that is what the FCC Anthem is about. “I want to assure PAC of our maximum support; if funds are available, we will do the needful to support you to carry out your work smoothly; protection of national interest is a priority. “Some negative things have been written about FCC which are not true. It is the duty of PAC to ensure that the interest of the Commission and country are protected”. Dipo Akinshola, Director of PAC, stressed the need to sensitise the public on FCC activities as well as the commission’s readiness work towards the unity and progress of Nigerians.

Chelsea has been given a major boost ahead of their Premier League clash with Manchester United on Monday night at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea confirmed in a post on their official website that midfielder, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, returned to the Blues’ training at Cobham on Tuesday morning following his recent recovery from injury. Loftus-Cheek trained with Chelsea’s first-team players that includes the likes of N’Golo Kante, Antonio Rudiger, and Mateo Kovačić. The England international is hoping to regain full match fitness to be part of the Chelsea squad that will tackle Man United. The 24-year-old has not featured for Frank Lampard’s side since he ruptured his Achilles during their friendly against the New England Revolution last May. Chelsea head to the clash following a 2-2 draw against Leicester City in their last Premier League encounter.

Manchester United midfielder, Nemanja Matic, has expressed confidence that his side will displace Chelsea from the fourth spot on the Premier League table this season. Matic, a former Chelsea player, said this following the Red Devils’ Premier League 2-0 win over Frank Lampard’s side on Monday at Stamford Bridge. Speaking after the encounter, the Serbian international told MUTV: “A massive win for us. “I am so confident Man United can now displace Chelsea from the fourth spot on the EPL table after our victory at Stamford Bridge. “We are now in the race for the Premier League top four. “I think Lampard’s men will still drop points going forward and we have to take advantage of that.” “Stamford Bridge is a difficult place to get a result, but we managed to win there despite the pressure I pray we continue with this form.”

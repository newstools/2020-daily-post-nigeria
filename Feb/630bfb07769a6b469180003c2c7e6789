Zamfara State Government has said its decision to expand some roads in Gusau the state capital is meant to modernise the metropolis contrary to speculations by political enemies in the state. Matawalle made the clarification in Gusau when he received the state’s Council of Ulama who visited to plead with him to stop the ongoing expansion of some roads in the metropolis. The governor said, “my resolve to upgrade roads in the state, especially the state capital Gusau, is to make it more urban that will fit into committee of state capitals of the federation and boast of having all it takes to be a major city.” “My administration intends to have a modern government House, an airport, hotels as well, as industries and sustainable power source that would be attractive to all our local and foreign investors already indicating interest to invest in the state. “It is sad that some people are misrepresenting these good intentions and using politics against us, even going to the extent of petitioning the President, but we will do our best to prove them wrong,” he assured. Matawalle commended the ulamas for their concern towards a sustainable peaceful coexistence, and urged them not to relent in giving him good advice for the promotion of the wellbeing of the state and its citizens. Earlier, Chairman of the council, Sheik Abubakar Fari noted that the council of ulama as an impartial arbiter, decided to wade into the matter. He urged the Governor to consider altering the road plan on the streets in question because he is the father of all and should listen to his subjects in matters that will not compromise fundamental aspects of governance. The chairman commended the Governor for listening to them and prayed for the continued unity of the state.

A power plant belonging to the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TRC) located at Ring Road in Ibadan, the Oyo state capital is currently on fire. The fire incident has attracted the attention of security agents, firefighters and other residents who are trying to reduce the damages. The cause of the fire and the extent of damage is yet to be ascertained as at the time of this report on Wednesday. But, firefighters are still at the plant station trying to control the fire. Though, there are speculations that the power plant belongs to the Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC), Frank William, Regional Communication Officer, Oyo Region of IBEDC, confirmed that the power plant belongs to Transmission Company of Nigeria (TRC) and not IBDEC as being speculated. “This is a fire outbreak at TRC Plant in Ring Road Ibadan. I can confirm for you. But, it does not belong to IBDEC. It is under Transition Company of Nigeria. “Fire fighters are there and I can confirm that there is a high level of damage control”. Efforts made by DAILY POST to get the reaction of the Head of Fire Service in Oyo State, Mr. Mashood Adewuyi proved abortive as calls put through to his mobile telephone number were not answered. Our correspondent recalls that the fire incident at TRC plant is coming barely twenty four hours after a fire outbreak was recorded along the Akala Expressway Elebu area of Ibadan. On Tuesday, some shops and houses were affected when fire broke out along the Akala Expressway in Ibadan. The shops are close to the popular Club 360 along Akala Expressway, Elebu. It was gathered that the fire incident which razed shops on that axis in the early hours of Tuesday broke out from one of the shops.

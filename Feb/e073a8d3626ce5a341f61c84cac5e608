Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has advised Lionel Messi to finish his career at Barcelona. Messi has been linked with a summer exit from the Camp Nou, following his public spat with sporting director, Eric Abidal. Abidal had accused the players of not working hard under former manager, Ernesto Valverde. Messi fired back in an Instagram post, asking him to name names or face his work. It had led to speculation that the Argentine could walk away and he has been linked with a possible reunion with Guardiola at City. However, speaking at a press conference on Friday, Guardiola said: “He’s a player from Barcelona. He will stay there. That is my wish: stay in Barcelona. “I think he’s going to finish his career there.”

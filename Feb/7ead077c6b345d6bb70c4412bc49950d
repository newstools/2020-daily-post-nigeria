Former Arsenal manager, Arsene Wenger, has spoken about how Frank Lampard has impressed him as Chelsea boss. Lampard guided Chelsea to a 2-1 victory over former boss Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur. The win extended their lead over Spurs to four points, with 11 games to go. Speaking to beIN Sports after the game, Wenger listed the attributes Lampard has, which will ensure he succeeds at a big club. “I feel like he has done well overall. When he had bad results he kept calm, kept the way of playing and I think you judge a manager when he starts with how he deals with disappointment. “Overall, he kept his way and it’s quite encouraging. I like his style of play, I like watching it. He makes some tough decisions, which you may not always agree with, but he has a way to conduct and he sticks to it. “He shows strong character and that’s what’s needed when you work at a big club,” Wenger said.

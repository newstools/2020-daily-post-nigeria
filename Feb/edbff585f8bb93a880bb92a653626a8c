The Ogun State Government has reacted to violent protest that erupted in Sagamu area of the state on Monday, following the death of a footballer , Kazeeem Tiamiyu, who was allegedly killed by operatives of Special Anti-robbery Squad (SARS). According to a statement made available to newsmen by the Special Adviser to Governor Dapo Abiodun on Communications, Mr Remmy Hazzan, the government called for calm and sued for peace. “In the first place, the extra-judicial death of any resident in Ogun State is a very painful one for the government, let alone that of a promising youth, whose death the government will leave no stone unturned to ensure justice is not only done, but also seen to have been done at the end of the day. “There is no doubt that our youth have the right to protest the killing of the late young football star.
However, what started as a legitimate peaceful protest was hijacked by criminally minded people, who turned same into a violent one. “As calm returns to the town, we urge the people, especially, the youth, to be law abiding and to go about their various businesses without taking laws into their hands. “Finally, the Government wishes to restate that no one is above the law. Therefore, after detailed proper investigations into the killing of the late football star, decisive action shall be taken against anyone found culpable, as they face the full wrath of the law”, the statement read.

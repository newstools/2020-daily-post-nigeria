Lagos-based senior lawyer, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, SAN, has reacted to the Supreme Court judgement that upheld the sack of former All Progressives Congress, APC governor-elect in Bayelsa State, David Lyon. Following his sack a day to the swearing-in ceremony, Lyon and his party, the APC, had returned to the apex court, asking the court to reverse its earlier ruling. But the court described the request by the APC to review its judgment voiding the participation of its candidate in the Bayelsa governorship election as vexatious, frivolous and an abuse of the court. It also slammed N60m fine against Afe Babalola, Olanipekun. Reacting to the court’s decision in a statement he signed and made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, Adegboruwa said, “Bravo to the Supreme Court. “Interest Rei Publicae Res Jidicatas Non Rescindi (It is in the interest of the State that things decided are not rescinded). “Let all candidates and their parties wait for the next election. We cannot because of a four year political tenure denigrate the most sacred institution of democracy. “I hail the Justices of the Supreme Court for their courage and sagacity, which should be replicated in all other frivolous applications still pending for review. “Enough is enough! The Court will rise!” Bayelsa: 'Leaders shouldn't emerge from courts' - Adegboruwa says, as Supreme Court sacks Lyon Bayelsa: Nigerians react as Supreme Court sacks Lyon, declares PDP winner APC vs PDP: INEC reacts as Supreme Court sacks Bayelsa governor elect

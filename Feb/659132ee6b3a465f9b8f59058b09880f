A High Court sitting in Lokoja, has declared the removal of Elder Simon Achuba, former Deputy Governor by the Kogi State House of Assembly as null and void, adding that the subsequent nomination of Chief Edward Onoja did not follow due process. Delivering Judgement on the matter brought before the court by Elder Simon Achuba on Thursday, Justice John Olorunfemi of the Lokoja High Court 4 declared the removal of the former Kogi State Deputy Governor, Elder Simon Achuba from office by the Assembly as a violation of the Constitution. The judge added that, the actions and subsequent nomination of another person to the office by the lawmakers was null and void. Elder Achuba had dragged Kogi State House of Assembly and 29 others to court following his controversial impeachment as the Deputy Governor of Kogi State on 18th October, 2020. Justice Olorunfemi, described the action of the Kogi State House of Assembly as a constitutional coup, hatched and executed in a democracy. He pointed out that, the action is contrary to Section 188 subsection 8, a section that stopped the Assembly from further action having discovered that the former Deputy Governor was not found wanting by the panel.

After about 23 games had won, I was just hoping that nothing should spoil this ticket, because this is my first time winning BIG. “The last game was Atletico Madrid v Barcelona, and I played Barcelona to win or draw in the first half. As soon as the first half ended 0-0, I knew I had won. I could not even shout. I was extremely happy. I will invest in a mechanical spare parts business, which I have always wanted to start. “I really like the win bonus. The odds are good too. I also like the way the customer service talk to me. They are always very nice.” Are you the next BIG winner? Visit www.betpawa.ng

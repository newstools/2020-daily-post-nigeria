According to Ramatu, even her pregnancy scans did not reveal that there was a problem with her babies or that they were conjoined. ” Throughout my nine months pregnancy, I didn’t feel any strange pain. It was normal the way I had the pregnancy of other children on different occasions. ” It was when I went to the hospital for delivery that I experienced little pain and delay. The doctor who took the delivery of the twins was surprised too. While speaking to DAILY POST, the doctor who delivered the babies, Dr. Amina Zero said the delivery of the twins had a little delay but was eventually successful. According to Dr. Amina, surgery for the conjoined would be conducted in a few weeks after the babies have gained some strength. ”All I have to say, the babies, the mother are doing fine. We shall do surgery for the conjoined in few weeks when the babies get strength and if we observe it will be healthy for them to separate them at that time”. She said

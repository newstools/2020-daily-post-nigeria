The alleged cold war in Kogi State Government House took a new twist weekend, following the suspension of the Chief Medical Director of the Kogi State Specialist Hospital, Dr. Ahmed Attah. DAILY POST, on Sunday, learnt that Dr Attah was suspended with immediate effect on Friday and has been directed to handover to the most senior officer of the hospital. Sources at the Government House told our correspondent that the suspended hospital CMD is a staunch loyalist of the Deputy Governor of Kogi State, Chief Edward Onoja. Another source who confided in DAILY POST said Dr Attah’s suspension is also hinged on his failure to comply with the single Treasury account in operation by the state government. The source said, “the inability of the Specialist Hospital to operate single Treasury account was as a result of the need to constantly pay Doctors the hospital employed recently and paid from the hospital’s coffers. “The hospital was operating a drug revolving scheme and would be pretty difficult to sustain the scheme if the money is paid into the state government account before seeking for approval and withdrawal when the hospital run out of stocks. “The hospital runs on medicals and other items like diesel, items considered very important on daily use. It was pretty difficult to run the single Treasury account”. A Hospital source told DAILY POST that there have been series of allegations leveled against Dr Attah through petition by some concerned members of the hospital. It was reliably gathered that some staff of the hospital had written a petition against the Chief Medical Director on the way he handled affairs and managed the hospital. Dr Ahmed Attah was appointed as CMD Kogi State Specialist Hospital in July 2019 by Governor Bello. Effort to speak with Attah through his phone line to confirm his suspension by DAILY POST proved abortive as of the time of filing this report. Attah hails from the Eastern Senatorial District of Kogi State.

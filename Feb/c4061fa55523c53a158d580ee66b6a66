Idris Yusuf, Commander of the 158 Battalion Gubio, NAN reports. Adeniyi said that the soldier pursued the insurgents and rescued the students unhurt. “On Feb. 9, Boko Haram insurgents came with 15 gun trucks between Magumeri and Gubio. They did a snap operation in less than two minutes and kidnapped three students. “The students were wearing school uniforms which made it easy for them to be identified. The insurgents are against western education and they abducted them. “The commanding officer mobilised the troops and went on hot pursuit of the insurgents’ with the help of the locals who provided intelligence. “We are happy the students are here with us safe and sound,” he said. Adeniyi further warned parents to stop their wards against wearing school uniform while travelling.

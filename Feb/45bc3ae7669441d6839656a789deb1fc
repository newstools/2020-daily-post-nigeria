There is tight security in and around the Supreme Court as the court hears application by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to review its judgment which sacked its governorship candidate in Bayelsa, David Pereworimin Lyon. Chief Afe Babalola, SAN, led the team of lawyers for Lyon and Deputy. Present in the court were Governor of Bayelsa State, Sen. Duoye Diri, National Chairman of the APC, comrade Adams Oshiomhole amongst others, NAN reports. The APC in the application filed by its team of lawyers led by Wole Olanipekun (SAN) needs the Supreme Court to set aside the “wrong” judgment that sacked Lyon. The party argued that the Supreme Court denied Lyon fair hearing when it proceeded to disqualify him as governorship candidate APC also faulted INEC’s decision to issue certificate of return to the candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). David Lyon vs Diri: APC returns to Supreme Court, makes demands Bayelsa: APC under 'fire' over attack on Supreme Court Bayelsa: Nigerians react as Supreme Court sacks Lyon, declares PDP winner

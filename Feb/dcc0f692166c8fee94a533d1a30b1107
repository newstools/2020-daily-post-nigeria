The Nigeria government has urged citizens with concerns of coronavirus infection, with or without signs and symptoms of illness, to test for the disease. The government also said with the help of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Nigeria now has the capacity to test for the virus. The Minister of Health, Dr Osagie Ehanire, said this in a statement issued by Mrs Enefaa Bob-Manuel, the Head of Media and Public Relations in the ministry on Sunday in Abuja. Coronavirus has been declared a global health emergency by the WHO. Ehanire, who thanked the WHO for its support, however, called on those who went to China in the past fortnight to “self isolate” for at least 14 days to protect their families and communities. “Such persons who develop fever, cough, sore throat or difficulty in breathing should also report to the nearest hospital for a check-up. “All healthcare workers who receive patients with symptoms like fever, cough, difficulty in breathing are to supply them masks and isolate them. “They should do so before contacting the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on 07032864444. “Nasopharyngeal or throat swabs are to be collected for testing for Coronavirus at NCDC,’’ he advised.

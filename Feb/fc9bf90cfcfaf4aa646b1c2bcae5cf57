Former Liverpool star, Michael Owen has predicted the outcome of the match between Manchester United and Everton at Goodison Park this weekend. Manchester United go into this weekend game unbeaten in seven matches in all competitions. The Red Devils defeated Club Brugge 5-0 in the Europa League in their last game on Thursday night. The likes of Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin are flourishing under the new Everton boss though and Goodison is once again becoming a fortress. “United were flattered by the margin of victory against Watford at Old Trafford on Sunday,” Owen wrote in his Betvictor column. “Everton had the opportunities to get at least a point at the Emirates on Sunday and the burgeoning partnership of Richarlison and Dominic Calvert-Lewin and remarkable return of Andre Gomes were plus points for the Blues who have improved significantly under Carlo Ancelotti. Owen noted that Goodison Park is never an easy place to go to and get a result for any team “and I expect the hosts to keep the points from what promises to be a terrific game.”

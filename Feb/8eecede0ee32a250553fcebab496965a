The House of Representatives, Thursday resolved to probe the Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, for failure to audit its accounts as required by law in the last four years. It, therefore, directed its Committee on Public Accounts to interrogate the agency without specifying the date to report back to the House. DAILY POST recalls that the Committee had grilled the Director-General of the agency Dr. Dakuku Peterside over the unaudited accounts and for failing to submit the same to the office of the Auditor-General of the Federation. The resolution of the lower chamber was based on the disclosure by the DG who said the agency had not submitted any audited accounts to the AGF office from 2015 till date. It was further explained that the agency only submitted its audited accounts to the AGF office in 2014. Besides, the DG affirmed that the irregular change of the chief executive officer of the agency was responsible for the sad development. However, the lawmakers blamed the DG for breaching the law knowing that all government agencies has no excuse but must submit it’s audited accounts to the Auditor-General ‘s office. The years, over which the audited accounts were not, hitherto, submitted include 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. Consequently, the lower chamber ordered for a total probe of the activities of the agency spanning from 2014 to 2019.

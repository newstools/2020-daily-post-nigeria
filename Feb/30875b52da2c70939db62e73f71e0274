Netherlands legend, Marco van Basten, has said that people who pick Cristiano Ronaldo over Lionel Messi, know nothing about football. The debate over who is the greatest player currently has rumbled on for years. For almost a decade, Messi and Ronaldo were direct rivals in LaLiga with Barcelona and Real Madrid. The Argentine won more league titles, while Cristiano clinched four Champions League titles in five seasons. Messi has taken home five Ballons d’Or, while the Portugal captain has four. But Van Basten feels the difference is very clear. “Cristiano is a great player, but those who say he is better than Messi know nothing about football, or they are saying it in bad faith,” he told Corriere dello Sport. “Messi is one of a kind. Impossible to imitate and impossible to repeat. A player like him comes along every 50 or 100 years.”

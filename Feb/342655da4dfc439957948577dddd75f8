The Special Adviser on Political and Legislative Matters to Yobe State governor, Alhaji Aji Yarima Bularafa (Mal Terab of Gujba) has debunked the allegations that governor Mai Mala Buni has relocated out of the state. Aji Yarima Bularafa stated this in an interview with newsmen in his office, in Damaturu. He said, “Anytime the governor goes out he looks for connection and it is for the betterment of Yobeans. “All the accusations they are making are absolutely rubbish, anytime the governor left the state he brings prosperity to the state and he cannot just stay here and depend on our normal subventions, that is the money they share every end of the month from the federation account. “We don’t have revenue accruing into the state as Internally generated revenue, what sources of revenue are we generating apart from the normal federation account money that is accruing to the Yobe State. “The governor has to go and make some connections, he was with France ambassador to Nigeria lobbying for Tetfund intervention in our tertiary Institutions and we are expected to benefit from the Tetfund fund.” Bularafa said the governor was also with Turkish ambassador discussing investment in mineral deposit in the state, stressing “to bring foreign investors to come and invest in Yobe, you have to go and tell them and convince them.”

The Independent National Electoral Commission( INEC) has declared the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Douye Diri, winner of the Bayelsa governorship election. INEC chairman, Prof Yakubu Mahmud on Friday declared Diri as the duly elected Bayelsa State Governor. Recall that the apex court had yesterday nullified the election of David Lyon and his Deputy, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo. The Apex court in a unanimous judgement sacked Lyon just a day before his inauguration. The panel led by Justice Mary Odili held that Lyon’s deputy, Degi-Eremieoyo presented a forged certificate to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).

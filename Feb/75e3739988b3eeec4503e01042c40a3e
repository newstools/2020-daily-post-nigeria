Juventus captain, Leonardo Bonucci has blamed the team for their 1-0 loss to Lyon in the Champions League round of 16 first leg in France on Wednesday. A lone strike from Lucas Tousart gave the home side a narrow win over the Italian champions heading into the second leg in Turin. Bonucci admitted that they made some mistakes in the first half that led to the defeat, but vowed that Juventus must progress to the quarter finals. “We made a mistake in the first half… We were always second, played long and we were distant between the departments and not very aggressive. And in certain games you pay for it,” he was quoted by the club’s official website. “They were good at hurting us when we were down to ten men, but we had to wake up first. Now we think about winning on Sunday, and then in the return leg: we must absolutely progress through.” Similarly, Juventus goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny blamed the loss to first half mistakes committed by his teammates. He also believes the Italian champions would turn things around in Turin. “We made a mistake in the first half, playing with little order,” he said. “We were better in the second half, but now we have to overturn everything in the return leg, starting from the good things done in the second half of this match.” Lyon scored the goal when Juve defender De Ligt was out receiving treatment for a head injury and Szczesny added, “The goal? Being a man down made the difference, but the action had to be stopped earlier.”

President Muhammadu Buhari has revealed why he told the Governor of the Central Bank, CBN, that not even a cent should be given for food importation going forward. Buhari said his government will continue to invest in agriculture, adding that the nation will make faster strides through it. The President stated this on Friday at State House, Abuja, when he received members of Council for New Nigeria Initiative (CNNI), led by Senator Abu Ibrahim. Buhari added, “With our vast population and land, agriculture is the way to go. We bumped into it by experience and common sense when we came in 2015. We encouraged people to go back to the land, and God has been kind to us, giving us three to four good rainy seasons in succession.” He pointed out that those who went into farming have no regrets, revealing that the government now saves millions of dollars that would have been expended on food importation. “We are almost self-sufficient in food production, and that was why I told the Governor of the Central Bank that not even one cent should be given for food importation. We have got more people back to the land, employment is being generated, and we will do more of it,” Buhari added. He commended members of CNNI, which is the successor to the National Committee for Buhari Support Groups, “for volunteering to do an unpopular job,” noting that, “it shows commitment and courage on your part.”

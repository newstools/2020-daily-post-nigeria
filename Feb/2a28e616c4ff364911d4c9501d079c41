Former Senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial district, Shehu Sani, has reacted to the visa ban on Nigerian and five other countries by the U.S. President, Donald Trump. DAILY POST reported earlier that U.S. President, Donald Trump imposed a visa ban on Nigeria and five other countries, which is expected to take effect on February 22. Sani who, was recently released from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) custody for alleged fraud, said the United States government has the right to impose a travel ban on Nigeria. He supposedly inferred that the ban is ’right’ since the Nigerian government also closed its borders months ago. The former Kaduna lawmaker on his Twitter page wrote: “You have the right to close your borders, they have the right to impose a travel ban.” Recall that Sani was recently released from EFCC custody after a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Monday, granted him bail over allegations of obtaining money by false pretence and misrepresentation. DAILY POST recalls that the anti-graft agency accused the erstwhile lawmaker of trying to collect a bribe of $25,000 from the Chairman of ASD Motors. Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has set a committee, chaired by the Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, to study and address U.S. requirements relating to the travel ban on Nigeria. Buhari disclosed that the committee would work with the U.S. Government, INTERPOL and other stakeholders to implement all necessary updates. “Nigeria remains committed to maintaining productive relations with the United States and its international allies, especially on matters of global security,” Buhari added.

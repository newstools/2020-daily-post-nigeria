The Senate, on Wednesday, demanded for the rehabilitation of the razed communities involved in communal clashes in Bassa Local government Area of Kogi State. DAILY POST gathered that certain places in Igbira and Komi communities were also affected. The upper chamber also urged the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development to provide with shelters, educational and health facilities to the internally displaced people. This resolution was sequel to an adopted motion at plenary sponsored by Senator Isah Jibrin representing Kogi East Senatorial district. Jibrin in his lead debate affirmed that the violent clashes that took place in 2016 and 2019 rendered over 100,000 people homeless and, thus, became refugees. He also pointed out that about 100 people were killed from Igbira, Bassa Komi communities while 146 persons were also killed by alleged ethnic militia besides the destruction of property worth millions of naira. The lawmaker said, “educational institutions have been destroyed, with many buildings and other facilities completely burnt down, thereby making it absolutely difficult for the children of the affected communities to access educational facilities. “The destruction of schools, health centers are obviously non-existent to cater for the health needs of the affected communities as the few hitherto existing ones have been lost to the hostilities, and this has increased the rate of mortality in the affected communities. “Markets, Petrol stations, shops and various business outfits in the affected communities have been completely destroyed, thereby throwing people to an inevitable state of economic helplessness.”

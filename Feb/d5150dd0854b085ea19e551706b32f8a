Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, has rejected a community policing format proposed by the Inspector-General of Police, IGP for the Southeast region. The BNYL also faulted Southeast leaders for accepting the idea. National leader of the group, Princewill Chimezie Richard while addressing reporters in Owerri, Imo State capital on Saturday, said that any security still controlled by the Federal government ends in futility. He lamented decision of the Southeast governors to sideline Ohanaeze Ndigbo and other Pan Igbo organizations who have rejected the proposed community policing. He said the leadership of Igboland and other areas in the east rest with these social-cultural organizations and not the political leaders “The Governors are not our leaders, they were elected and can be voted out in next election, the leaders of Igboland
and the entire east falls with the organizations because these groups communicate directly with the masses. “These Southeast governors should not undermine the power of powerful organizations in the region.” He accused the Igbo governors of dancing to the tune of the north and the federal government against the interest of the easterners. Richard said that “the Southeast governors are not decisive when it comes to dealing with the North. Who are those killing our people, are they not the same people that will be directly in control of the so called Community Policing. We reject this idea in its entirety.”

Real Madrid captain, Sergio Ramos has given Zinedine Zidane’s side two options following their 2-1 loss to Manchester City in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie on Wednesday night. The Los Blancos were defeated by Pep Guardiola’s men at the Santiago Bernabeu, after goals from Gabriel Jesus and Kelvin De Bruyne. Isco’s lone strike was not enough to give the home side a draw in front of their supporters. Ramos, who was sent off during the encounter following a foul on Jesus, wants Real Madrid to either think about their yesterday’s defeat against the Premier League champions or work for tomorrow’s victory. In reaction, Ramos, in a tweet on his official Twitter page on Thursday wrote: “After a very hard night, I see two options: we can think about yesterday’s defeat or work for tomorrow’s victory. “I choose the latter. Head and heart already in the Classic #HalaMadrid.” Real Madrid’s next clash is against Barcelona in La Liga El Clasico fixture on Sunday.

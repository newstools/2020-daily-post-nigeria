Former Vice-Chairman of National Democratic Coalition (NADECO) and prolific writer, Dr Arthur Agwuncha Nwankwo, is dead. The founder and chancellor of Eastern Mandate Union (EMU), died on Saturday. Born August 19, 1942, Nwankwo died at the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Enugu. On Sunday, President Muhammadu Buhari condoled with his family and Anambra people. In a statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina, Buhari urged everyone who knew the deceased to find solace in the contributions of the writer to national and global development. “President Buhari affirms that the late writer’s bridge-building efforts, like supporting the famous Handshake Across the Niger, and carefully picking the themes of his many publications to reflect national unity, while advocating for a collective vision, had served the purpose”, it reads. “The President believes Dr Nwankwo’s investments in humanity will endure, especially standing for democracy and development at great risks, and working hard to ensure that the pivotal institutions are strengthened and sustained.” Buhari prayed that the almighty God will receive the soul of the departed statesman, and comfort his family.

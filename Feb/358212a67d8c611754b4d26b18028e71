Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has paid tribute to Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, in recognition of the Portuguese achievements in his career as a coach so far. Mourinho, who has won league titles in Portugal, Spain, Italy and England, coached Lampard during his time at Stamford Bridge. Lampard, speaking ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash against Tottenham on Saturday afternoon, wished Mourinho all the best, adding that he has huge respect for the 57-year-old. “Mourinho is a manager that has huge talent,” Lampard was quoted by Mirror UK as saying. “His achievements in terms of medals and trophies speaks for themselves. “I have huge respect for him and I wish him all the best. “When we face each other, it is not about individual battle but team. “I want my team to win and he would also want his team to win either.” “Seeing Mourinho is always nice even as an opponent, we sometimes meet at restaurants, in the street and in the corridor of a stadium.”

At least, 811 Coronavirus deaths have been recorded in China. The figure surpasses that of SARS. The disease – in the same family with Coronavirus – broke out in the early 2000 and originated in China. It infected 8,000 people and killed 800 globally between 2002 and 2003. China National Health Commission on Sunday said the 89 new deaths and 2,656 new confirmed cases were reported, mostly in Hubei. 81 new deaths were reported over the last 24 hours in Hubei. Health authorities recorded a total of 33,738 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus since the beginning of the outbreak in December. On Friday, Osagie Ehanire, Minister of Health, says no one in Nigera has Coronavirus infection. He, however, assured that Nigeria had developed enough capacity to detect and isolate any case. Meanwhile, another killer disease is currently claiming lives in Benue State. The federal government says laboratory tests have shown that the illness is not Ebola, Lassa Fever or Coronavirus.

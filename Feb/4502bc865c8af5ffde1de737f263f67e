It appears the new alliance between Sen Rochas Okorocha and his successor, Hope Uzodinma is paying off, as members of the Action Alliance in the House of Representatives have decamped to the All Progressives Congress. The two lawmakers are Pascal Obi and Kingsly Chuma. Both Uzodinma and Okorocha have closed ranks following the outcome of the Supreme Court judgement that declared the former as the governor of Imo state. The two members of the Action Alliance who are loyal to Sen Okorocha announced their defection to the APC on Thursday through a letter read by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila. Governor Uzodinma and Okorocha were at the House chamber to witness the defection of the two members. The House Minority leader, Ndudi Elumelu raised a point of order, citing section 68 of the 1999 constitution as amended. He called for the seats of the lawmakers to be declared vacant, describing the defection as “illegal and not acceptable.” The Speaker, however, rejected the point of order, saying, “You are a member of PDP not a member of AA, you have no locus, you cannot go to court, because you are not aggrieved.”

A legal luminary, Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), has advised the Buhari government and the National Assembly to effect a constitutional change for decentralisation of Nigeria Police. Fagbemi spoke at the Law Week of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA), Okitipupa branch, on Saturday. The SAN said the security arrangement in the country should be rejigged to effectively tackle insecurity. He lamented that despite the huge budgetary allocations to defence since 2018, the spate of robbery, kidnapping, ritual killings and insurgencies had refused to abate. “Nigeria has porous land borders; our immigration practices must be tightened to ensure accountability for everyone that goes in and out of the country in order to check insecurity,” NAN quoted him as saying. Fagbemi urged government to invest heavily in social security and reduction of unemployment. The increase attacks by insurgents, bandits and kidnappers had led to calls for the sack of Service Chiefs.

Former Manchester United striker, Berbatov Dimitar, has said Odion Ighalo could be the perfect fit for the no. 9 role at Old Trafford. United have been without a dominant centre forward, after they sold Romelu Lukaku to Inter Milan last summer. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been left with Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial, who prefer to cut in from wide. With Rashford ruled out with a back injury, Solskjaer brought in Ighalo to bolster his attacking options. Berbatov feels that the Nigerian’s Premier League experience will be valuable to the Red Devils. He told Betfair: “I think it’s a good move for United because Ighalo has played in the Premier League, and did well with Watford, so he will know what to expect. “He’s scored plenty of goals in China and his record for Nigeria is impressive too. I want to see him play as soon as possible because I’m curious to see how he will fit in to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s plans. “Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial both like to cut in from the left so United have arguably lacked a natural No.9 this season. That’s what Ighalo should give them and I will be interested to see how they play with him in the side.”

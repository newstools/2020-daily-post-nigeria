Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov has backed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side to finish in the top-four position on the Premier League table this season. Berbatov believes the Red Devils are now in the driving seat to qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League following their 2-0 victory over Chelsea last Monday. “Man United’s victory against Chelsea has given the Old Trafford club a big boost in their hope to finish top-four and qualify for next season’s Champions League,” Berbatov told Betfair. “It is now a great chance for United to challenge for the top-four. “All their matches from at this point starting against Watford this weekend will be good step for them if they win or else what’s the point if they do not win? “Solskjaer’s men need that factor of consistency now to challenge for the position. “However, to finish top-four and qualify for the Champions League ahead of Chelsea and Tottenham is now in their hands.” Man United are currently three points behind fourth place Chelsea on the Premier League table.

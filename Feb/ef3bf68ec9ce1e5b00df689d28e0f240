A trader, identified as Jimoh Baba, in the Ita-Adu area in Ilorin, on Thursday told an Area Court that he was not ready to divorce his wife, Ramotalahi Jimoh. Jimoh, a resident of Ojagboro, in Ilorin, had approached the court for the dissolution of her 11-year-old marriage to Baba, on grounds that she no longer loves him, NAN reports. Baba, however, rejected his wife’s prayers and told the court that he was not ready for divorce. “I cannot release my children to her. I am not ready for any divorce now. Give me more time to come back and prove my case. “I have health challenges and I cannot explain further. Kindly help me with a new date to establish my case,” Baba begged the court. However, the wife told the court that she has no feelings for her husband anymore. ”My husband and I are living like rivals in our matrimonial home. “We are more of rivals than lovers. We never agree on the same thing. I want this honourable court to dissolve this union as soon as possible,” she said. She also prayed the court to grant her custody of the three children and sought an order compelling Baba to pay N15,000 monthly as a feeding allowance for the children. The Presiding Judge, Mr. Abdulhammed Aliyu in ruling adjourned the case until March 11 for hearing. Aliyu told the defendant to get a lawyer incase his health stops him from appearing before the court by the next adjourned date.

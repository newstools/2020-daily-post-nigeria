Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright has backed Chelsea to beat Manchester United when both teams clash in tonight’s Premier League fixture at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea played a 2-2 draw with Leicester City in their last Premier League fixture, while Man United played a goalless draw against Wolves. Providing his predictions, Wright was quoted by Metro UK as saying: “I want Chelsea to beat Man United for some reason. “Because I don’t know Man United’s forwards that are going to play on Monday night against Chelsea. “Will Ighalo going to come in and score for Solskjaer’s men? Hopefully, he does, and if not, I think Chelsea will win. “I expect Frank Lampard’s men to have a go at United, and it is up to them to put the visitors under huge pressure.”

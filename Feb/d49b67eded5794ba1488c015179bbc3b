Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has dismissed talk that a ‘weak’ Premier League, is the reason they will finally win the title this season. The Reds have a massive 22-point lead at the top of the table and are looking very likely to win the league for the first time in 30 years. Klopp’s men need 12 more points to be confirmed champions. Liverpool have won all their fixtures so far, only dropping points at Manchester United and their dominance has seen some critics question the strength of England’s top flight. “I couldn’t care less. I don’t think that any Liverpool supporter should have any concern for things like this. “We have no influence on the points they have, apart from the games when we played them. And these games are always proper games whether it is Tottenham, Chelsea, Arsenal , City or Manchester United. That is clear and while we have won most of those games so far they were always difficult. “So that says nothing about the [lowering] quality of the Premier League, especially when you look at City’s win over Real Madrid,” Klopp told the media ahead of this weekend’s game against Watford.

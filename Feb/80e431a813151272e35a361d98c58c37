Imo sweepers said to be abandoned by the immediate past government have taken to the streets of Owerri, demanding for reinstatement and payment of their salary arrears. The state coordinator, Rufus Okarinwe, while speaking to DAILY POST said the Imo sweepers have been there right from Achike Udenwa’s regime until the coming of Emeka Ihedioha when they were laid off unceremoniously. “While we worked for Owelle Rochas Okorocha, we were duly paid. The same way with former governor Ikedi Ohakim.” “This our work is like an empowerment program for Imo women under the office of Her Excellency, and successive governments have keyed into it.” “Few days after Emeka Ihedioha was declared winner, we saw unknown faces at every nook and cranny telling us that they have taken over our job. They told us that we are APC and their party, PDP has taken power.” The coordinator further stated that his executives were lured to the government house by one Hon. Ulonna Njoku and forced to sign a disengagement letter in the midst of security personnel. He appealed that since the APC government is back in the state, the sweepers be called back and paid their two months salary arrears. Meanwhile, he said that Imo sweepers have been enjoying a long cordial relationship with APC government, reaffirming their support for Hope Uzodinma’s government. He asked the Governor to sack the PDP workers and reinstate them, expressing happiness that their party has taken over.

The reported dirty fight in Aso Villa, Abuja, the seat of Nigeria’s government may do serious damage to the present administration of President Muhammadu Buhari if not checked on time. Already the unwarranted fight has created negative impressions among a cross section of Nigerians who now doubt the capacity of President Buhari to continue in office as the insecurity question continues unabated. Arch Saliu Suleiman, Taliban Lafiagi, a senior lecturer with the University of Ilorin, told DAILY POST in Ilorin Thursday “it is embarrassingly unfortunate.” “It seems to me that there is an irreconcilable difference between the two gladiators which the president ignored. “The president must intervene immediately to forestall any possible damage to the already bad security architecture.” In his reaction, Dr Femi Biala, of Life Care Hospital, Gaa Akanbi, Ilorin, declared that “Buhari is ignorant about governance and instead of hiring technocrats, he engaged his playmates.” “It is very unfortunate Nigeria wasted another eight years of good leadership and governance,” he added. Also reacting, Dr Adeyemo of Olutayo Hospital, Zango quarters, Ilorin, said “It is actually a clash of interest arising from poorly defined roles and responsibilities of the two characters in question. “However, it is one clash too many because it concerns Nigeria’s security and does not speak well of the ruling party.” A security expert and retired senior staff of the Department of State Security Service, Dr Abdulsalam Ajanaku, blamed the whole scenario on what he called “institutional weakness of the presidency.” He said “the duo are not at fault because the president does not know what he is doing.” “What concerns the Chief of Staff (bloody civilian) with service chiefs’ management of internal security, there is nowhere in the world where service chiefs will take instructions from civilians other than the Commander in Chief,” he stated.

The leader of the Boko Haram sect, Abubakar Shekau has given President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government conditions to release the remaining Chibok schoolgirls still in captivity. Shekau said the remaining Chibok schoolgirls would be released once the government frees Boko Haram members currently in detention. The sect leader made the demand in a video released 24 hours after President Muhammadu Buhari was in Borno State on a sympathy visit. In the video obtained by DAILY POST, Shekau also warned Buhari not to return to the state because members of the group are fully on ground in the north-east. He warned that Buhari will be attacked if he returns to the state. The sect had in 2014 under the then administration of President Goodluck Jonathan abducted about 276 girls from Government Secondary School, Chibok, Borno state. About 100 abductees are still in captivity. Just last Sunday, the sect attacked Auno near Maiduguri in Borno State, and left about 30 people dead. Following the attack, President Buhari paid a sympathy visit to Maiduguri to condole with the governor and people of Borno State.   #BokoHaram leader, Shekau threatens President Buhari, army chief, Buratai .

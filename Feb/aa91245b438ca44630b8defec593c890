Manchester City midfielder, Kevin De Bruyne, has said they will be regarded as failures if they don’t win the Champions League. City won every trophy in England last season, clinching the last two Premier League titles in the process. However, Pep Guardiola has found it hard to conquer Europe again since he moved to the Etihad. Their 2016 run to the semi-finals is the closest they have to come to lifting the trophy. City play Real Madrid in the last 16 this week and De Bruyne has called on his team-mates to go the whole distance. “If we don’t win it [the Champions League] everybody is going to say we are failures like the last five years! “It’s something we’ve not won yet. We always want to win everything but sometimes another team is better or performing well – like Liverpool are doing this season. “It’s just that way and you just have to admit it. But we will just go there to win that game. You can’t look too much forwards and see what’s going to happen,” the Belgian told reporters.

Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski, will miss the return leg of their Champions League last-16 clash against Chelsea. Lewandowski picked up a knee problem during the first leg on Tuesday, which ended 3-0 in favour of the Bundesliga champions. The Poland international set up Serge Gnabry to score the first two goals, before adding the last goal at Stamford Bridge. However, he partially fractured the tibial edge in his left knee joint during game and has been ruled out for four weeks. Lewandowski will also miss the DFB-Pokal quarter-final with Schalke, as well as a number of Bundesliga games. He could return after the next international break, with Bayern set to play Borussia Dortmund in a potential title decider on April 4.

Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and his successor, Ahmad Lawan, on Saturday met at a gathering in Uyo, Akwa Ibom state. The duo were guests at the burial of late Gabriel Emmanuel Nkanang, father of the governor of Akwa Ibom State, Emmanuel Udom.  Pa Udom passed away in December 2019. Saraki, a Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) leader and Lawan of the All Progressives Congress (APC) were seen in a cordial mood as they exchanged pleasantries. In 2015, Lawan was endorsed by the APC leadership to become the Senate President but Saraki, who was then in APC, emerged.  The Uyo event has a lot of prominent Nigerians across parties, political strata and business in attendance.

The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma has denied allegations of corrupt practices in his administration. In a statement signed by his spokesman, Oguwike Nwachukwu, Uzodinma claimed the allegations were from those who worked with the previous administration headed by Emeka Ihedioha. According to Uzodinma, his government is made up of credible people who have zero tolerance for criminality. “The government of Imo State under Senator Hope Uzodinma is made up of credible Imo sons and daughters who have zero tolerance for criminality. “The rumour, therefore, making the sounds on alleged looting in Imo State Government House is nothing but a lie from the pit of hell. The rumour is engineered by members of the previous administration and their agents who are experts in assets stripping. They are yet to come to terms with the fact that the era of looting of government property is gone forever with their ouster from government,” part of the statement read. The Supreme Court has adjourned the hearing of Ihedioha and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)’s application, to review its earlier verdict on the Imo State governorship election until March 2, 2020. Ihedioha and PDP are praying the court to, among others, reverse its judgment on January 14 which sacked Ihedioha and replaced him with Uzodinma.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has warned Adams Oshiomhole, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to steer clear of Bayelsa state. PDP claimed that Oshiomhole was plotting to trigger violence in the state, over Thursday’s judgment of the Supreme Court that sacked the APC governor-elect, David Lyon. The judgment may pave the way for PDP’s candidate, Senator Douye Diri, to be sworn-in as governor on Friday, February 14. Oshiomhole, reacting to the judgement, insisted that Diri cannot be sworn in, alleging that PDP did not garner the stipulated votes during the election. However, the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, “The people of Bayelsa state know as a fact that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) under our laws cannot take instructions from any individual, let alone a factional national chairman of a dysfunctional political party like the APC. “The PDP, as a law-abiding party, counsels Oshiomhole to rein in himself and desist from all odious designs against Bayelsa state, her people and government”.

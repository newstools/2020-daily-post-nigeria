Most filling stations in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital have shut down operations following the disagreement between tanker drivers and security agencies in the state. Our correspondent who monitored the industrial action by the filing station operators reports that queues have continued to build up in most filling stations in the state capital. Speaking on the action, the National Treasurer of the National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Employees, NUPENG, Alex Agwanwa explained that the action was due to the inability of security agents to respect the understanding they reached with them last weekend. Agwanwa who is also the Chairman of the United Labour Congress in Rivers state told DAILY POST that between last Sunday and today, more trucks have been arrested alongside the drivers by security agencies. “Instead of maintaining our understanding they decided to arrest more trucks. As we speak, 27 trucks carrying legal products have been arrested. It is unacceptable. “This matter has been on for the past 2 years. We did not want it to get to this stage but here we are,” he said. The NUPENG National Treasurer maintained that the filings stations would remain shut until all their members and trucks seized by the security agencies are released.

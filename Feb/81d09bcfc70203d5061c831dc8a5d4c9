It was all fun and good cheer when the latest homeowners in town were handed the keys to their homes at Anchor Grounds. Anchor Grounds is a housing project by REFin Homes, which was launched on Wednesday 29th January 2020. The various house owners paid for their properties with a combination of our different flexible payment plans. Some were outright payments using our product called INSTANT HOME OWNER, some were incremental payments as the project hit different milestones- a product called OWN A HOME and some paid half the total cost upfront and then the balance was spread over 3years with a product called FLEXI HOME OWNER. Anchor Grounds consists of fully serviced 3 bedroom terraces with boys quarters and 2 bedroom flats, a swimming pool, playground, adequate parking and a facility management office.

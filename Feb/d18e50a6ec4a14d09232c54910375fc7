An Accra Circuit Court has sentenced a 42-year-old father, Daniel Kwame Baah, to 20 years imprisonment for impregnating his daughter The convict was tried before the court with two counts of defilement of a child under the age of 16 and incest. He pleaded guilty to the charges, GhanaWeb reported. The father had forcibly had sex with his own 14-year-old daughter and sexually abused her on multiple occasions. His first encounter with the victim, who is 14, occurred in June 2019 when he forcibly inserted his finger into her private part while she slept and sexually abused her until she became pregnant. He was dragged to court after the Girl Child Advocate attached to the victim’s primary school ‘Anyaa L/A Primary School’ discovered the pregnant victim in school uniform and questioned her. She narrated her ordeal and the matter was reported to the police and the convict was arrested. The judge, in ruling, sentenced Daniel Kwame Baah to 20 years’ imprisonment with hard labour for each count to serve as deterrent to others However, the sentences will run concurrently, so he will serve 20 years instead of 40.

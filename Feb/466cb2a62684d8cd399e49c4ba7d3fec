The Nigeria Defence Academy (NDA), Kaduna, on Friday matriculated 529 cadets of 71 Regular Course. In his speech, the Commandant of NDA, Maj.-Gen. Jamil Sarham warned the cadets against indiscipline and charged them to be loyal and dedicated to their studies. “The military profession is one of the oldest professions in human history, in this regards officer cadets training has continued to evolve in response to the dynamics of national defense and global security environment. “NDA is also committed in molding the character of cadets while preparing them to earn degrees and be commissioned into the respective services of the Armed Forces of Nigeria. “You must therefore desist from any act of indiscipline; you must not only be serious with your training but must also take full responsibility for your actions, as every action has a corresponding consequence”, Sarham said. In his remarks, the special guest at the matriculation, AVM Musa Aisimi (rtd), charged the cadets to distinguish themselves. “At this stage, your characters are being reformed, hence, you all must uplift your status to become officers and gentlemen.” Aisimi said that what makes one successful in military service is zeal, hard work, character, knowledge, wisdom and right attitude. Last week, the NDA expelled some cadets and demoted others found wanting in discipline and general conduct.

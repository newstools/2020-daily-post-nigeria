Barcelona manager, Quique Setien, has said he is considering several names, as the club continue its search for new strikers. Setien, speaking to reporters on Saturday, however admitted he would need authorisation from the club, before he can complete any deal. Barca are suffering from an injury crisis, but could be given special dispensation to do a deal outside of the transfer window. Regulations grant permission for clubs to do business away from the window if circumstances dictate, and the champions are hopeful of being able to go back into the market this month. “It’s obvious we need another attacker, there are several names on the table but it depends on many things. “First of all, we will need authorisation,” Setien said. Barca travel to Real Betis on Sunday in the league.

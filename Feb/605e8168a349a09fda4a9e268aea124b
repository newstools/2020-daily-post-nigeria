The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has raised fears that the results and data of the 1999 and 2003 general elections were missing. The commission’s National Commissioner on Election and Party Monitoring, Prof. Anthonia Okosi-Simbina made this known on Thursday. Prof. Okosi-Simbina, a former member of the Nigeria Institute of Social and Economic Research, however, added that researchers did not find it difficult to trace the 2019 general elections results which were already online. She said this during a one-day workshop to look at the proposed compendium of the results of 2007, 2011 and 2015 general elections. The event was organised by the Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research, Ibadan, Oyo State. She said “the programme focused on preparing a compendium of 2007, 2011 and 2015 general elections results because data of the 1999 and the 2003 general elections’ results were not available.” According to her, there were no particular findings from the 2007, 2011 and 2015 general elections results. She explained further that the difficulty they encountered in the research process before her appointment as a national commissioner “was that the 2007, 2011 and 2015 general elections results were collected individually without proper organisation.” She added, “You need to organise them from the polling units, constituencies and local governments. We want people to get the statistics of the voters; the women, the men, artisans and the rural dwellers.”

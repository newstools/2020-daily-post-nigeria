The police in Ogun State have arraigned one Mrs. Funmilayo Ayodele before an Ogun Magistratesâ€™s court sitting in Abeokuta. The 40-year-old Ayodele was dragged before the court Friday for allegedly refusing to pay back a N600,000 loan she borrowed from a Cherubim and Seraphim church cooperative society at Lantoro Abeokuta. The police said Ayodele was docked on a three-count charge bordering on theft, fraud and breach of public peace. But the woman has pleaded not guilty to the charges. According to the Prosecution Counsel, Inspector Olu-Balogun Lawrence, the defendant allegedly borrowed the money in February 2019 from one Pastor Micheal Oguntade, promising to pay back in August same year after starting a business. However, the prosecution counsel said Ayodele, instead of refunding the money, resorted to threatening the pastor with thugs in his house; the reason why she was reported to the police. She has since been granted bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. The Magistrate, Olakunleyin Oke, said the sureties must be persons living within the court jurisdiction with evidence of tax payments to the Ogun Government. The case has been adjourned until Feb. 21 for trial.

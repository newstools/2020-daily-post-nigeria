An Ikeja Sexual Offences and Domestic Violence Court have remanded a 23-year-old security guard, identified as Saviour Udoh at a custodial facility for defiling a five-year-old girl in a church premises. Justice Sybil Nwaka ordered Udoh’s remand after his not guilty plea to a charge of sexual assault, NAN reports. Earlier, the state prosecutor, Mr. Gbenga Alagbe, told the court that the defendant committed the offense on Dec. 12, 2018, at the premises of Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) at No. 19, Oshifila St., Anifowose, Ikeja, Lagos. Alagbe said the defendant, who also worked as a cleaner at the church assaulted the girl at the children’s department when she was asleep, NAN reports. “Udoh approached the child and had sexual intercourse with her,” the prosecutor said. He said the child revealed what transpired to her mother (name withheld) and the guard was arrested. The offense contravenes Section 259 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The presiding judge, Nwaka then adjourned the case until March 24 for trial.

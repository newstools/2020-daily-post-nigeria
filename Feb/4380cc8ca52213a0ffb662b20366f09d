Meteorologists have blamed the recent excessive heat in the environment on climate change. Professor Akuro Gobo in an interview with DAILY POST, said the ozone layer, which is a protective measure has been depleted by human activities such as gas flaring, Bush burning and the black soot. Professor Gobo, who is also the Director; Institute of Geo-Sciences and Space Technology in Rivers State University, said the lack of urbanization planning is also part of the causes of the heat, as houses are now built without proper spacing for natural air. The Professor said the heat, which causes dehydration has affected productivity of individuals in the office, just as he advised that more trees should be planted to replace the ones that are cut down. “Generally, we can say the heat we are witnessing is as a result of the climate change and the depletion of the Ozone Layer as a result of flare, bush burning and endless emissions. “Another major cause of the heat we are experiencing especially in major cities like Lagos and Port Harcourt is as a result of urbanization. Hitherto, areas that were once reserved areas have been industrialized. So, there is no space to plant trees and flowers. “What we are experiencing is man made, nature is merely fighting back,” he said.

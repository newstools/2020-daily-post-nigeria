Armed bandits that kidnapped a traditional leader and his son in Zamfara State have released the son of the District Head of Gayari town in Zamfara State, Yasir Mohammed , after collecting a motorcycle as ransom. DAILY POST gathered that the district Head of Gayari , Alhaji Hassan Mohammed, was kidnapped by bandits along with his son, Yasir Mohammed in Gummi Local Government Area of Zamfara state. The kidnappers later released the district Head and detained his son, demanding a brand new motorbike as ransom before the monarch’s son could regain freedom. Addressing newsmen in Gusau, the state capital about the ordeal, a family member , Alhaji Faruku Gayari , said , “When we realised that the bandits were not ready to release Yasir without the motorcycle , we have to tax ourselves to buy it and deliver it to them .” Faruku explained that Yasir was released on Sunday but could not get back home until Monday afternoon . “He trekked for almost 13 hours from the forest where he was kidnapped to their family house as the bandits refused to help him out to the main road . “He was moving helplessly and without strength in the forest , trying to locate the main road until he arrived at one village and was guided by some villagers, showing him the direction to follow .” Faruku noted that Yasir was in good health , despite all odds and the trauma he passed through in the hands of the notorious kidnappers.

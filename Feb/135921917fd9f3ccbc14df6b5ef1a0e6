Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, has disclosed that he expects Manchester City to be really up against his side after UEFA’s decision to ban Pep Guardiola’s side from the Champions League for the next two years. Zidane’s men will take on Man City in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 clash later this month. DAILY POST had reported on Friday that UEFA handed Man City a two-year ban from all European competitions. The Citizens were found guilty of overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts and failing to cooperate in the investigation and have been fined €30million. “I do not want to talk about Man City’s Champions League ban because it is not my place to do so,” Zidane told Real Madrid’s official website on Saturday ahead of his side’s La Liga with Celta Vigo on Sunday night. “I like speaking about football, and our clash against Man City won’t be any different, because they are so very competitive and energetic team. “Guardiola’s side will be really up for it against us, particularly now that they are doing great in the Premier League. “It will be a tough match against them.”

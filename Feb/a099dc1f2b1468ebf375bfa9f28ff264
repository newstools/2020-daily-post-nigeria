Femi Fani-Kyaode, former Minister of Aviation has condemned the proposal by Miyetti Allah leadership to recruit its members in South West security outfit, Amotekun. DAILY POST reported that Alhaji Yakubu Bello, Chairman, Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeder Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) Oyo State chapter giving his support for the establishment of Amotekun proposed his members be incorporated in the security outfit. Bello said this at the public hearing on Oyo State Security Network Agency Bill, 2020, held in Ibadan, adding that not all Fulani men are bad. But, Fani-Kayode in a post on his Twitter page kicked against the inclusion of Miyetti Allah members into Amotekun. The PDP Chieftain noted that such inclusion will be like recruiting the ‘demons into an army of angels’ which cannot work in the region. Fani-Kayode wrote: “Recruiting Miyetti Allah into Amotekun is like recruiting hyenas into an army of lions. It’s like recruiting vultures into an army of eagles. It’s like recruiting sharks into an army of dolphins. “It’s like recruiting Nazis into the Israeli Defence Force. It’s like recruiting the Ku Klux Klan into the ranks of the Black Panthers. It’s like recruiting Hutus into an Army ofTutsis. It’s like recruiting the white Boers into Nelson Mandela’s ANC.”

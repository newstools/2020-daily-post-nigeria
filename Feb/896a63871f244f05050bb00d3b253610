Manchester United have been handed a significant boost ahead of their Premier League clash with Chelsea on February 17 at Stamford Bridge. This is after Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, confirmed that defender, Axel Tuanzebe, and midfielder, Scott McTominay are in contention to feature against Frank Lampard’s side following their recovery from injuries. According to Solskjaer, both Tuanzebe and McTominay has joined the Red Devils’ squad for their winter training in Spain in a bid to get match fitness ahead of Chelsea clash. Both Tuanzebe and McTominay have not played for United since December due to injuries. “Scott has improved in his recovery than we expected,” Solskjaer told MUTV on Saturday. “Therefore, he has been included in our winter training squad in Spain. “Axel has also been included in the squad, and all being well, both of them will be part of the training sessions. “It is helpful for them to use this period to train with the rest of the teammates after a long absence. “These are the two positives news from the squad so far.”

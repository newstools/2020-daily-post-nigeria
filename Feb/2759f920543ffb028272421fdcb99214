Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has reacted to Odion Ighalo being left behind, as the squad travels for their warm-weather training in Spain. The club, in a statement, explained that Ighalo will remain in Manchester, because there is no assurance he will be allowed back into the country. Three cases have already been confirmed in the UK. Solskjaer, who brought in Ighalo on a six-month loan deal last week, told the club’s official website: “Odion will stay in Manchester, because he arrived from China in the last 14 days. “Because of the situation in China, we’re not sure if he’d be allowed back into England if he leaves the country again, so he’s staying here working with a personal coach, individual programme and his family then can settle in England as well. “Of course he might have liked to have come with the players and got to know them, but the risk [of potential border restrictions tightening], we don’t want to take that.”

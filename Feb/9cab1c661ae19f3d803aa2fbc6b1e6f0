Former Gov. Gbenga Daniel of Ogun State, on Thursday, provided possible solution to the Federal Government on how to solve myriad of security challenges. Daniel while speaking at the public presentation of a book entitled “Wisdom Nuggets for Daily Living” in Abeokuta on Thursday urged the federal govetemmy to provide employment opportunities for the youth to solve insecurity issues. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the book is authored by the Special Adviser to Gov. Dapo Abiodun on Public Communications, Remmy Hazzan. Daniel added that unemployment remains the biggest threat to Nigeria’s security. He also urged the government to do more in the fight against insecurity, beyond the use of force. “The biggest challenge we have in Nigeria now is insecurity; but, it is information. What has happened today is a conglomeration of communicators, and I am particularly happy to join them. “We need to continually educate our people; we need to give them quality information because where information is missing, all sorts of mischief happen and the nation can be destroyed through that. “I think clearly, we have not done enough in trying to secure our environment. The way I look at security is more than getting ammunition and chasing ourselves. “The first thing is to make sure that people are employed. It is after that that you will be able to see who constitutes security risk. So for me, providing employment for our people is the first thing to do in fighting insecurity,” he said.

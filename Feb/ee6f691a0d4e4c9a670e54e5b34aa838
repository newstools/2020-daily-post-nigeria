A former Kwara State Commissioner for Information, Ben Duntoye, has dumped the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress(APC). Duntoye and his supporters jumped ship at Okerimi Oro in Irepodun Local Government Area of Kwara State. “Ordinarily, we are not people who jump from one party to another”, the Nation quoted him as saying. “But after a critical review of this administration, we are left with no other choice than to dump the PDP for APC to join hands with the Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq to move the state forward.” Duntoye, a commissioner under the Bukola Saraki administration, further noted that the APC “has brought a new paradigm shift in the governance of the state”. He pledged his loyalty to the platform and promised positive contributions that would move the party forward. In attendance were APC chairman in Kwara South, Olayemi Olabanji, Deputy Chief of Staff to the Governor, Princess Bukola Babalola, member of the House of Assembly representing Irepodun Constituency, Tayo Awodiji, member representing Share/Oke Ode Constituency, Owolabi Olatunde Rasaq, among others.

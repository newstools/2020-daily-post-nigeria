Mexican-American fighter, Andy Ruiz Jr, has disclosed that he wants to fight WBC world heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury. Ruiz, who lost to British fighter, Anthony Joshua, in their rematch last December, said this while reacting to American boxer, Deontay Wilder’s defeat to Fury. DAILY POST recalls that Fury defeated Wilder in the 7th round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, USA, to regain the WBC world heavyweight title last weekend. “I think Tyson Fury did an awesome job against Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas,” Ruiz told PBC on Fox. “He stuck to the game-plan and used his height advantage to hit Wilder in the ear, and the American never recovered from it. “I was so shocked because I thought Wilder was going to win against Fury, but I just want a shot with Tyson Fury as well.”

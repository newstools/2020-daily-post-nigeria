A number of Borno State residents fled their homes Wednesday evening. This followed an attack by Boko Haram at Jiddari-Polo area, near Maiduguri, the state capital. A video on social media shows people of different ages trekking inward the city centre, away from the violence. The fresh battle occured few hours after President Muhammadu Buhari left Borno on a sympathy visit. Buhari, was booed, during the visit. Security forces have been drafted to the area and are exchanging fire with the terrorists. A resident of the area told DAILY POST that his brother, a security operative, called him on phone with a warning not to return home soon. Also, a staff of a non-governmental organisation living in the area, said they were advised to remain indoors and hide. “I just received a text from our security manager that we should not to cone out but remain indoors and ensure we find safest area in the house to hide”, he disclosed. Another resident stated that he had fled his home to Pompomari at the far end of the city. “I came in from office and wanted to take a bath when I started hearing sound of gun shots. You know our area has always been their (Boko Haram) route to Maiduguri. “Immediately, I grabbed my car key and fled before the clash with soldiers. I learnt that they have been repelled but I am sleeping somewhere else tonight,” he said. Attempts to get response from both the military and the Police in Maiduguri proved abortive as their phones were off as at press time.   #BokoHaram strikes #Borno immediately after #PresidentBuhari ‘s visit A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Feb 12, 2020 at 11:56am PST

Jose Mourinho has said finishing in the top four with Tottenham Hotspur, will be a bigger achievement than coming second in the 2017/2018 season with Manchester United. Mourinho takes his Spurs side to Chelsea in Saturday’s early kick-off, one point behind the Blues who are currently fourth. The Portuguese had previously claimed that finishing as runners-up with United was most remarkable in his career, because “people don’t know what is going on behind the scenes”. However, Mourinho travels to Stamford Bridge without both Harry Kane and Son Heung-Min, who are out with long term injuries. When asked at a news conference on Friday if top four success would top his 2018 achievement, Mourinho replied: “In these circumstances? Yes. “Not just for me. Not my achievement. Collectively for the team. For the boys, if we manage in fourth without Harry and Son will be something incredible. It will be an incredible achievement for the boys so we have to give everything we have.”

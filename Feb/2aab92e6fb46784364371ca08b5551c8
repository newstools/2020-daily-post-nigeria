The national body of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, has kicked against the declaration of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP’s Douye Diri as the governor-elect of Bayelsa State by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. The party rejected INEC decision, saying that it will seek legal redress to reclaim its mandate. This was said by the National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole, during a press conference in Abuja on Friday. Oshiomhole said INEC committed “illegally by declaring Diri as Governor-elect.” The former Edo State Governor accused the electoral umpire of appropriating judicial powers to itself over the Supreme Court ruling. Oshiomhole said the nullification of the election of Lyon was an injustice that favoured the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He stated that the APC recognises that haven issued certificate to PDP candidate, “there are viable legal windows that we will be explored.” “We affirm our confidence in the judiciary even with pain in our hearts. “The Supreme Court for good reason, gave a conditional order that INEC should swear in the second candidate with the highest number of votes and the required constitutional spread.” “Clearly, the votes scored by PDP and its candidate in that election only met requirements in five Local Government Areas (LGAs)and you need six LGAs to meet the requirement of two third. PDP candidate did not satisfy this requirement,” Oshiomhole added.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said he knew Liverpool would win the Premier League title, after they defeated Manchester City in November. The Reds are currently 22 points ahead of City, following the latest round of fixtures. Liverpool hammered Southampton 4-0, while Pep Guardiola’s men lost 2-0 to Mourinho’s team. However, Mourinho feels the title was won and lost, when the Reds beat the champions 3-1 in November. “I had the feeling early in November when I was with you, I had that feeling. “I know how difficult it is to win a third league in a row. It’s hard, it’s difficult. “But they [Man City] are still a fantastic team. Fantastic team, fantastic players, fantastic manager. “So for us to beat them is very good and the way the table is, you lose two matches you almost go to relegation, you win two matches you get up, and it was so important for us. So, so important,” Mourinho told Sky Sports.

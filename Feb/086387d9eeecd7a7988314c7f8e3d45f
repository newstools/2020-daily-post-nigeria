Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane says the club signed forward, Eden Hazard from Chelsea last summer because the Los Blancos know what the Belgium international brings to the team. Zidane also described Hazard as a unique player, adding that the 28-year-old is ready to play for Real Madrid after being out of action for three months due to injury. Hazard had suffered a “micro-fracture” in his ankle during Madrid’s 2-2 draw against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League last November. Speaking ahead of his side’s La Liga clash with Celta at the Santiago Bernabéu on Sunday night, Zidane was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying: “Hazard is a unique player and I am so glad he is back from injury having been out of action for three months. “Real Madrid know what he brings to the squad and that is why we signed him from Chelsea. “He is an exceptional player, he is ready to play because he is now fit and he will play against Celta on Sunday.”

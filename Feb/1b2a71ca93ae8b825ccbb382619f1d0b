Brazil legend, Ronaldo, has claimed he never wanted to leave Barcelona in 1997. In an interview with DAZN, Ronaldo revealed that he was given a contract extension, which the club later withdrew. He spent only one season with the LaLiga side, before Barca sold him for a world record offer of £19.5million from Inter Milan. “I’d signed a contract renewal at the end of the season and I went away with the Brazil national team. “Five days later, they called me to tell me that I couldn’t continue with the renewal. “It was never in my hands. I wanted to stay. “If the club didn’t value me as I thought they should, then the decision wasn’t in my hands. I would have liked to have stayed, but it wasn’t up to me,” Ronaldo said.

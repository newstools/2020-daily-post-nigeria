No fewer than 10 members of a family were burnt to death by bandits who invaded Bakali village in Fatika District, Giwa Local Government Area of Kaduna State. The bandits who invaded the community on Tuesday at about 4:00pm locked up members of the same family, set the house abaze and burnt all the occupants of the building. They moved ahead and burnt many bags of grains, vehicles, and motorcycles in the village. A member of the community, Alhaji Sani Bakali, who confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Wednesday, said over 100 bandits besieged their village and caused grave harm. “The bandits locked up 16 members of the same family in a room and set it on fire,” he said The Kaduna bandits are known for a series of terror-related violence, kidnappings, gun-running, cattle rustling, and other heinous crimes in the country. DAILY POST recalls that a week ago, bandits attacked the aircraft using sophisticated anti-aircraft rifles and GPMG. The Nigeria Police Force said it had killed about 250 terrorists and bandits during an early morning operation in Kaduna State.

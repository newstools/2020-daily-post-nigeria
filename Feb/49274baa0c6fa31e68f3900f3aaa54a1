The Ilorin Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, has arrested a senior official of the Kwara State Ministry of Finance, Mrs Olajumoke Rhoda Oyawoye for allegedly defrauding many job seekers under the guise of helping them to secure jobs in both Federal and state employments. Oyawoye, a grade level 14 officer with the Kwara State Ministry of Finance, allegedly received various sums amounting to about N3m from her victims who are seeking for jobs and issued them fake appointments. Trouble started for the senior Kwara civil servant when two separate petitioners, Solomon Moronfoye and Salami Olalekan Abdulgafar,approached the Ilorin Zonal office of the commission, alleging that Mrs Oyawoye claimed she had been helping people to secure employments in both Federal and state civil service. According to the petitioner “I met her on April 27,2018, in my church in Offa,she informed me and other church members that she used to help people get employment at the Kwara state civil service and federal government parastatals, she told me that the money for the state employments is N250,000 per slot, while the one for the federal government parastatals is N350,000.” He stated further, “I met her again in Ilorin. I informed her that my children and other church members were interested in both state and Federal appointments which includes the Nigerian Immigration Service of which she gave me three with names of interested applicants. I gave her the sum of N2m and he assured that the applicants have already been employed.” In September, I discovered that all what she had said was false and the people she collected money from through me were pestering me to return their money and she kept giving series of excuses.” Items recovered in her house included Curriculum vitae (CVs) of her victims, offer letters of appointments of both the Kwara State and Federal parastatals among others. She will soon be charged to court upon conclusion of the ongoing investigation.

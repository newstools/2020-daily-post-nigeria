Southampton manager, Ralph Hasenhuttl, has told Premier League referees to be “brave” when they officiate at Anfield. Hasenhuttl feels his side should have had a “clear penalty” during their 4-0 defeat to Liverpool on Saturday. Saints striker, Danny Ings, went down under a Fabinho challenge in the box, but referee Kevin Friend waved play on and the Reds took the lead through Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain moments later. “You need brave decisions from the referee. To say ‘no goal and penalty’, here at Anfield, that won’t happen. “In the first half there was a backpass to the Liverpool goalkeeper [not given], that’s another decision, maybe this is why it’s so difficult to win here. “It is a clear penalty and in such moments the game can turn in our direction. “Maybe the result is a little high but I would like to watch this game if we went one goal up,” Hasenhuttl told the media after the game.

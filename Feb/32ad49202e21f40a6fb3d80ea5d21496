Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has provided the latest injury update on Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford and Lee Grant ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Chelsea. Man United will take on Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on February 17 after playing goalless against Wolves in their last Premier League encounter. Solskjaer says Pogba, Rashford and Grant are not ready to join the Red Devils’ training ahead of their clash against Frank Lampard’s side. Rashford, Pogba and Grant were even excluded from Man United’s squad to travel to Spain for their winter break warm up training on Saturday as the trio continues their recovery from injuries. “Marcus Rashford and Paul Pogba are not ready yet to join in the team’s training ahead of Chelsea clash,” Solskjaer told MUTV on Saturday. “Lee Grant unluckily has had an injury that require surgery. “So will be out for two or three months, so hopefully he’ll get back before the end of the season.”

The Caucus of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the House of Representatives, Wednesday, backed calls by the party’s hierarchy for the review of the Supreme Court judgements on the presidential election and four governorship polls. Caucus Leader, Rep. Kingsley Chinda made the position known in a statement to newsmen in Abuja. Apart from the presidential election, the House caucus wants the apex court to revisit the governorship elections of Kaduna, Katsina, Kano and Osun states. Declaring support for the party’s demand, the caucus said it predicated its action on the request by the All Progressives Congress (APC) asking the Supreme Court to review its judgement on the Bayelsa governorship election. In his words, “We take cognizance of the fact that some Supreme Court justices and indeed, other judges, as well as judicial officers have in the past suffered assaults, both formally and informally under the supervision of the General Muhammadu Buhari administration. “Cognizant of the fact the Supreme Court infallibility is hinged on its finality, and not because it’s personnel (justices) are infallible, we reaffirm our faith and confidence in the judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court which is still the only hope of the common man. “Consequently, we express our unalloyed support for the leadership of our great party, the PDP, and hereby call for a review by the Supreme Court of all its earlier judgements”.

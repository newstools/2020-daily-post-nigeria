Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has admitted he misses Pep Guardiola. Arteta worked as Guardiola’s assistant at Manchester City for three years, before he replaced Unai Emery at the Emirates in December. The Gunners are currently in 10th place in the Premier League, while City have fallen 22 points behind leaders Liverpool. Arteta, who is currently with the Arsenal squad in Dubai, says he is still in contact with Guardiola and was “privileged” to have learned from him as a manager. When asked by reporters whether he missed Guardiola, Arteta said: “Absolutely. I am a big friend of his and I admire him. I had a lot of joy working together and success. We spent a lot of time together and he is a friend. “I always talk with him. He is a really good friend of mine. I respect him so much. We share a lot of things in our life and we discuss everything. “I have to apply my own things. He was part of my development as a person to go through a lot of things I experienced next to him. “It was a privilege and of course a lot of the things I took on board, that I felt from my time at Barcelona, we shared together and a lot of things I learned from his management.”

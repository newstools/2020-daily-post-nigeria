Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, could be fined by the Premier League, after he did not emerge from the dressing room for 45 minutes, following their 2-0 defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, according to the Manchester Evening News. Debutant Steven Bergwijn and Heung-Min Son scored in the second half, to secure all three points for Jose Mourinho’s side. However, the goals came after Hugo Lloris saved Ilkay Gundogan’s penalty and Oleksandr Zinchenko was sent off for two bookable offences. The loss means the champions are now 22 points behind runaway leaders, Liverpool. When Guardiola eventually emerged to face the media, he denied that he kept his players back to criticize their performance. “Never. With this performance? How should I be critical after this performance? “I was talking to my staff and my wife. After this performance it would be an incredible mistake to say how bad they are. We created chances and conceded few,” the Spaniard said.

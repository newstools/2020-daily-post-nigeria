Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy has directed the Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, to block the SIM cards that are registered but not updated with the NIN before December 1, 2020. According to the Minister, this will ensure that the maximum number of sim cards owned by a Nigerian would not be above three. Pantami issued the directive in a statement signed and released by his Technical Assistant, Dr Femi Adeluyi, on Wednesday, directing the NCC to revise the Policy on sim card registration and usage. He said, ”The revision of the Policy is based on the feedback received from the security agencies, following the successful re validation of improperly registered SIM cards in September 2019 and the blocking of those that failed to revalidate their Sims. ”The commission is directed to ensure that the National Identity Number, NIN, becomes a prerequisite for Nigerians registering new SIM cards, while for foreigners, their passports and visas should be used. ”SIM cards that are already registered are to be updated with the NIN before December 1, 2020. “There should be a maximum number of SIM cards that can be tied to a single individual, possibly a maximum of 3. ”The commission should also ensure that subscribers can easily check the number of SIM cards registered to their name, along with the associated phone numbers and networks and that no unregistered Sims are ever allowed on mobile networks.” The Minister also stated that SIM cards which have been used to perpetrate crimes should be permanently deactivated.
Pantami also gave the directive that the NCC should provide progress reports on the implementation of the revised policy.

Former Osun governor, Olagunsoye Oyinlola says indiscipline started the crisis in the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP). A statement by Taiwo Adisa, the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, quoted Oyinlola as making the declaration on Tuesday. Makinde and some national officers of PDP visited Oyinlola in his country home in Okuku as he marked his 69th birthday. Oyinlola expressed sadness that the PDP crisis started with him. He recalled that he was duly elected as national secretary of PDP but removed overnight. According to him, the major squabble was when seven governors joined forces and decided that they would leave the party. ”The movement was to serve as a scare-crow, we wanted to give them the fear so that they would call everybody to discuss the problem and settle it amicably”, he noted. Oyinlola disclosed that the sentiment came from the leader (reference to President Goodluck Jonathan), who said “the agitating governors had no electoral value”. “Having said that seven serving governors lacked electoral value was the height of arrogance and lack of belief in the Lord,” he said. The former governor, however, stated that whatever he had achieved as a politician was on the records of the PDP. Oyinlola said he was overwhelmed by the display of cordiality extended to him by Governor Makinde and the PDP national officers. He announced that whenever he was ready to make a decision on his next political move, such would be made public. To Makinde and other visitors, Oyinlola thanked them for taking out time to be with him. The retired Brigadier General told the delegation that “it takes a Christian mind of yours to remember that there is somebody somewhere who was part of you and feel you should celebrate on a day like this.” Oyinlola further suggested that he had been abandoned by people formerly close to him. ”We had an association with many other people but it never occurred to them,” Oyinlola added.

Investigation has proved that some women in Gombe State boil used sanitary pads and drink it to get high. Gombe State command of the Nigeria Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA, disclosed this during a sensitization program in Bajoga area of the state. The commander in charge of the Funakaye command of the agency, Muhammad Alkali, said the sensitisation campaign was to enlighten the people on the fight against illicit drugs abuse. Lamenting, Alkali urged the society to help the agency in the fight against the use of illicit drugs. She said “It has come to our notice that mostly female addicts have devised means of getting high without consuming constitutionally known substances.” “Nowadays, they now boil used sanitary pads mixed with other substance mostly waste then filter the water before drinking. “This is very bad for humans, our society really needs the help of all and sundry in this fight as NDLEA cannot do it alone,” Alkali lamented.

Borno State Governor, Professor Babagana Umara Zulum has visited the scene of attack at Auno along the Maiduguri – Damaturu road where 30 people were killed and 18 vehicles destroyed by Boko Haram militants who stormed the area at about 9:50pm on Sunday. The military authority and the Police is yet to make statement to the effect. However, those who followed the governor and other security sources confirmed that aside the 30 people that were killed in the attack, the insurgents abducted passengers in three buses. Residents of the area told the governor that, when the insurgents stormed the area and started shooting, they all fled to the bushes only to return home this morning (Monday) to witness such a devastation by the Boko Haram militants. DAILY POST spoke with Alkali Ibrahim, a resident of Auno and learnt that, at the time of the attack, there was no military presence in the area except for vehicles who arrived late and met the unfortunate incident as they fall victim in the attack. An impeccable source in the Police told DAILY POST that the insurgents came with superior power and chase security operatives before carrying out their evil acts. ” Some of the passengers were burnt with the vehicles while others die of gun shot wounds,” The source said. Governor Zulum who was worried over the incident remained speechless at the destruction of lives and property as he was taken round. He, however, asked members of the civilian JTF, and hunters to remain vigilant and work with the military and police to ensure that such incident does not occur again.

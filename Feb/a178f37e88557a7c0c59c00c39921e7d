Anambra State governor, Willie Obiano, has directed that 50 youths, consisting of male and female be selected from all the 179 communities in the state for special police training, in preparation for recruitment. Obiano speaking in a meeting with critical stakeholders in the security sectors in Awka, directed that the process of selecting youths to be recruited as special constables be kick-started without delay. He said, “Every crime is local. Every community must own their security. Traditional rulers, Presidents General, Youth Leaders, women leaders, vigilante leaders, Divisional Police Officers and other critical stakeholders must be part of the selection team, and will meet twice a month to discuss security as it affects their communities. “Each community has one month to forward the names of the individuals who will be trained and appointed Special Constables with uniforms,” he said. The governor made it clear that the individuals must be people of impeccable character, calling on stakeholders to join hands to make the process work, as security is very paramount. The State Commissioner of Police, CP John Abang who was also in the meeting extolled the security architecture existing in the State. He said this has boosted a robust collaboration among the security agencies and added that Anambra’s proactive security arrangement is a model to be copied. Earlier, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Creative Security, Retired Air Vice Marshal Ben Chiobi stressed that the primary responsibility of government is security, noting that a lot of new thinking on security is going on in the country, as the meeting affords an opportunity to rub minds on the new thinking as well as the way forward. The meeting was attended by all heads of security agencies in the state, lawmakers, traditional rulers, presidents general of communities, market leaders and many other groups.

Justice Mohammed Mohammed of the Sokoto State High Court on Thursday, sentenced one Wakili Yusuf Oladapo to three years imprisonment for scamming two prospective National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), members to the tune of N120,000. He was prosecuted on amended one-count charge of obtaining by false pretence by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. Oladapo had defrauded the individuals after deceiving them to part with N60,000 each, on the false promise to help them secure deployment to their choice states. The petitioner explained that they met the convict through the Whatsapp group of a school, where he advertised that he could get interested persons posted to states they prefer. The one-count charges reads: “That you Wakili Yusuf Oladapo between the 13th and 24th day of September, 2019 in Sokoto within the Juridical Division of the High Court of Justice of Sokoto State, with intent to defraud, did obtain a total sum of N120,000.00 from Aladetan Michael Olubodunrin, whom you falsely represented yourself to him as being a staff of NYSC, who could have him redeployed to a state of his choice, a pretence you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 310 of the Sokoto State Penal Code Law, 2019 and Punishable under Section 311 of the same Law.” After Oladapo pleaded guilty to the charge, prosecution counsel, Buhari Mohammed Balarabe, requested his sentencing in line with the extant laws. Defence counsel, Shamsu A. Dauda pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy as his client was a first time offender who has become remorseful. In convicting and sentencing the defendant, Justice Mohammed gave Oladapo a N30,000 option of fine and ordered that he made full restitution to his victims.

Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have reacted to the Supreme Court ruling that sacked Bayelsa State governor-elect, David Lyon on Thursday. The court had also declared Senator Douye Diri of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, winner of the polls. The PDP Governors’ Forum congratulated Diri and his running mate, Sen. Lawrence Ewhruojakpo. The congratulatory message was signed and made available to journalists by the Director-General of the Forum, Hon. C.I.D. Maduabum, in Abuja on Thursday. The Forum said the declaration by the apex court reaffirmed the fact that “God is in charge of the affairs of men.” “It shows that the truth and the people’s will ultimately triumph. This is a great victory for democracy and rule of law,” he said. The governors welcomed Diri to their forum, and “prayed to God to give him the wisdom and strength to steer the ship of Bayelsa aright. “We implore you to carry everyone along and run an inclusive government worthy of the ideals of the PDP Governors’ family.”

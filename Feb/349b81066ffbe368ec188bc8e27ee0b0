Everyone you think is the best knows I’m the best since Fela Kuti. “But Timaya told me something a long time ago that made me not care about being the best. “The World can do without the Best” the world will still spin regardless. “The same people that wish you the best to your face are the same people that hope and pray you Fail so that they can feel better about themselves. That’s just Life. “That’s why complements mean nothing to me because hate, Jealousy are sugar coated by them “NOBODY paved shit for me. Everybody dey find them own.

Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has drawn up a list of four defenders, as he seeks to resolve his side’s issues, the UK Times reports. They include: Villarreal’s Pau Torres, Benfica’s Ruben Dias, Brighton’s Lewis Dunk and Inter’s Milan Skriniar. City are currently 22 points behind leaders Liverpool in the Premier League. Guardiola has all but given up on winning the title for a third consecutive league, following a dismal campaign. The champions have been affected by Vincent Kompany’s departure and Aymeric Laporte’s injury. Guardiola will enter the transfer market at the end of the season for two central defenders and John Stones will be pushed out. Stones has struggled to step up in Laporte’s absence and has lost his place to midfielder Fernadinho. City have spent more than £300million on defenders since Guardiola arrived in 2016.

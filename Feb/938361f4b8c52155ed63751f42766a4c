Two members of the House of Representatives, Rep. Paschal Obi and Rep. Kingsley Chima have given reasons for defecting from Action Alliance (AA) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) Obi speaking to journalists on Thursday in Abuja after announcing their defection on the floor of the House said he had to defect to APC due to crisis in the party. ”I have been representing my people until now that I took the decision after due consultation with my constituents; that is the people of Ideato-North/Ideato-South. “We decided that I defect to the APC because of the very persistent crisis and rivalry in the AA. “A lot of litigation and factions created. So, I had no other option than to take this decision, the decision I have consummated today on the floor of the house. “So, I am now a member of the APC and no more AA,” he said. On his part, Chima said that though he ran election under the platform of AA, he collaborated with the APC to win the contest. He added that he discovered that AA had engrossed itself with a lot of litigation and leadership crisis, NAN reports. Meanwhile, the National Organising Secretary of the APC, Mr Emmenuel Ibediro, has congratulated the lawmakers for returning to the party. He described the defection as “harvest of goodwill” that the party had created not just in Imo but in Nigeria. “Joining our party today is an endorsement of the good things the party is doing; the good things the president is doing and it shows the tacit support for the politics of the APC. “I’m happy today that our party has been made richer by the entrance of these two powerful honourable members from my state,” he said.

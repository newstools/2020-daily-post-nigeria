Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, on Saturday, blamed President Muhammadu Buhari and those who voted him for the visa ban imposed on Nigeria by the United States, U.S. DAILY POST had reported that the US President, Donald Trump had imposed a visa ban on Nigeria and five other countries. The US president had signed the proclamation on Friday and it’s expected to take effect on February 22. Reacting to the ban, Omokri stated that federal government’s release of some Boko Haram members played a major role in the sanction. In a post on his Facebook page, the former presidential aide also stated that the launching of Operation Python Dance in the Southeast, Operation Crocodile Smile in the South-South and Southwest was responsible for the ban. He wrote: “I wish the US did not place Nigeria on the Travel Ban list but put yourself in Trump’s shoes. Under this administration, Nigeria has released thousands of ‘repentant’ Boko Haram members, any of whom could apply for and get a US visa and wreak havoc. “They watch as this government unleashed operation Python Dance on the Southeast, Operation Crocodile Smile on the SouthSouth and Southwest, while they treat herdsmen with kid gloves. “Any of those herdsmen can apply for and obtain a US visa and export their marauding activities to America. Let us be logical, not sentimental. Don’t blame Trump. Blame General Buhari. In fact, blame yourself for electing him!”

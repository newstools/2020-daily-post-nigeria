Former Lagos State governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Jimi Agbaje, has said that “formal operators that have thus far regulated themselves should be allowed to continue”. This comes amid the ban on the operations of commercial motorcycles and tricycles in six local government areas and nine local council development. The ban took effect from Saturday, February 1. Agbaje tweeted on Monday that: “A Lagos state for the 21st century needs proper planning. The reasons for the ban on commercial motorcycles (Okada) and motor tricycles (Keke Marwa) by the Lagos State Government are noted. But what about the people? “My view is that such outright ban on major routes will be counterproductive and difficult to enforce. “It will also have negative ripple effects on the economy with so many already out of work and cause inconvenience to commuters. “The formal operators that have thus far regulated themselves should be allowed to continue, with stringent regulation and enforcement of traffic laws.” The Lagos State Government has said that it plans to roll out alternatives to provide commuters with options.

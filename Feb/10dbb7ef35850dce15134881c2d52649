Barcelona’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, has confirmed that the club is interested in signing Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Aubameyang was heavily linked with the LaLiga giants in the January window, but ended up staying with the Gunners. The Gabon striker turns 31 in the summer and is desperate to play Champions League football again, something Arsenal might not be able to offer him next season. Barca have lost Luis Suarez to a knee problem and are already planning for life without the Uruguay international. “It is logical that in summer a ‘9’ will come. It is a necessity. We know that [Luis] Suarez will come back strong, but you have to bring a top player in the summer. “We do not know if he will be young or experienced. We only look at the talent and adaptation they may have. We must think that some top players have come and have not adapted well,” Abidal told Sport. He also admitted that Aubameyang was on Barca’s radar, refusing to rule out a move for the former Borussia Dortmund man. “I know him (Aubameyang). He has a profile that has depth. He is important, and in his team he is decisive. “It is good to bring this profile of player who can be in the market and can help you. We’ll see what will happen,” he added. Aubameyang, who recently served a three-match ban in the Premier League, has always insisted he is happy at Arsenal. However, he will have just one year left on his current contract at the end of this season. The Gunners might be forced to sell if he does not agree to fresh terms.

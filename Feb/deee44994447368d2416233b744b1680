He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for formation of a criminal gang, conspiracy to murder, and conspiracy against the established government and the president. Mihigo was granted a presidential pardon by Kagame in 2018 but was was rearrested last week when crossing the border into Burundi. Authorities explained that this was a breach of the conditions of his pardon. “He had been in a police cell for three days as police investigated why he was crossing the border illegally and cases of bribery”, Police spokesperson Eric Kabera said in the statement. It added that Mihigo was allowed to meet family members and his lawyer. However, it is unclear whether he was held in solitary confinement.

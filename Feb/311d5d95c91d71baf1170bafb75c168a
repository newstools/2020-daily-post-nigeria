A Federal High Court, sitting in Abuja, Wednesday, ordered the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, the Nigeria Police, NPF, and the Department of State Service, DSS, to arrest the purveyors of a published story of conspiracy allegedly orchestrated to jail Senator Gabriel Suswan. DAILY POST learnt that those named in the alleged plot to jail Suswan are the trial Judge, Justice Okon Abang, EFCC prosecution counsel, Rotimi Jacob and unnamed APC stakeholders. It was also gathered that the contentious publication disclosed that thirty minutes after the court proceedings last Friday, Abang drove to Nnamidi Azikwe International Airport with the EFCC prosecutor, Rotimi Jacobs where the duo flew to Lagos and had a secret meeting with some APC stakeholders. DAILY POST also recalls that former Governor Suswam, alongside his erstwhile Commissioner for Finance, Okolobia Okpanachi, are under EFCC prosecution over alleged money laundering and diversion of N3.1 billion belonging to the Benue State government. But as the court resumed hearing today, Justice Abang ordered the anti-graft agency and the security agencies to jointly investigate the report and unveil its sponsors. EFCC acting spokesman, Tony Orilade said this in a statement in Abuja. Orilade also said the court ordered that the joint committee should submit its findings to the registrar of the court and copies served on counsels representing parties within 21 days from today. Further, Abang reportedly affirmed that he considered the publication a serious issue of national interest, saying, “Upon receipt, the court shall make further consequential order on the matter.”

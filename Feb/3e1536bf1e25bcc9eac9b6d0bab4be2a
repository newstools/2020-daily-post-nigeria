Saudi Arabia has announced the suspension of visas to pilgrims, who want to perform Umrah (lesser Hajj), due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. The country’s foreign ministry revealed this on Thursday via a tweet. It explained that Saudi Arabia was “suspending entry to the Kingdom for the purpose of Umrah and visiting the Prophet’s Mosque temporarily.” The ministry also said it has suspended the issuance of tourist visas to residents of countries where the virus is a “danger”. The statement added that Saudi Arabia was “suspending entry into the Kingdom with tourist visas for those coming from countries in which the spread of the new Coronavirus (COVlD-19) is a danger, according to the criteria determined by the competent health authorities in the Kingdom.” Umrah is a pilgrimage performed by Muslims at any time of the year.

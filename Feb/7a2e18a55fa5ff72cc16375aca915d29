Barcelona’s sporting director, Eric Abidal has said that there was no offer for the club’s legend, Xavi, to become the Catalan manager at Camp Nou. DAILY POST had reported that Xavi, who is currently the coach of Al-Sadd, was widely expected to replace Ernesto Valverde last month. Still, Barcelona opted to appoint Quique Setien as their new manager. Speaking in an interview with Sport, Abidal said: “There was no offer for Xavi to become Barcelona manager. If he’s got one, let him show it because I have not seen it. “In the first meeting we had with Xavi, he listened, and in the second meeting, he told us his plan. “And what came out in the media was more of a political than sport. “I do not do politics. I only talk about football. “What interests me is the way a coach works, and a lot of issues came up apart from what we discussed with him. “Barcelona bet on Quique Setien for two years, and we believe in him more. “The door is always open for Xavi to become Barcelona coach. I do not know if I will be in Barcelona, but Barcelona always has the door open.”

Boko Haram insurgents on Friday evening entered Garkida, a town in Gombi, a local government area north of Adamawa State, and went on rampage. The insurgents were said to have destroyed lives and properties,l. Sources said the insurgents arrived from somewhere in neighbouring Borno State into Garkida about 7pm, causing residents to scamper for safety, with unspecified number of them being fatally harmed or at least injured. The state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje told DAILY POST that personnel had been drafted to ascertain the situation. “It has come to us that there is an attack in Garkida and we’ve mobilised personnel, but they are yet to get back to us,” Nguroje said over the phone. Nguroje, who spoke about 10.15 pm Friday, said he believed his men were about arriving Garkida, and that he would speak when he gets dependable feedback from the detachment to the area. “Right now, what I know is little more than what I hear or read in the social media, but most of the social media stuff are untrue. I will get back to you with the facts when I know them,” he said. Although, Gombi was one of the seven Adamawa LGAs once seized by Boko Haram, the insurgents had more recently concentrated their activities on Madagali and Michika, so the Gombi attack is a rather new one in recent times.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said Harry Kane is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a hamstring injury. Mourinho, speaking at a press conference on Friday, claimed Kane could play as many as five Premier League games this season. Kane limped off during Spurs’ 1-0 defeat to Southampton on New Year’s Day, with manager Mourinho initially saying that he could be ruled out until the end of the season. However, the England striker has shown positive signs during his recovery and Mourinho has said that he could return earlier. “[He is] a little bit ahead of schedule. “[He] gives me a little bit of hope that instead of [returning for] one or two matches, he could be three, four or five. “I’m speculating a little bit. He is feeling good. Everything is going well. Every time he has a little problem, he is the kind of guy that doesn’t accept protocol,” Mourinho said.

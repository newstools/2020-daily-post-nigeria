Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State has suspended the Vice Chancellor of Kogi state University, Prof Abdulkadir and the Rector of the State Polytechnic, Prof Mohammed Atureta for non compliance with the Treasury Single Account policy of the State Government. DAILY POST had on Sunday reported that, the Chief Medical Director of the Kogi state specialist hospital, Lokoja Dr Ahmed Attah, was also suspended for the same purpose. The state Commissioner for information and Communication, Kingsley Fanwo confirmed the suspension to our correspondent on Monday evening. The commissioner noted that the Treasury Single Account policy was introduced based on the need to harness every penny accruing to the state to enable it fulfill her financial obligations to the people. “For some time now, there have been circular directing all agencies departments and parastatals to operate under TSA but for inexplicable reason they have failed to heed this directive. “Government is determined to rake in more revenue and block loopholes in order to deliver in the promises we made to our people to do more than we did in the first term. “Moreso, we have set machinery in motion to work out the modalities for the implementation of the new national Minimum Wage. To achieve all these, we need all the legitimate revenue we can get. “TSA is a policy that helps to check corruption in the System. Our administration is in support of any policy that promotes corruption and accountability. “The suspension of the affected officials will send a strong signal to others that this administration means business in the implementation of the TSA Policy,” he stated. He called on top management of agencies and ministries to fully comply with the new financial guidelines, warning that anyone found wanting, would not be shielded.

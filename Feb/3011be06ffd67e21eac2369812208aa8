The Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has expressed confidence in the leadership of Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo. PACAC Chairman, Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN), said this on Friday when he led a delegation to the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Sagay, noted that the administration has recorded significant achievements in its fight against corruption. Sagay said, “We want to assure you of our confidence in your leadership, not only in the supervision of PACAC, but as a leader in this country. “We also want to assure you that we have noted with pleasure your sterling performance as Vice President, and we regard you as a very successful co-pilot with President Muhammadu Buhari in steering the ship of this nation. “We have absolute confidence in your leadership and will continue to associate with you and will look for your supervision and leadership role in what we are doing.” The PACAC Chairman noted that a data and information synergy with the anti-corruption agencies would help to further highlight the efforts of this administration in its anti-corruption drive. In his remarks, Osinabjo said government will ensure that there is better synergy among anti-corruption agencies and other government agencies so as to push out the correct narratives on the fight against corruption. “Nigerians are definitely familiar with the anti-corruption drive of this administration,” the VP noted while stating that efforts to enlighten the public within Nigeria and beyond would be ramped up significantly.

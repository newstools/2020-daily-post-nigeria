All you need is to approach your bank and tell them the kind of car you need. After checking your credit report and If they see that your credit report is good then you qualify to pick any of your choice car from any Dealer and also your insurance company will then work it out with your bank while you get placed on mortgage for five years, even if the car gets involved in an accident in the process they will collect it from you and give you another brand new car. These are cars that, AWOOF CAR AUCTION COMPANY will always recommend for Prospective Clients. The car that have CLEAN TITLE AND SALVAGE TITLE is better than the car with FLOOD CERTIFICATE OF TITLE (DON’T GO THERE). Any car, we bring from United State of America cannot be compared to what you will buy here in Nigeria. We will always advise on the accident car that is minor and it must be from the back and not from the front because of the Engine. It is time for you to decide and walk into our office to make more clarification from our customer service representative or we can begin the process without necessarily coming as we can always deliver. However, we will advise the client to allow us to confirm the clearance cost of their vehicle before buying as we realized that the cost of clearance is the issue here in Nigeria since they have closed border. It will be advisable for you to reduce the year of the car that you are planning to buy to cater for the cost of clearing because the higher the car, the higher the cost of clearance. It means the amount for 2005 Toyota Corolla is different from Toyota Corolla 2010 but it is possible to buy a Toyota Corolla 2010 for the same price of Toyota Corolla 2005 at the auction because, in auction, the bidding and cost of buying depends on the interest of the bidder. If nobody likes Toyota Corolla 2010 that we are bidding on at the live auction, then, it means we will be the only bidder and you will be amazed to see that we can get the same Toyota Corolla 2010 as cheap as the cost of Toyota Corolla 2005. Auction process is LUCK and that is why we do advise that the client should let us lookout for a car that is relatively minor accident at the back. Maybe the bumper is removed or the door is not there. Don’t worry it will be fixed and you will never believe when you see it on delivery, this allows the customer to get it cheap as the dealer in the United State of America. We mean US resident doesn’t like to bid on any car that has damaged or severed damaged at all, because it is really expensive to fix car in any developed country like United State. The good news is that we have part dealer partners in LADIPO Market and Owode here in Lagos where we can easily buy original parts and replace them. The only car that we can’t Buy is the one with damaged engine or deflated airbag (DEATH SENTENCE) God forbid an accident happens. We have many reliable auto care shop that specializes in fixing any car that get involved in accident 100% as far as the accident is minor and it has to be from the back as they don’t fix engine and we don’t give advice for fixing engine at all.

Do you know that some cars in Nigeria don’t have airbags at all? And these are the cars that are cheapest in auction. You don’t have to keep thinking that a car is good because it looks shining due to its body shape but you also need to start thinking of the internal features of the car.

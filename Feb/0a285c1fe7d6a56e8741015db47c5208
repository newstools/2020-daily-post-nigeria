Real Madrid’s 4-1 win over Osasuna on Sunday, was Zinedine Zidane’s 88th in LaLiga. It takes him above Jose Mourinho, into third all-time for the most wins in the Spanish top flight as Madrid boss. Only Miguel Munoz and Vicente del Bosque have won more league games as manager at the Santiago Bernabeu. Madrid had to come from a goal down to win the game, after Unai Garcia gave the visitors an early lead. Isco and Sergio Ramos scored before half time, to turn the game on its head. Late goals from Lucas Vazquez and Luka Jovic sealed the points for Madrid, who moved six points clear of rivals Barcelona who are in second place. Barca face Real Betis later on Sunday night.

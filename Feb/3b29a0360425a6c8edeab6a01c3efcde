The Governor had earlier frowned at the lackadaisical attitude of some contractors handling the road projects in the state, stressing that the government cannot be held to ransom by contractors who are bent on sabotaging his efforts by abandoning contracts awarded to them by the previous government. Meanwhile, he has charged the committee to swing into action and report to the government any irregularities which may impede on the speed of the road projects, insisting that the work must get to a considerable extent before the rain sets in. Other members of the taskforce committee are Dr. E.C Egbuka, the Acting Permanent Secretary Ministry of Works as the secretary of the committee, Willie Okolie, Emeka Iheanacho, Fabian Ihekweme and Iyke Njoku.

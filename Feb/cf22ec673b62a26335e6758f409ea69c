President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday commended the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu for early implementation of the new minimum wage. Buhari said Akeredolu has been able to achieve such a feat despite the scarcity of resources. He spoke during the inauguration of the Ore Interchange Flyover on the Shagamu–Ore–Benin Expressway in Ondo State and was contained in a statement signed and sent to DAILY POST by his Media Aide, Femi Adesina. Commending the impactful performance of the current Ondo State administration, Buhari affirmed that the Akeredeolu administration had cleared six months out of the seven months arrears of salaries/pensions owed by the previous administration. He also lauded the state government for being up-to-date in the payment of salaries and pensions. According to Buhari: ”It is gratifying to note that Ondo State is one of the first few states in Nigeria that have started implementing the New Minimum Wage. ”You have been able to achieve these feats in spite of limited available resources. ”I am not surprised at this because available records show that Ondo State has recorded the highest percentage leap in Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) among the States, due to the effort of the APC government here. ” Recall that Buhari had last year approved the immediate implementation of the N30,000 new national wage for Federal Public Service workers currently earning below the minimum wage.

Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo of the Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos, has convicted and sentenced the duo of Chukwuma David Chinaka and Quincy Peter Patrick, to one year imprisonment each. The convicts were arraigned by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on a two-count charge bordering on transfer of criminal proceeds to a nominee to the tune of $997,400 USD, contrary to the Criminal Code Law of Lagos State, 2011. Count one reads: “That you, Chukwuma David Chinaka, Quincy Peter Patrick, Emeka Clinton Ezenwa (still at large) and Chikezie Okoro ( still at large) sometime in 2017, in Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, retained in your control, the aggregate sum of $997,400 USD being proceeds of criminal conduct on behalf of Chukwuma David Chinaka and others at large.” Count two reads: “That you, Chukwuma David Chinaka, Quincy Peter Patrick, Emeka Clinton Ezenwa (still at large) and Chikezie Okoro (still at large), sometime in 2018, in Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, retained in your control the aggregate sum of $281,600 USD being proceeds of criminal conduct on behalf of Emeka Clinton Ezenwa and others at large.” The defendants pleaded “guilty” to the charges preferred against them by the prosecution. The prosecution counsel, S.O. Daji, prayed the court to convict and sentence the defendants accordingly. Justice Taiwo convicted and sentenced the defendants to one year in prison each, with an option of N350,000. He ordered that a plot of land located in Guzape, Abuja, a four-bedroom massionaette located in Brains and Hammers Estate, Galadimawa, Abuja as well as the sum of $107,850 recovered from the convicts be forfeited to the Federal Government to restitute the victim through the Federal Bureau of Investigations, FBI.

The Democrats in the United States of America Senate are approaching defeat in their move to impeach President Donald Trump. The lawmakers were served a significant blow as the President’s impeachment trial continue after a key Republican senator, Lamar Alexander said he would vote against calling new witnesses. After hours of questions, Alexander, who is seen as a key holdout, declared on social media that he would oppose calling new witnesses. The lawmaker tweeted, “I worked with other senators to make sure that we have the right to ask for more documents and witnesses, but there is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the U.S. Constitution’s high bar for an impeachable offense. “There is no need for more evidence to conclude that the president withheld United States aid, at least in part, to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens; the House managers have proved this with what they call a ‘mountain of overwhelming evidence.'” This development meant that the Democrats could now hope for a possible tie on the question of witnesses a situation that would likely lead to a defeat. The Democrats had in December impeached President Trump in the House of Representatives. The President was impeached on grounds of abusing his power for pressuring Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. They also charged the President with obstruction of Congress. Trump’s fate now lies in the Senate and his impeachment trial has lasted for a week now. Two-thirds of the Senate is required to remove the President from office, according to the US constitution. However, Trump is unlikely to be convicted simply because the ruling Republicans hold a 53-47 majority of the US Senate.

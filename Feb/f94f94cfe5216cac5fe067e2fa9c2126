Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has claimed Borussia Dortmund have only “one special player” in their squad and that is winger, Jason Sancho. The Brazil international also described Sancho as a very good player that he truly like to watch. Neymar said this ahead of PSG’s UEFA Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie against Dortmund on Tuesday night. “Dortmund is a club with lots of quality players,” Neymar told Sky Sports. “But they have only one special player, who joined the club recently and is name is Sancho. “The Bundesliga giants also have other good players but Sancho is the one player I like to watch player because he is an excellent player with a lot of quality. Neymar added: “Our match against them on Tuesday in the Champions League would be tough at their home but we will do our best to come out with a good result at the end of the game to take back to Paris.” Sancho has been impressive for Dortmund since joining the club from Manchester City in 2017.

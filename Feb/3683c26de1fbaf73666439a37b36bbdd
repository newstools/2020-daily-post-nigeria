Liverpool have been given “no guarantees” they will be awarded the Premier League title, if the coronavirus crisis means the season ends prematurely, the UK Telegraph reports. This comes amid fears over the rapid spread of the virus in the UK and around the globe. As well as Jurgen Klopp’s men are not being assured of the title, it would also mean the bottom three clubs may escape relegation. Liverpool currently sit 22 points clear at the top and are looking to win the title for the first time in the modern era. Although there is no reported incident in the Premier League, Newcastle have already ordered their players not to shake hands in training. UEFA too have expressed doubts over Euro 2020, which is scheduled to be held in several cities across the continent.

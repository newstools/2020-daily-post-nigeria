Former Manchester United assistant coach, Steve McClaren, has advised the club’s manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, on the best position to play forward, Anthony Martial, at Old Trafford. McClaren says Martial is good at playing from the left-side of the attack line where all his best goals have come from this season. According to him, the France international is not a striker. “Martial isn’t a number 9 because all his best goals this season has come from the left-side of the attack line,” McClaren told Sky Sports. “He plays mainly from the left-side in the attack. “Martial, on his own, can’t play as a striker.” Martial will hope to lead Man United to victory when they take on Chelsea on Monday in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge.

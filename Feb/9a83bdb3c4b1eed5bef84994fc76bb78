The Speaker of the Lagos House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, has declared that the new security outfit, Operation Amotekun, has come to stay in the state and the South West. The lawmaker stated this on Monday at a public hearing on a bill to establish the security operation in Lagos state. According to Obasa, the outfit had become important for the security of the lives and properties of the people of the region. “I’m sure we all recall the incidents before the establishment of Amotekun, the killings, maiming, kidnapping and their likes. “In the wisdom of our governors, they decided on Amotekun,” Obasa said. Obasa pointed to the fact that the idea had stirred different reactions around the country but insisted the South West cannot relent in the zone’s bid to ensure people are safe. The Speaker recalled that the Neighbourhood Watch was established in Lagos in 2016 and now other states have queued into the idea thus making it important for it to be amended to accommodate Amotekun. Obasa further explained that the bill on Amotekun would be accommodated in the existing law, adding that “Amotekun has come to stay and we must stand by it.” He disclosed that Amotekun has been supported by over 40 million Yoruba people and, as a result, it would only be wise to favour the bill. “Our race has spoken and we must stand by it but in line with the constitution,” he said. In an opening remark, Hon. Tunde Braimoh, chairman of the committee on Information and security, said the protection of lives and property was the most important responsibility of government as stipulated in the constitution.

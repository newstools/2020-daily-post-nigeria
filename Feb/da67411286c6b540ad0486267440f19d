An early morning inferno on Tuesday razed part of Atakumosa Central Market, located in Adeti area of Ilesha, in Osun State, destroying goods worth millions of naira. The fire reportedly started around 1am and affected several shops located at the entrance of the market before it was put out by firemen with the assistance of policemen. The Administrative Officer of Osun State Fire Service, Fatai Aremu said that despite early response to the distress call, barriers at the entrance of the affected shops did not allow the firemen access. He added that the damage caused by the fire incident was severe, as he claimed that the cause of the incident had not been ascertained. The spokesperson for Osun State Police Command, Folasade Odoro, in her reaction explained that the command promptly deployed police men to the scene of the incident to prevent hoodlums from taking advantage of the inferno to loot, adding that no life was lost. She, however, said that the command was yet to ascertain the cause of the fire.

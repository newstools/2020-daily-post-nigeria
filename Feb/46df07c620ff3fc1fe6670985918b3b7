Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Tuesday met with President Muhammadu Buhari. Akeredolu said the meeting with Buhari was not to discuss Amotekun, a South West security outfit. Akeredolu, speaking to State House correspondents at the end of the closed-door meeting with the president at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, said he met with the president to invite him for inauguration of some projects executed by his administration. The governor said he was in the Presidential Villa to invite Buhari to inaugurate a N5 billion flyover constructed by the state government. He said: “As you all know, I’ll be three years in office on the Feb. 24 and activities lined up in celebration of our third year in office include the inauguration of many of the projects which we have concluded. “And that is why I have come to see the President and to personally invite him to inaugurate our iconic flyover that we have in Ore, which Ondo State built over a federal road because we have enough carnage at that spot in Ore. “The flyover cost us over N5 billion. It is an important project to us.” Akeredolu insisted that the meeting with Buhari had no discussions about Amotekun. “That is probably why I had to brief you journalists because as I was coming here, I read in one of our papers that I was coming in here to discuss about ‘Amotekun’ with the President. I did not discuss that with him in anyway. We didn’t even mention it. He wouldn’t have asked me because I was not here for that purpose. “Issue of ‘Amotekun,’ is something to do with security and the Vice President has come into the matter; we have held a meeting and we are having subsequent meetings on Feb. 6. “The Governors of states in the South-West will meet with the Inspector-General of Police to sort a few things out and smoothen edges.”

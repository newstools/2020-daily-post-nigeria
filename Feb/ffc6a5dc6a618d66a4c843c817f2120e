The Arewa Consultative Forum, ACF, has declared that no true Muslim would desecrate Islam by killing to satisfy God. ACF Secretary-General, Anthony Sani made the remark in response to President Muhammadu Buhari’s recent remark that 90 per cent of Boko Haram victims are Muslims and not Christians. In an exclusive chat with DAILY POST, Sani said Boko Haram was a common enemy of Nigerians and should be dealt with for the good of the country. He said: “I do not have the exact figures as to how many Nigerians have been killed by the insurgence by religion but it is a known fact that most of Boko Haram sects are not only Muslims but are also people from North East. “The same with their victims most of whom are Muslims and from North East. But I cannot know the exact proportion.” Sani corroborated Buhari’s claim, stressing that Boko Haram was after what he termed “Mundane things like political power.” The ACF scribe noted that the terrorist group resort to religion is for strategic reasons. He said: “The sects do not target only Christians but also Muslims whom they consider are not willing to adhere to their version of Islam, even though we all know Boko Haram is not pursuing any jihad but is in search of mundane things like political power. “Their resort to religion is for strategic reasons and not pity meant to attract the gullible as canon fodders. “That was why President Obama once made a clear distinction between Islam and Islamic terrorism which desecrates Islam. No true Muslim can desecrate Islam by killing people for God Who does not need anybody to kill for Him. “I want to believe Boko Haram is a common enemy to all Nigerians who should come together and unleash their synergistic potential against collective challenge for the good of all Nigerians regardless of creed and ethnicity.”

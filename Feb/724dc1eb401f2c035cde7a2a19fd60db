Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski, has said he almost moved to Manchester United, after speaking with Sir Alex Ferguson. Lewandowski, who was 23 at the time, had just scored 30 goals in all competitions for Borussia Dortmund. The Poland international, now 31, admits he was tempted by the offer, but Dortmund refused to do business. “I was speaking with him [Ferguson] after two years at Dortmund and at that time I was really thinking about a move to Manchester United,” Lewandowski told the Guardian. “Because of Ferguson and because of Manchester United. “Borussia Dortmund said: ‘No, that’s that.’ That was the first time I was thinking about the move because if you get a phone call from Sir Alex Ferguson, for a young player it was something amazing. That was a special day for me.” Lewandowski eventually moved to Bayern two years later.

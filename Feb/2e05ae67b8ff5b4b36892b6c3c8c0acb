The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Appeal Courtâ€™s judgement of July 14, 2017 in which Ngene Linus Chibuike was convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, prosecuted the convict on a one-count charge of falsely declaring the sum of $11,500 instead of $2,506,998 to the officers of Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) as required under the provision of Section 2(5) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act 2011 (as amended by Act No. 1 of 2012). The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge, but the trial judge, Justice I.N Buba of the Federal High Court, Lagos on February 9, 2016, found him guilty. He sentenced Linus Chibuike to two years imprisonment and ordered that the $2,506,998 he failed to declare be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria. The convict then approached the Court of Appeal for reprieve but lost. In a lead judgement delivered by Justice Musa Datijo Muhammed, the panel of justices in a unanimous decision upheld the submission of counsel for the EFCC, Ekele Iheanacho, that the appeal by convict lacked merit. Chibuike was arrested on October 8, 2015 at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, by officers of the Nigeria Customs Service, for not declaring the $2,506,998 in his possession and was subsequently handed over to the EFCC for prosecution.

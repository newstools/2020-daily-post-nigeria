Liverpool just needs to win their next six matches and they will be crowned Premier League champions for the first time in 30 years. The Reds hammered Southampton 4-0 on Saturday, to open a 22-point gap at the top of the table. Although the Saints put up a fight in the first half and almost took the lead, the score remained 0-0 at half time. Mohammed Salah and co turned up the heat after the break, to take all three points. Manchester City traveled to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, hoping to cut down on that lead, but were stunned by Jose Mourinho’s men. Ilkay Gundogan missed from the spot, before Zinchenko was shown a second yellow card. From that point on, the game was won and lost. Debutant, Steven Bergwijn slammed Spurs in front, before Heung-Min Son doubled their advantage. Jurgen Klopp’s men face Norwich, West Ham, Watford, Bournemouth, Everton and Crystal Palace in the next six games. They might even be champions before the Palace game.

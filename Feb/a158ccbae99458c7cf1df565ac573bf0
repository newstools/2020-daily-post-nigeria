Uncertainty has trailed the death of a 12-year-old Kasarachi Odurukwe who took his own life last Wednesday by hanging. According to our correspondent in Imo state, the diseased is from Agbaola Ishiala Umudi Autonomous Community in Nkwerre Local Government Area of the state. Reports say Kasarachi was a pupil of practising school Umudi preparing to sit for common entrance examination. Although, the reason for hanging himself was not very clear, many argued it was after the death of his parents that the poor boy started acting strange. Further reports disclosed that he stayed with his late motherâ€™s sister with his two siblings and had often complained of how unfair the world had turned to him. He was said to have gone to the stream to fetch water alongside his two small siblings and while he had fetched water for his siblings, he asked them to start going. Sources said that he made for a nearby stick to test the depth of the stream. Not satisfied with the shallowness of the stream, he shifted ground and brought out a long rope from his pocket, tied it on an Indian bamboo tree around, put his neck and fell down. He did that once more and went for a stronger bamboo where he again tied his neck and was strangled to death. Eyewitnesses said that the police were immediately alerted by some elderly people who came to fetch water. As at the time of filing this report, his corpse has been deposited to the mortuary and investigation still ongoing.

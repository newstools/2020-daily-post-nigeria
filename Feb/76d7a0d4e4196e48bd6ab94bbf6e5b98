Manchester United player, Jaap Stam, has given his own judgment on striker Odion Ighalo’s move to Old Trafford ahead of the Red Devils’ UEFA Europa League round of 32 first leg tie against Club Brugge on Thursday night. Ighalo joined the Red Devils on January’s transfer deadline day from Shanghai Shenhua on a six-month loan deal. Stam believes the Nigerian striker would be a successful player at Man United because he is a proven goal scorer. “Ighalo has played in the Premier League in the past for Watford before he left for China,” Stam told 888Sport. “His move to Man United surprised many people but I hope he shock them with fantastic performance during his stay at the club. “He is a proven goal scorer that has physique and that was why United went for him because they needed a striker last transfer. “With the good players around him just like we saw against Chelsea, he will perform well for the Old Trafford club.”

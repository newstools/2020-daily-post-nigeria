The Premier League has confirmed that the game between Manchester City and West Ham, will now be played on Wednesday, February 19. The fixture was originally fixed for last Sunday at the Etihad Stadium. However, it was postponed due to the severe weather conditions caused by Storm Ciara. City released a statement on Sunday, to explain that the game had to be rescheduled, in the “interests of supporters and staff safety”. The rearranged date will mean that both clubs cut short their winter breaks. Upon their return to action, Guardiola’s side are now due to play six games in 19 days until March 8.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday, queried the Federal Government’s delay in arresting the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, for openly inciting the attack on Justice Mary Odili, following the Supreme Court’s Judgment on the Bayelsa State governorship election. PDP said it was clear that the attack on Justice Odili by thugs of the All Progressives Congress,APC, was part of APC’s plot to intimidate, harass and cow the judiciary and judges to do only its bidding in delivering judgments on cases involving its members. The party stated this in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan. Accorsing to the PDP: “The APC should know that Nigerians are not deceived by the desperate effort by its leadership to politicize the attack on Justice Odili by making flimsy and baseless allegations against the PDP, in a failed bid to divert public attention from their culpability in the attack. “Nigerians know that the APC masterminded the attack on Justice Odili, using the same agents that coordinated the attacks on the residence of Governor Duoye Diri, the burning of PDP secretariat in Bayelsa and violent attacks on Radio Bayelsa by APC thugs. “Our party, therefore, will definitely not allow the APC to drag it into politicizing these attacks.” PDP insisted that the delay in arresting Oshiomhole for questioning, after it raised the alarm last Thursday and even after “hard evidence indicts him and the APC, only goes to validate public apprehensions of a huge collusion with certain agents of the Buhari Presidency to intimidate and annex the judiciary.” PDP described as distressing that the “Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, had failed to arrest Oshiomhole after he openly instigated his party’s thugs against the Supreme Court and even declared that no governor would be sworn-in in Bayelsa, in defiance of the judgment of the Supreme Court, leading to the attacks.” The party charged the “Police not to succumb to the antics of the APC but to immediately bring Oshiomhole to book on the attack on Justice Odili as well as the residence of Governor Duoye Diri and PDP secretariat in Bayelsa.”

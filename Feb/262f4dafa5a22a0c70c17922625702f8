The Adamawa State Police Command has arrested a 35-year-old man, John Pwadon, allegedly for stabbing his friend’s five-year-old child to death in the state capital, Yola. It was gathered Tuesday that the incident happened last Friday when Pwadon, after spending the previous night as a guest of his friend, was waiting for breakfast in the living room when he reached for five-year-old David Tarfa and stabbed him with a knife. David’s father, Stephen Tarfa, who said Pwadon was his friend who visited him after five years of separation, threw much light on the incident. “He has been my friend for the past ten years but we’ve not seen for the past five years until he came visiting last Friday and we accommodated him just the way you would do to a respected old friend,” Stephen Tarfa said. He added, “In the morning he was with my kids watching cartoons in the parlour, because it was their midterm break, so they didn’t go to school. “My wife was in the kitchen preparing breakfast and I was in the bedroom when my daughter cried for help for us to rescue her brother. “We both ran to the parlour and found John stabbing my son repeatedly in his neck. I managed to wrestle him down but it was too late, my little kid was already down in the pool of his blood.” The Police Public Relations Officer of the state, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, said Pwado had confessed to stabbing his friend’s child, and that he would be arraigned before a court of law Wednesday.

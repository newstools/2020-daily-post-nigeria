Chelsea, Manchester United and Arsenal all won this weekend, as the race to finish in Champions League places in England begins to hot up. Frank Lampard’s men who were fourth before any ball was kicked, defeated Tottenham Hotspur 2-1 in Saturday’s early kick-off. The Blues’ double over Jose Mourinho’s men opened up a four-point gap between them and Spurs ahead of today’s games. United closed the gap to three points, with an easy 3-0 victory over Watford at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes scored from the penalty spot, before Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood sealed the points for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men. They are now fifth on the log. Wolverhampton Wanderers are still in the conversation for European places and Arsenal continued their steady climb up the table, with a battling 3-2 win over Everton at the Emirates.

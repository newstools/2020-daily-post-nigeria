Chelsea legend, Eidur Gudjohnsen has criticised Premier League giants, Manchester United for signing Nigeria’s Odion Ighalo. Gudjohnsen says Ighalo’s move to Old Trafford simply means that Man United can no longer attract the best strikers in the world. DAILY POST recalls that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side secured the signing of Ighalo on transfer deadline day on loan from Shanghai Greenland Shenhua until the end of the season. Speaking in an interview with Transfer Talk podcast, Gudjohnsen said: “It comes back to the time of the season of this Ighalo’s transfer to Man United. “I do not think any of the best strikers in the world are available. “I don’t think any of the best strikers in world football are willing to join Man United anymore.”

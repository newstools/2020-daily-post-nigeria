An Assistant Inspector General of Police, AIG Zone 1, Abubakar Sadiq Bello has said that community policing remains the only alternative to the recent illegal security formations created in different parts of the country. Abubakar, who was recently deployed to Jigawa State, was responding to questions during a familiarization tour on the state. “Attorney General of the Federation has already clarified all issues with regard to the security formations in parts of the country, so I don’t want to speak on that. “But, I think community policing will answer all questions on the issue,” he noted. He said Nigeria was currently facing insecurity problems that have adversely impacted on human and national development in the country, including incidences of kidnapping, banditry, robbery, sexual violence, trafficking in persons, drugs, arms smuggling and among others. Abubakar said The Nigeria Police Force observed that the Nigeria’s insecurity challenges would only be solved through community policing. He explained that community policing is a policy that will establish partnership between the police and the community to enhance efficiency, reduce crime and promote accountability. The development is coming at the time when some parts of the country are forming their independent security agencies to checkmate insecurity situations in the areas.

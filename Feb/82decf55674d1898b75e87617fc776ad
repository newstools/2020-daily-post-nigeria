Dethroned WBC champion, Deontay Wilder, has declared that “the war has just begun” and has vowed to become a world champion again. The American lost to Tyson Fury last weekend in a seventh round stoppage in Las Vegas. Wilder has since blamed the weight of his ring-walk costume, for his first ever defeat. Although there were reports he could sack trainer Mark Breland for throwing in the towel, Wilder has since admitted that his corner had his best interests at heart. He is expected to take up his option for a third fight with Fury, and in a video posted on social media, he promised to rise “like a phoenix from the ashes”. “Your king is in great spirits. We will rise like a phoenix from the ashes and regain the title. I’ll see you in a few months, for the war has just begun. All my love to all my people,” Wilder said.

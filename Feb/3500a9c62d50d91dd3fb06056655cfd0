Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo, has admitted that his side’s Coppa Italia semi-final first leg 1-1 draw against Zlatan Ibrahimović-led AC Milan on Thursday night at San Siro was ‘tough’. Ronaldo also urged his teammates to stay strong together when they play against AC Milan in the second leg on March 4 at Allianz. Ante Rebic’s volley gave AC Milan the lead in 61 minutes after a string of good saves from Juventus veteran goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon. But Stefano Pioli’s side was reduced to 10-men for the final 18 minutes during the encounter when defender Theo Hernandez was given a second yellow card for a strong challenge on Paulo Dybala. Ronaldo, however, scored a late penalty to rescue Maurizio Sarri’s men. In a post on his official Instagram page after the match, the 35-year-old wrote: “Tough game, but we stick together as a team, and now we have the second leg at home. “With the support of our supporters, we will reach the #coppaitalia final.”

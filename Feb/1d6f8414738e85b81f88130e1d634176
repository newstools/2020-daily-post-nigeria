Paris Saint-Germain captain, Thiago Silva, has blamed himself and his teammates for giving the ball away too easily in the first half following their 2-1 defeat against Borussia Dortmund in the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday night. Dortmund defeated PSG at the Westfalenstadion Stadium, thanks to two goals from Erling Haaland. Neymar did score a goal for the French Ligue 1 champions, but Silva believes Thomas Tuchel’s men put themselves in danger. “We gave the ball too easily in the first half, and Dortmund were able to put us in danger,” PSG’s official website quoted Silva as saying after the game. “However, in the second half, it was different, and we opened the game and created many spaces against them. “Both teams have quality, but we conceded that second goal in the second, which is hard to take, but everything is still possible in the second-leg in Paris.” PSG will now host Dortmund in the second leg in Paris on March 11.

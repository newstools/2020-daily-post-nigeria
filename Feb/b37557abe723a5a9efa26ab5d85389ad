The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Bayelsa State Council, has condemned in strong terms the Friday attack on the state owned radio station, by angry youths suspected to be supporters of the All Progressive Congress (APC), in Bayelsa State. DAILY POST had earlier reported that angry mob suspected to be supporters of the APC, on Friday, attacked the premises of the Bayelsa State Broadcasting Corporation damaging and looting valuables to protest the declaration of the candidate the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Douye Diri, as the Governor-elect by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). This came as a result of the Supreme Court verdict on the November 16, 2019 Gubernatorial Election in the state. In a statement, signed by state Chairman, Comrade Samuel Numonengi and Secretary Comrade Ogio Ipigansi, they decried the situation where a Radio Station becomes the target of political violence. The council also condemned the act of vandalizing vehicles, carting away valuables and other items and injuries inflicted on staffers of the corporation, stressing that it is an aberration and a loss to the state. The statement also called on Security Agencies in the state to fish out the perpetrators of the act and bring them to book in order to serve as deterrent to others in the future. The statement further called on Bayelsans to shun violence and see one another as brothers irrespective of party affiliations. The statement also urged the management of Radio Bayelsa not to victimize Union members of the station but allow the police do their findings.

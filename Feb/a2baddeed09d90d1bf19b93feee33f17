Former Manchester United frontman, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted Chelsea and Tottenham to play out a 2-2 draw on Saturday. Both London clubs kick off this weekend’s round of fixtures in the Premier League. The Blues currently occupy fourth place, but are only one point ahead of Jose Mourinho’s men. Mourinho returns to his former stomping ground, looking to pick points that will help Spurs qualify for the Champions League next season. Chelsea won the reverse fixture 2-0, but Berbatov does not expect them to complete the double at Stamford Bridge. Berbatov told BetFair: “Chelsea are in a bit of a slump at the moment, Spurs have their problems as well, especially now that they are also without Son through injury – they are missing some big players. “I don’t think Chelsea can afford any more slip ups, the race for the top four is really tight, but I can see this one being a draw.”

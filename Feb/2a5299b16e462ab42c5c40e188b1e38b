The Presidency has reacted to a report making the rounds that one of the daughters of President Muhammadu Buhari, Zahra, has secured a job with the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA). Reports emerged that the President’s daughter has secured employment with the agency. But in a statement to DAILY POST on Wednesday, signed by Buhari’s media aide, Femi Adesina, the Presidency described the report as fraudulent. It said, “An online medium given particularly to fake news publishes that Zahra, daughter of President Muhammadu Buhari, has secured a job with the PPPRA.” It said while Zahra can work wherever she secures employment, just like any other Nigerian, the story about her securing a job with the petroleum agency “is false in every material particular. “The publication is untrue, malicious, and meant to cast aspersions at the First Family since the tendentious platform claims the job was secured fraudulently.” It urged all people of goodwill to ignore the publication.

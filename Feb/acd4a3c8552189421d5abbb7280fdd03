The Lagos State Government says it closed 309 health facilities in 2019 for non-compliance to stipulated medical standards. Dr Abiola Idowu, Executive Secretary, Health Facility Monitoring and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA), made this known in a statement on Sunday. Idowu, however, disclosed that some were reopened after they corrected the infractions. The official said HEFAMAA in January closed 20 health facilities for lack of compliance with regulatory standards. “Health security is an integral part of public security, which is the primary duty of the government. “The State government is responsible and responsive and will not shy away in its efforts to ensure the health and well-being of the people,” she said. Idowu advised all new operators to register with the agency and urged existing registered operators should ensure prompt renewal of their certificate to avoid being sanctioned. She called for information to fight against quackery and illegal operation of health facilities.

Yobe Governor, Mala Buni, says the ambition of former Lagos governor Bola Tinubu and Kaduna governor, Nasir El-Rufa’i, to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 will not cause a rift in the All Progressives Congress (APC). Buni, a former APC national secretary, spoke on Saturday in an interview with BBC Hausa. “It will further strengthen the party, this is because Buhari has laid a solid foundation in the party through his good governance,” he said. Buni, however, expressed opposition to the clamor for power shift, noting that such would limit choices available to the electorate “It was not even in an established order,” the government insisted. On insurgency, he lamented that some children in Yobe and Borno had been out of school for ten years due to the Boko Haram crisis. Meanwhile, Junaid Mohammed, a Second Republic Parliament member, has declared that the North will not surrender power in 2023. His comment was against the backdrop of South-South Elders’ recent announcement that the region was interested in producing Buhari’s successor.

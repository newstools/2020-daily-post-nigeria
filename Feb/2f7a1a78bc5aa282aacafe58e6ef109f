He made the deceleration during a one-day public consultation forum with the customers of Benin Electricity Distribution Company, BEDC and members of Civil Society group in Benin Shaibu said it will be a disservice to the electricity consumers for them to be made to pay for what they are not given adding that the BEDC must do something to ensure that the consumers are satisfied with their service. “If you are given service, you pay for service and if you are not given light, you should challenge, follow the NERC process. “First, you have to report to the Customers Complaint Unit and if you are not satisfied, you take it to the Forum Office and after which, you pass on to the Commission and your issues will be resolved and it doesn’t matter whether it is metering, whether it is transformer or service delivery. “So, you can only pay if you are given a bill good enough for you”, he said. The DGM Customer Service Standards hinted that the problem between the electricity distributor (BEDC) and the public is a communication gap and that effort must be intensified to bridge the gap.

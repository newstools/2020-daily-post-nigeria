Former Senator representing Kaduna Central, Shehu Sani has berated those who trek hundreds of kilometers in the name of celebrating their political hero. The Senator was reacting on his twitter handle to the recent trekking missions embarked by some youths in the country. Shehu Sani tweeted as saying, “those servile Youths dangerously trekking hundreds of Kilometers to ‘celebrate Governors or Presidents’ hardly participate in peaceful protests or procession on matters that directly affect their lives, their country or their generation.” Reports have it that, Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje has rewarded one Nura Aliyu Batsari with N.5m, Hajji seat and computer laptop for trekking from Katsina state to Kano state to celebrate the governor’s recently victory at the Supreme Court. Similarly, Usman Zubairu is also embarking on the same adventurous trekking from Hadeja to Maiduguri to honor Governor Babagana Umara Zulum. However, Zubairu’s effort was rejected by the governor in a twitter, urging the trekker to put an end to his journey.

Inter Milan manager, Antonio Conte, has said his side “can have a dream” of winning the Serie A title this season. Conte stated this while speaking to Sky Italia, following their 4-2 comeback win against AC Milan on Sunday. The Italian admits they were at risk of “a hammering” having gone two goals down in the first half, before fighting back to win and go top of the table. Ante Rebic and Zlatan Ibrahimovic put Milan two up before the break, but Marcelo Brozovic and Matias Vecino equalized within eight minutes of the second half. Stefan de Vrij gave Inter the lead, before Romelu Lukaku sealed the points in stoppage time. “The first half saw us in real difficulty, perhaps more than we’ve ever been this season, and there was the risk of a hammering. “Instead, we did well to get the balance back, to understand where we had to improve, to have faith in what we were doing and the credit goes to these lads. “Aside from the result, I am happy to see them resist under blows and turn it around, as that means they are preparing for something truly important. “It’s still very early to talk about something we can for now dream of. We can have a dream,” Conte said. The result means Inter are ahead of Juventus on goal difference after 23 fixtures.

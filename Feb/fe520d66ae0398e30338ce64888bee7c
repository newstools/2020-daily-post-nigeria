Referee David Coote has been dropped from this weekend’s Premier League games, after failing to send Giovani Lo Celso off, for a rash tackle on Cesar Azpilicueta. Lo Celso appeared to stamp on Azpilicueta’s leg in the second half, but was not even booked. Michael Oliver who was the centre referee for the match missed the incident and VAR waved it aside after a review. Coote has now not been named to officiate a game, appear as an assistant nor take part in Video Assistant Referee (VAR) duties. Oliver will, however, be in charge when champions-elect Liverpool travel to Watford in Saturday’s late kick-off.

The presidency says it is ready to work closely with the Nigeria Diaspora Voting Council (NDVC) to actualise the participation of Nigerians abroad in elections. Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said this in Abuja on Monday, at a Stakeholders’ Workshop organised by the council. Represented by Femi Ojudu, Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Political Matters, Osinbajo said that the current administration had endorsed diaspora voting. He said there was need for all stakeholders “to approach and work with the National Assembly to amend the constitution in order to accommodate those in diaspora to vote during our elections. “This now goes to the legislature to make this a reality, namely: an amendment of the laws by the National Assembly so that those in the diaspora can vote in future elections. “In the words of the President in Addis Ababa, `you will need to convince the National Assembly to amend the relevant laws to make diaspora voting a reality’,” Osinbajo added.

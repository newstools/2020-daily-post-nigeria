Premier League holders, Manchester City Could be relegated to League Two if their appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sports fails, according UK Independent’s Miguel Delaney. UEFA banned City from both the Champions League and Europa League on Friday Pep Guardiola’s side was found to have committed “serious breaches” of UEFA’s club licensing and Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. Delaney’s report claimed that the Premier League will now respond to the ‘serious breaches’ which will come in the form of a points deduction. Another eye-brow raising points in the report is that the Citizens could technically be dumped in League Two by way of a possible expulsion from the Premier League. Premier League have the power to expel teams and a new rule states that any such club would have to start rebuilding in the fourth tier. The report explains: “While no one sees an expulsion from the Premier League as likely, the Football League have recently changed their rules so that any club in that situation must start again in League Two.”

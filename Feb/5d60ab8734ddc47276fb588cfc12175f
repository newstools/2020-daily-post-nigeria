Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has hinted that he would like to have new Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo back in the national team. Ighalo retired from the national team after leading Super Eagles to win bronze at the 2019 African Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Egypt. The 30-year-old joined the Red Devils on transfer deadline day on loan from Shanghai Greenland Shenhua until the end of the season to become the first Nigerian player to play for the Old Trafford club. Speaking in an interview with AOIFootball, Rohr said the young players in the Super Eagles could learn a lot from Ighalo, who he described as a great goal scorer. The 66-year-old said: “We are pleased about Ighalo’s new team, joining Manchester United is a fantastic challenge for him as a player, and I spoke already with him, and you know he is an excellent player on and off the pitch. “If a player is playing for Manchester United, every coach of a national teams would like to have such a player. “Our young players in the team could learn a lot on the side of this great goal scorer.”

Former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder, Emmanuel Petit has said that Lionel Messi may leave the Catalan club next summer. The future of the Argentine captain has been thrown into doubt following his clash with Sporting Director, Eric Abidal. The Argentine captain can leave Nou Camp for nothing in the summer thanks to a clause added in his contract. “With the Eric Abidal and Lionel Messi situation, it all depends on what happens in the next transfer window,” Petit was quoted by the Mirror. He went on to explain that many players at the club, including Messi were disappointed with how the club had handled last summer transfer activity, “with so many players rumoured to come in who never came, Neymar being one example.” “When you add in the investigation into medical procedures involving Abidal and the club, it has all contributed to his [Messi] image being slightly affected. “Abidal has also had recent trouble with Xavi, who’s a legend at Barca. “It was hard to understand what was going on there, with talk of Xavi joining as manager — it was all very unclear. “Seeing Xavi’s reaction afterwards, it showed that there’s a lack of communication and that someone is lying. “Something similar has happened with Messi. “We’re not used to Messi speaking out on social media in such a manner,” he said. He noted that Messi, whon he said is Usually very quiet, “so clearly he must be very upset.” “If you look at Abidal’s place in all this, I’m sure the club will be looking ahead to the next transfer window and looking at his responsibility for it,” the former France international added.

One Mrs Fatimah Jimoh, on Thursday prayed an Area Court in Ilorin, Kwara State to grant her request for divorce from her husband of eight years. Fatimah, a housewife is requesting a divorce on grounds that her husband, Amosa hits her and does not provide money for food. She alleged that her husband beats her for no reason. “My husband beats me every time. Every argument will prompt him to beat me. ”He doesn’t provide money for feeding. He is not taking care of me and the children. He is not playing his fatherly role as expected, ‘ she told the court. She also prayed the court to grant her custody of the four children and sought an order of the court for Amosa to pay N20,000 monthly as feeding allowance for the children.” The defendant was absent from court to respond to the allegation. The Presiding Judge, Mr Abdulhameed Aliyu, however, adjourned the case until March 25, for continuation of hearing and for the defendant to appear in court.

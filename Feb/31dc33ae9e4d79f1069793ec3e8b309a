A case of alleged infringement on the fundamental human rights of Muhammad Ibrahim Musa Gashash in a suit no: FHC/ KD/CS/5/2020 before Justice Zainab Abubakar of the Federal High Court, Kaduna has been adjourned for hearing to 2nd April, 2020. Muhammad Ibrahim Musa Gashash had through his legal counsel, Barrister Umar Magaji approached the Court on what he described as an infringement on his fundamental human rights by Nigerian Army, the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 Division and the Director-General of the State Security Services for illegal and unlawful arrest. Recall that on January 1, 2020, about 20 Army personnel of the 1 Division Nigerian Army, Kaduna allegedly invaded the house of the businessman in Kakuri, without a search warrant and whisked him away. In his prayers, Gashash, through his legal counsel, Umar Magaji stated that his arrest and detention by the respondents beyond the period prescribed by the 1999 constitution was illegal. He was, however, released after Justice Zainab Abubakar, granted an application filed by his Counsel, directing the Nigerian Army and the DSS to release him with immediate effect. At the first hearing of the case on Tuesday, 11th February 2020, the case was adjourned to enable the applicant file affidavit removing the 4th respondent (DG SSS), from the trial since they had already been served with the court summons after counsel to the applicant had notified the court of the intention to remove the DG DSS from the case. In his argument, Umar Magaji insisted on continuing the case with the 4th respondent. After the submissions of both counsels, the Presiding Judge, Justice Zainab Abubakar, adjourned the case to 2nd April, 2020 for ruling.

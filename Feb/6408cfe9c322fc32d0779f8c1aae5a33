Odion Ighalo has always been a Manchester United fan. Every old picture and interview points to that fact. So when the chance to sign for the Red Devils came his way, the transfer deadline could not stop him. Ighalo accepted a pay cut to complete his “dream move” to Old Trafford. The 30-year-old was brought in by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, to ensure United get to the end of the season with a proper striker, following Marcus Rashford’s back problem. However, on Saturday, there was a little setback. Ighalo was taken out of the squad that travelled for warm-weather training in Spain. The Nigerian striker has been left out over fears the coronavirus outbreak, could lead to him being denied entry back into the UK. A club statement said: “The club can also confirm that, due to the current situation in China, it has been decided that new signing, Odion Ighalo will not travel to Spain as it is not guaranteed that he’d clear UK immigration on return should border restrictions tighten on travellers who’ve been in China within the past 14 days.” Ighalo has stayed back in Manchester, where he is taking part in double training sessions to keep fit. United travel to Chelsea after their winter break. Don’t bet on Ighalo leading the line at Stamford and scoring.

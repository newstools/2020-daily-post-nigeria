Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has explained why he dropped Jesse Lingard and Andreas Pereira from his side’s squad against Watford on Sunday. Solskjaer said he decided not to play Lingard and Pereira against the visitors at Old Trafford because he has an abundance of attacking options. Lingard and Pereira both started in the Red Devils’ 1-1 draw against Club Brugge in the Europa League round of 32 first-leg tie on Thursday. When asked about Pereira and Lingard’s absences, Solskjaer told MUTV before the kick-off: “We have picked an 18-man squad that we felt it was the right players for the game “We have got cover on the bench for wide-men, forwards, midfielders and defenders so that was a decision I made.”

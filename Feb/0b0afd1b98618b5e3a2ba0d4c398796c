Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has said improving on Nigeria’s human capital development would reduce the number of Nigerian youths recruited into Boko Haram and banditry. Osinbajo said providing opportunities for youths to earn a living or get educated will help reduce recruitment into Boko Haram and other criminal groups. The Vice President stated that the federal government needed to cater for the poor because they are vulnerable to jeopardizing national security. He spoke while delivering a lecture at the National Defence College, Course 28 yesterday, and was contained in a statement signed and sent to DAILY POST by his office. According to Osinbajo: “Improving human capital development, especially education, and providing more opportunities for earning a living, will reduce the numbers of young persons available for recruitment into the ranks of the Boko Haram and ISWAP terrorists in the North East, and the bandits and other criminals around the country. “The poor are especially vulnerable to jeopardizing national security and that is why government needs to make adequate provision for that class of people. “Man is central to the economy, if anything makes it difficult or impossible for him to function, the economy is weak and the whole progress of the community is stalled.” Osinbajo’s comment is coming at a time when the National Assembly passed a vote of no-confidence on the military, police and other security architecture in the country, following the high rate of insecurity witnessed.

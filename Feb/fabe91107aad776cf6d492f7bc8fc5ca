The Niger State government has been asked to declare state of emergency in the state as a result of insecurity in all the local government areas. The state House of Assembly made the call during a motion on a matter of urgent public importance presented by Mr Malik Bosso, representing Bosso Constituency at the plenary in Minna on Tuesday. The Assembly further called for urgent solutions to the security issue lingering in the state, NAN reports. Alhaji Abdullahi Wuse, the Speaker of the House, lamenting about security issues, appealed to the Committee on Security and other members to interface with heads of security agencies and relevant security stakeholders. Bosso raised alarm over increasing insecurity in most parts of the state, particularly in Gurumana, Shiroro local government area, where over 300 bandits recently attacked. He lamented that the issue of insecurity was already spreading across other local government areas such as Shiroro, Munya, Rafi, Paikoro, Borgu, Magama, Mariga and Kontagora. He called for urgent measures to be taken to curb the bandits threats before it becomes worse. Bosso stressed the need to amend the law dealing with kidnapping and cattle rustling and called for stiffer punishments for anyone caught serving as informant to the criminals. Alhaji Ahmed Marafa, representing Chanchaga Constituency making his contribution, raised alarm that most local government areas were under security threat due to activities of bandits. The lawmakers decried the rates of bandits attacks in their constituencies which had instilled fear in the lives of farmers. There were also contributions on rising insecurity threats across the state from other members such as Alhaji Bello Ahmad, member representing Agware, Idris Musa, representing Lapai, and Bala Mohammed, representing Borgu. Others were Hajiya Binta Mamman, representing Gurara, and Abdullahi Shaba, representing Mokwa constituencies.

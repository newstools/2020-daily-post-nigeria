FIFA president, Gianni Infantino, has lent his support to introducing the ‘daylight’ principle to the offside law. Video Assistant Referees (VAR) decisions have caused a lot of controversy in the Premier League, with a few goals chalked off because of very fine offside margins. FIFA’s chief of global football development, Arsene Wenger, last week that the law should be changed so that a player is onside if any part of their body that can score a goal is behind or level with the relevant defender. Infantino has now spoken in favour of Wenger’s proposal. “I’m certainly in favour of discussing a new way of looking at the offside rule, to see if it can help, because I think the issue is more an issue of understanding,” he said at the International Football Association Board, the game’s law-making body. “Some of (the decisions) are very, very close and it’s difficult for the people who are watching to see whether it’s offside, so we have to look at whether we can make the offside rule clearer by having light in between.”

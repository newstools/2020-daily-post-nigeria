Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has named Chelsea and the Red Devils as the two youngest teams in the Premier League. Solskjaer said this ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash with Chelsea on Monday night at Stamford Bridge. Solskjaer’s men head to the game following a goalless draw against Wolves in their last encounter. “Man United and Chelsea are truly the two youngest teams in the Premier League,” Solskjaer said as quoted by Man United’s official website. “What Frank Lampard has been doing for Chelsea so far this season and what I am also doing for United, you can see the similarity. “Lampard has controlled and he has done well with Chelsea because of the transfer ban during the summer window. “I think both of us believe if you give young players a chance, they will give their best make surprises.”

Juventus legend Alessandro Del Piero, has hailed Liverpool ace, Mohamed Salah as a ‘God’ in football. Del Piero said this ahead of Liverpool’s Champions League round of 16 first-leg tie against Atletico Madrid on Tuesday night. According to him, the Egyptian international has improved greatly in his style of play since leaving AS Roma for Liverpool in 2017. “Mohamed Salah is now a God and not only in Egypt,” Del Piero was quoted by Goal as saying. “I remember when he was playing for AS Roma, he had a lot of chances to score in front of goal and missed it. “And presently he has improved at Liverpool and he has scored more than thirty goals in a season. “It is the best thing for him because he has the mentality to improve and grow.” Salah has scored 18 goals in all competitions for Jurgen Klopp’s side so far this season.

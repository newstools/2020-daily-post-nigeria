Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has called on forward, Anthony Martial to keep on scoring for the club following their 3-0 win over Watford in the Premier League on Sunday. Man United defeated Watford at Old Trafford, thanks to three goals from Bruno Fernandes, Anthony Martial, and Mason Greenwood. Martial’s goal against Watford means the France international has now scored three goals in his last three games for the Red Devils against Chelsea, Club Brugge, and Watford. Speaking after the game, Solskjaer was quoted by MEN as telling reporters at his post-match conference: “I am happy for Martial. He has had a fantastic week and I am one of his biggest critics. “I keep on demanding different stuff from him. “But this week he has come up with a number nine centre forward’s goal – a header – against Chelsea. “He did everything to get the goal against Brugge; defending, winning the ball, running through. “And today is the Martial we know more about. “The skill is just mind-blowing, sometimes the skills he shows. But I want more from him and I will keep on at him.”

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has reacted as residents of Maiduguri, Borno State booed President Muhammadu Buhari during his sympathy visit to the state over recent Boko Haram attack in the state. PDP charged Buhari to go beyond his sympathy visit and take decisive steps towards ending the killings in the state and other parts of the country. A statement by PDP’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan said the “booing of President Buhari in Borno State is a clear message to him that Nigerians hold him responsible for the escalated insecurity in the country. ” The booing also shows a loss of confidence in the Buhari Presidency and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).” The PDP called on Buhari should not limit his visit to Borno State but also visit other parts of the country, including Kaduna, Kano, Benue, Plateau, Yobe, Adamawa, Zamfara, Kogi, Niger, Taraba and other
states to “face the feelings of Nigerians as well as view the national devastation his poor handling of security and infrastructure has caused our nation.” Buhari, who had returned to Nigeria from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia headed for Maiduguri to condole with people of the state over Boko Haram’s latest attack. A bomb attack by Boko Haram on Sunday had led to the death of about 30 people in Auno, Maiduguri.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) has prayed for good health and wisdom for Governor Nasir El-Rufai “as he continues to inspire the younger generation” and contribute to party development, Kaduna State and Nigeria. APC said this in his message to the governor who clocks 60 on Sunday, February 16. Lanre Issa-Onilu, National Publicity Secretary, in a statement on Saturday, stated that the party was proud to identify with El-Rufai whose trademark has been a fearless and people-focused leadership. It recalled the legacies of El-Rufai’s as the former Director General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises and Minister of Federal Capital Territory (FCT). APC noted that El-Rufai’s courage in the pursuit of common good hallmarked his determination in implementing and restoring the Abuja masterplan. “In our national discourse, El-Rufai has been vocal on issues bothering on good governance and how to make our nation’s constituent units and institutions work optimally. “The report of the Governor El-Rufai headed committee on True Federalism remains a reference point in the debates on restructuring and devolution of powers.” APC said as governor, El-Rufai has recorded tremendous success despite the dwindling revenue accruing to the state from the federal allocation. “The El-Rufai administration has positioned Kaduna Stare as a top destination for investors who are benefiting from its various developmental policies and the investment friendly environment”, it added.

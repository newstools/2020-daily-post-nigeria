Manchester City are the latest Premier League side, that are looking to sign Samuel Chukwueze from Villarreal, according to the Daily Mail. City have joined Liverpool and Chelsea in the chase for the Super Eagles winger. The Reds are believed to have seen a bid of â‚¬35million for Chukwueze rejected in January. The 20-year-old has a 65million release clause in his contract. However, Pep Guardiola is an admirer of the Nigerian and will fight off competition to bring him to the Etihad in the summer. With Leroy Sane still heavily linked with Bayern Munich, Guardiola is expected to be in the market for wide men. Chukwueze has netted four goals and provided four assists in 26 appearances this season.

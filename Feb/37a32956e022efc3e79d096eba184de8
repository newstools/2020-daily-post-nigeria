Former Brazil and Real Madrid star, Kaka, has said Lionel Messi could leave Barcelona for England. Messi was recently involved in a public spat with sporting director, Eric Abidal, who had questioned players’ commitment under former manager, Ernesto Valverde. It had led to speculations that the Argentina captain could quit the Camp Nou in the summer. Kaka, speaking with Sky Sports, believes the day could come when Messi departs from Barca. He said: “I think it’s not going to be a problem for him to play in the Premier League, or [to play] at a top club at the top three leagues in the world would be good for him. “But of course it depends on what he wants for his career. It’s hard to see him playing for another club, but it’s just … [he may feel,] ‘It’s okay, it’s time for me to change and I’ll go to have another experience and I’ll be the best football player in the world for another team.” Kaka also compared a possible Messi exit, to when Cristiano Ronaldo left Real Madrid for Juventus in 2018. “I think the most important thing is not the broken part but the way this is going to be broken. “When [Cristiano] Ronaldo left Madrid we were sad that Ronaldo left the club and of course a lot of them regret Ronaldo’s left Real Madrid,” Kaka said. Messi has a clause in his current deal, which allows him to walk away for free at the end of the season.

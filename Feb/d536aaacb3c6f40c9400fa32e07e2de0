A 50-year-old man, Mr Sunday Ezenwaka Chukwuneta has been arrested by operatives of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC for vandalising the roofing of the abandoned new Anambra government house project in Awka. It was gathered that the suspect who hails from Oba, Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State had vandalised the roofing of the gigantic structure, with the aim of taking away its metal frames and roofing sheets. The abandoned government house project has been in controversy after it was started during the days of former governor, Dr Chinwoke Mbadinuju, and had been abandoned by successive governments, causing vandals to steal most property in the site. Mr David Bille, Commandant of the NSCDC in Awka who disclosed the arrest of Chukwuneta said, “On the 14/02/2020 at about 16:34hrs, through credible intelligence, and intensive patrol, operatives of NSCDC arrested one Sunday Ezenwaka Chukwuneta ‘m’ aged 50 from Oba in Idemili North LGA for vandalism and stealing of Iron Roofing frame of Government building under construction Behind Ekwueme Square opposite Anambra State Government Secretariat Awka in Awka South LGA Anambra State. “Exhibit recovered from him include vandalized iron roof and spanners.

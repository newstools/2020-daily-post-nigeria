Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has hailed the Supreme Court decision on the Bayelsa governorship election. The court sacked David Lyon of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his running mate, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, over the latter’s document forgery. In a statement on Thursday, Atiku said he received the verdict which ultimately declared the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Douye Diri, as the duly elected Governor, with gladness. He said: “Senator Douye Diri had cause to visit with me before the elections and received my blessings and counsel. “I am fully satisfied that he has what it takes to make Bayelsa the ‘glory of all lands’. His intellect, personality and character, are a credit to Bayelsa and the PDP. “I congratulate Senator Douye Diri and his running mate, Mr. Lawrence Ewhrujakpor. I also felicitate with the Peoples Democratic Party. “The Lords Justices have given us another opportunity to show Nigerians that power belongs to the people, and we must make good use of this opportunity.” The former VP called on all the people of Bayelsa to make peace with the recent past and embrace the future together. The PDP presidential candidate in the 2019 election urged the people to be united in the mission to transform the state into a haven of peace and prosperity. He urgedthe Supreme Court to show consistency in its judgments and find the resolve to always deliver just-judgments no matter whose ox is gored. Atiku added that he people of Nigeria are behind the apex court in whatever they do to free themselves from the dominance of dictatorial forces.

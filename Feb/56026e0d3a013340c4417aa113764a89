Real Madrid captain, Sergio Ramos, has blamed himself and his teammates for not being able to convert their chances to score a goal following their 1-0 defeat against Levante in La Liga on Saturday. He also commented on forward Eden Hazard’s injury after the Belgium international sustained a knock against Levante. Levante defeated Zinedine Zidane’s men at home, thanks to Jose Luis Nogales’s second-half strike. Speaking after the game, Ramos was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying: “We created some good chances against them but could not score. “Levante only created one good chance, and they converted it. “We just lacked a goal against the host, and now we are devastated with the result, but we need to work hard together and move ahead because we have two tough matches against Man City and Barcelona.” He added: “Hazard’s injury is bad news, hopefully, it’s not as bad as is first looked. “We hope he comes back as soon as possible because he is helping the team, and now he has sustained another wound.”

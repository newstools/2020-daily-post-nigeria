Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has ruled out Son Heung-Min until next season. Son is expected to miss the next two months after the club confirmed he broke his arm during their 3-2 win at Aston Villa last weekend. The South Korean forward netted twice including a last-gasp winner, having picked up the injury in the first minute of the game. Mourinho now faces the prospect of playing the rest of the season without a recognised striker. Speaking to the media on Tuesday ahead of their Champions League trip to RB Leipzig, the Portuguese insisted that youngster Troy Parrott is not ready for the first team. “I’m not going to count on him (Son) again this season. If he plays two or three games then it’s because he (press officer) is very optimistic, but I’m not counting on him. “Now we have two options. To fall and die because it’s the fourth floor. The other is to climb. We will be on that balcony fighting with everything we have. There is only one possibility. No strikers, no market, no players nothing. The only help now is our crowd. The Tottenham supporters. That’s the only thing I ask because I can’t ask any more from the players that they’re giving, which is everything they have,” Mourinho said.

Quique Setien has said he does not regret replacing Ernesto Valverde as Barcelona manager, following the latest crisis at the club. Captain Lionel Messi started a war of words with sporting director, Eric Abidal, this week. Abidal had claimed some players did not work hard under Valverde, before Messi fired back asking him to face his job. Speaking to the media on Wednesday, Setien insisted he knew what to expect when he took over at the Camp Nou. “Of course I don’t [regret taking over]. It is true when I was sat at home out of work I didn’t have any problems. “But when you arrive at a club like this you expect things to happen and for them to be amplified. My life has never been easy. This is what you imagine happens when you arrive at a team of this stature,” Setien said. Setien also confirmed he spoke to Messi about the incident, but it was not a long conversation. “These things don’t affect me. I try to make sure they don’t affect my players, either. “We spoke about it for one minute earlier but that was all. What interests me is football. At any club of this size, there are problems, but they are not things I can control.” Barca play Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey quarter-final on Thursday. Setien has said Messi was in good spirits in training on Wednesday morning ahead of the fixture. He said: “He was in good spirits this morning and smiling. He loves coming in and training and he was the same today as he was yesterday. “He has the experience and the capacity to decide [what he does]. I am not going to get involved in his life – or in anyone else’s. I am not his father.” Barca president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, earlier on called a meeting with Abidal, to discuss his future at Camp Nou following the clash with Messi. There are already speculations that the Frenchman might lose his job.

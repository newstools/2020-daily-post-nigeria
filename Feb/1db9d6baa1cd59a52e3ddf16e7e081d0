Former President Olusegun Obasanjoâ€™s house was said to have caught fire on Wednesday. The inferno, DAILY POST learnt, started around 9pm on one side of the house, which is located at Ita Eko area of Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. Our correspondent gathered that fire fighters immediately responded to distress call as they swung into action and succeeded in putting out the fire. This, it was learnt, prevented the fire from consuming the entire building and escalating to other nearby houses. DAILY POST could not confirm immediately confirm the cause of the late hour fire accident. Contacted, the spokesperson to Obasanjo, Kehinde Akinyemi, said he would get back to our correspondent.

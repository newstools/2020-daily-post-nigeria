A Chief Magistrates’ Court, in Bukuru, Plateau, has ordered personal service of a subpoena on Prophetess Deborah, wife of a clergy, Danjuma Fwenji, for alleged enticement. Danjuma is the General Overseer, God’s Grace Divine Mission (GGDM). Chief Magistrate Anderawus Maikai ruled on Tuesday on a motion filed by the Fwenji counsel, Ms Tayo Otitoju. NAN reports that Leonard Dilkon, a former lawmaker, had dragged Deborah to court for allegedly enticing his wife, Joy, which led to their divorce. Dilkon, had through his counsel, Francis Okafor, secured a subpoena to be served on the Prophetess as a star witness on March 21, 2019, but service on her personally proved abortive. Dilkon later got a second subpoena on April 19 but service on Deborah was unsuccessful again. The chief Magistrate said: “This honorable court first gave an order which was not properly carried out. Again the court gave another, which again wasn’t properly served on the witness. “The service must not be through the counsels as the respondent/complainant (Dilkon) tries to do but it must to her personally and l so rule in favor of the applicant (Fwenji). “Consequently, this court hereby order that a proper service should be made on Prophetess Deborah directly and personally for her to appear on the next adjourned date”. The case was adjourned until March 3 for continuation of hearing.

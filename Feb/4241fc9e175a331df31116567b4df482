Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has revealed that the club failed to bring in Hakim Ziyech in the January window. Ziyech will move to Stamford Bridge after this season, after the Blues agreed a £37million deal with Ajax. However, the Premier League tried to bring in the 26-year-old last month. “We tried and it was not possible. We all know how the January window works. “You respect clubs that have top players want to keep them and that was the case. But that is done and we have him for next season. Pleased with that. “He will be something different for us so we’re excited. I know he’s not coming in now but I think it’s exciting for us as a club and for the fans to know that he’ll be here next year,” Lampard told Sky Sports. Ziyech is Chelsea’s first signing since their transfer ban was lifted. He has featured 18 times in the Eredivisie this season, scoring six goals and providing 13 assists.

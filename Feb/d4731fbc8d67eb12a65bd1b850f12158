There was more Video Assistant Referee (VAR) controversy on Saturday, as Tottenham Hotspur’s Lo Celso escaped a red card for a stamp on Cesar Azpilicueta. VAR official, David Coote, decided that the playmaker had accidentally stepped on Azpilicueta. It led to an angry reaction from Blues boss, Frank Lampard and the crowd inside Stamford Bridge. However, VAR chiefs have now admitted Coote got the big call wrong. “We have been speaking to Stockley Park who have admitted they got the decision wrong and Lo Celso should have been sent off,” BT Sport pundit, Jake Humphrey, tweeted. Olivier Giroud and Marcos Alonso scored for Chelsea before Spurs halved the deficit. Thanks to an Antonio Rudiger own goal.

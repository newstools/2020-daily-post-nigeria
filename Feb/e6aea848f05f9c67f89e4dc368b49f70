A State High Court sitting in Onitsha, the commercial hub of Anambra State has convicted one Udenze Ikenna Kenneth, over N2.9m fraud. DAILY POST learnt that Kenneth’s conviction came upon his prosecution by the Enugu Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. The court also handed the convict three years imprisonment. EFCC acting spokesman, Tony Orilade disclosed this in a statement in Abuja. Orilade affirmed that the convict’s ordeal began sometime in 2019 when a petitioner alleged that he falsely presented himself to be one Dickson Amabebe, and opened an account in Access Bank Plc and used same to fraudulently receive the sum of N2.9 Million from a Non-Governmental Organisation called Nigeria Interfaith Action Association (NIFAA). Further investigation also revealed that Udenze was a member of a syndicate that hacks into websites of organisations, then asume the identity of the organisation using a fictitious name. On this premise, the convict had instructed Zenith Bank to transfer the said amount to several accounts, including his, for supply made to NIFAA. But, the fraud was then detected when the organisation complained to Zenith Bank of the illegal withdrawal/transfer, which prompted the bank to stop further transfer to five other fake beneficiaries. Also, the EFCC prosecution reportedly led by Michael Ikechukwu Ani and Onome Marshal Umukoro presented one witness and tendered five exhibits to convict Udenze, it was learnt.

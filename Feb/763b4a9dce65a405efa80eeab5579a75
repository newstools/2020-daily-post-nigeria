Some ex-Militant leaders from the nine states of the Niger Delta region have described as “expected” and “commendable” the sack of the Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, Professor Charles Dokubo. They said the sack by President Mohammed Buhari, showed the present administration has the interest of the region at heart. Recall that DAILY POST reported that President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday, suspended the coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, Professor Charles Dokubo. Buhari, in a statement issued by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, had also ordered that a Caretaker Committee be set up to review the programme and take over its running henceforth. The ex-militant leaders under the aegis of the Leadership, Peace and Cultural Development Initiative(LPCDI) said the sack of Professor Charles Dokubo is long overdue, and shows that the National Security Adviser, Babagana Monguno has the interest of the Amnesty programme at heart and offer to support him at any time the needs rises . The LCPDI, in statement issued in Yenagoa , signed and sent to DAILY POST by its President, Clifford Reuben, noted that the ex-agitators passed a vote of confidence on Babagana Moguno and urging him to have an audience with them so as to lend their advice on the best way to rejig the programme to its original intent . They said, “We want to assure you of our total support on the success of the Amnesty and that we can bring an end to all acrimony surrounding fictitious groups and criminal elements that are always dragging the programme backward for selfish gains because as it stands now nobody can handle the programme without involving the critical stakeholders who understand the programme from the onset. ” “Now that President Buhari has finally listened to our voice and put a stop to the threat against the existing peace in the region, ‘we thank God that those days when Amnesty office and the budgeted funds meant for ex-militants are diverted and the new amnesty office should be made up of ex militant leaders who were in Niger Delta struggle and understand the problems of the youths of the region.” “Lastly, it is germane that the new Amnesty office should be presided over by those that will not rubbish the achievement recorded by the President Buhari administration in the Niger Delta and also we are ready to work and give the committee all necessary assistance.“

Former Manchester United goalkeeper, Mark Bosnich, has said that new striker, Odion Ighalo is an emergency signing for the club. Bosnich, speaking with Sky Sports, said nobody expects anything unbelievable from the former Super Eagles striker at Old Trafford. DAILY POST had reported last Friday that Manchester United signed Ighalo on loan from Shanghai Greenland Shenhua until the end of the season. “Ighalo’s arrival was an emergency signing,” Bosnich said. “I can understand most people talking about a scattergun approach, well it had to be with Marcus Rashford being out. “A top-four finish is still possible for Manchester United, and they had to go and get somebody. “Ighalo has got nothing to lose at Man United, nobody expects anything unbelievable from him, but they needed somebody in that position. “You never know. A long, long time ago, Manchester United signed a certain Frenchman, Eric Cantona, who no one expected much from, and he ended up propelling them to one of their most successful seasons of all time.” Ighalo has since expressed happiness after joining the Red Devils. The 30-year-old said it was a dream come true for him to join Man United. He said: “It is a dream come true. I have always dreamed about Manchester United and all that well I was growing up. “This is a reality now. I cannot even say much until I get started. “I am grateful to God and my agent and to the coach who gave me this opportunity to be here. “I am happy to work hard with the team and finish very well this season.”

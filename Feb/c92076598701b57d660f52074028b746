Senate President, Dr. Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, has expressed dismay over drop calls in Nigeria without end, saying that the situation would no longer be tolerated. Speaking at a one-day joint public hearing on “the increasing rate of drop calls and unwholesome practices by Telecommunications network operators in Nigeria”, the Senate President explained that drop calls has become a menace that should not be tolerated. Lawan, however, delivered his speech and issued a stern warning to Service providers to improve on their services. He lamented that Nigerians are at the receiving end of drop calls as deductions are effected without the actual service. “It’s our duty to protect Nigerians because they are at the receiving end even as service providers deduct money from their drop calls.” The Executive Vice Chairman of NCC and his officials arrived after the Senate President had finished his speech. The Joint Committee on Communications, and Trade and Investment of the House of Representatives and the Senate conducted a one-day public hearing at the instance of a motion sponsored by Senator Abdulfatah Buhari.

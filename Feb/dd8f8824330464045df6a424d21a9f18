A member of the Board of Trustees of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief Ziggy Azike, has alleged that Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, APGA National Chairman, Victor Oye, and as well, Senator Victor Umeh, have destroyed the party. Azike said the alleged corrupt practices perpetrated by the trio during the 2018 party primaries in the country, particularly Imo State, thwarted the will of people who are yearning for a change in the state. The APGA chieftain, who made his position known, in an interview with reporters on Saturday, in Aba, also declared that the unending fraudulent activities of the party leaders had led many leaders and stakeholders leaving APGA for other progressives parties in Imo State. According to Azike, “The reality is that the trio of Obiano, Umeh and Oye have totally completely destroyed the APGA brand, in Imo State, APGA’S promise has been shattered and demolished; the APGA which Imo people prayed will come and restore their land just as NCNC, and NPP did is no more; none of the people they associated that hope will; is left; the N-APGA which was a response by the Union of APGA Governorship aspirants in Imo State is struggling to revive a highly demoralized populace; in Anambra, APGA will surely lose constituencies; if anybody under APGA wins, it will be because of the individuals rating and efforts. “The brand APGA has been damaged and no longer represents “Nkea bu nke anyi”; “this is our own”; Obiano, Umeh and Oye have managed to destroy in one fell swoop, a Legacy built by Chekwas Okorie, Peter Obi, Ikemba Nnewi, and all other Igbo patriots, who invested integrity, goodwill, sacrificial Leadership, good Governance, Patriotism and dedication to high ideals in directing the people. “Just as APGA was going national, having won a House of Representative Seat in Taraba, elections in Kaduna, FCT, and Bayelsa States; the demon spirit of Judas Iscariot captivated and enraptured the leadership of APGA today neither Obiano, Umeh or Oye can safely step into Imo State without the highest level of Security as Imo people hold them responsible for undermining and truncating their dreams and hope for a better and greater Imo State from May 29, 2019.”

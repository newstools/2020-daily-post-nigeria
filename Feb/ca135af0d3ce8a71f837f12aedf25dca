President Muhammadu Buhari has provided a major reason why he will not intervene in the face-off between Governor Ganduje of Kano State and Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II. Buhari said he has been quiet on the matter because the Nigerian Constitution does not permit him to wade into the matter. Recall that the Emir of Ningi, Alhaji Yunusa Danyaya, had during the week called on the President to urgently intervene in the rift going on between the Governor and the monarch. However, in a statement by his Spokesman, Garba Shehu, the President said, “I know my role as the President of Nigeria. “By the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, the Governor of Kano State has his own roles, once a matter is in the hands of the House of Assembly (like in Kano), the President has no constitutional right to interfere.” He further explained that he was elected by the constitution and having sworn by it, he was going to stand by it. “But let me tell you the bottom line of my understanding of the constitutional role is that peace and security of all Nigerians must be guaranteed,” Buhari said, adding that where lives of the citizens are threatened he will use his constitutional powers. Buhari called on people who have found themselves in exalted offices to live up to the promises they made to their constituents so as to justify the confidence reposed in them.

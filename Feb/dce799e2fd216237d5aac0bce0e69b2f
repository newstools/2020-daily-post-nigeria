Lille football club says its Nigerian import, Victor Osimhen will not be leaving the club in June. Barcelona, Real Madrid, Liverpool and other top European clubs are interested in signing the Super Eagles striker. However Lille president, Gerard Lopez said the player will remain at the French Ligue 1 side for the 2020-2021 season. The Nigerian international has scored 18 goals in 36 matches across all competitions this season. Lopez told RTL’s Soir de Ligue 1, “Osimhen will be at Lille next season. Afterwards, there are factors that I cannot control. “I do not control the fact that a club arrives and offers a salary six or eight times higher than what we can offer. He advised the player not to be tempted by big salaries but wait for the right time to move forward.

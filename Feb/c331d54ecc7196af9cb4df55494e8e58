DAILY POST reports that the body of the grandmother, identified as Sidikat Jimoh was discovered by her neighbours where her assailants suspected to be ritualists dumped her, with vital organs missing. The death of the victim has continued to create fear among residents of Akoko over the upsurge in ritual killings within the axis. Similar incidents had earlier been reported in Akoko communities like Ikare, Ugbe, and Arigidi Akoko with the suspected ritualists yet to be nabbed. According to one of the residents of Ogbagi, she said the deceased used to be an easy-going person who hardly had issues with anyone. She added that “the ritualists even wanted to set her dead body ablaze, but ran away, leaving behind some of the removed parts of her body. “This is mysterious, we have never experienced this kind of killing before in this town,” the source lamented. Speaking on the development, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO in the state, CSP Femi Joseph said that investigation had commenced, as he assured the assailants will be apprehended. He also disclosed that the family of the deceased had planned to bury the corpse of the victim who was a Muslim but were stopped by the police in order for a postmortem to be carried out.

Napoli’s new signing, Victor Osimhen, has said that he cannot wait to wear the club’s iconic jersey after completing his transfer move to the Serie A side on Saturday. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Osimhen joined Napoli from French Ligue 1 club, Lille on Saturday. The Nigerian striker signed for Napoli for a reported £45million. Reacting, Osimhen, in a tweet via his official Twitter handle on Saturday, also thanked Lille for their support during his time at the French club, adding that Napoli is like Lagos State. He tweeted: “Can’t wait to put on this iconic jersey, thank you for the warm welcome @sscnapoli. “Napoli like Lagos. “Change is constant, thank you for everything @losclive, God is the greatest, we move.” Osimhen scored 18 goals in 38 appearances for Lille in the 2019/20 season before he left the club for Napoli. Meanwhile, Napoli star, Dries Mertens, has since promised to help Osimhen to settle at the club next season.

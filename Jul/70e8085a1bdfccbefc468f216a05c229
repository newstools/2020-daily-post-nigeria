The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC on Thursday confirmed that indirect mode of primary will be used during the July 20, 2020 primaries of the All Progressives Congress, APC. The electoral body said that both the APC and PDP will use indirect primaries. INEC had allocated 2nd to 27th July for political parties to pick candidates for the October 10, 2020 governorship polls in Ondo State. The mode of primaries to be adopted by the APC had generated controversies as a majority of the 12 aspirants preferred direct primaries while the incumbent Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu said he would be ready for any mode of primaries adopted by the party. The state Resident Electoral Commissioner, REC in Ondo State, Ambassador Rufus Akeju who disclosed this in Akure confirmed that the indirect mode of primary election was communicated to INEC through a letter from the APC National Secretariat.

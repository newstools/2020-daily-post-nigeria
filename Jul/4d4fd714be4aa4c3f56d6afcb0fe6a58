Several hundreds of stalls and dozens of shops have been razed down in an inferno at the Ika Ika Oqua multipurpose market in Calabar, Cross River State capital. The market popularly referred to as the Marian market, is located less than five meters away from the Calabar Municipal council secretariat and 3.8km from the U. J Esuene sports stadium. An eyewitness who gave his name as Michael Etim said the fire incident occurred at about 9:00pm on Friday and alleged that an electrical power surge may have triggered a spark in a barber’s shop located near the axis of fruit shops. Sources further alleged that the Cross River State fire service arrived the scene 90 minutes later after initial reports suggested they had no Automobile Gas Oil (AGO) popularly called diesel, to fuel their trucks. The traders may have to count their losses on Saturday morning as squads of the Nigerian Army 13 brigade were said to have prevented looting by hoodlums. At the time of filing this report, there were no casualties but properties worth several millions of naira were destroyed. When DAILY POST contacted the Public Relations Officer of the State Fire Service via phone on Saturday, Mr. Cletus Makpere did not pick his calls and the Permanent Secretary in charge of Security in the Governor’s office, Dr. Alfred Mboto too did not pick his calls.

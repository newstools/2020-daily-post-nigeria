Manchester United is ready to sell at least six players this summer transfer window, as it looks to fund a move for Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho. DAILY POST recalls that Man United remain favourite to agree to a deal for Sancho this summer. Dortmund has already told Man United to sign Sancho before August 10. Man United have seen their revenue streams hit hard because of the COVID-19 pandemic and will have less money to spend this summer. The Red Devils’ executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, is hoping he can sell some of the club’s fringe players to raise funds for Sancho, who has a £115million price tag on his head. According to the Athletic, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Alexis Sanchez, Marcos Rojo, Diogo Dalot and Jesse Lingard could all leave Old Trafford this summer. Smalling, Sanchez and Rojo are on loan at AS Roma, Inter Milan and Estudiantes respectively. Lingard, Dalot and Jones are not regular starters under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad.

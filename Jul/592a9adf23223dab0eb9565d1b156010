Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville has named five things the club must do to challenge Liverpool, Manchester City and others for the Premier League title next season. Man United finished third on the Premier League table this season behind Man City and champions Liverpool. But Neville believes Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer needs to sign a right-winger, centre-forward, left-back, goalkeeper and a centre-back in order to compete for the English top-flight league title next season. “He needs to spend, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and that’s not reckless, he needs to spend in the right way,” Neville said on his Sky Sports podcast. “There needs to be a right-winger, there needs to be a challenge for centre-forward, there needs to be a left-back. “There needs to be a challenge for the goalkeeper, and they need a centre-back. “They need a top centre-back who can bring that level of dominance to the defence like Van Dijk does for Liverpool like Kompany did for Man City,” he said. Neville added: “You look at every team that wins titles and they have a dominant centre-back and a great goalkeeper. “Alisson, (Virgil) van Dijk, (Vincent) Kompany and Ederson, John Terry at Chelsea, Jaap Stam and Steve Bruce, Sol Campbell, Tony Adams. “They have all got great centre-backs, and great goalkeepers and Manchester United need those things. “I think Harry Maguire has had a good season, but he needs a partner. “That’s not being fair on (Victor) Lindelof because he needs a partner as well. “They are both good defenders, but I think Manchester United need a centre-back as well.”

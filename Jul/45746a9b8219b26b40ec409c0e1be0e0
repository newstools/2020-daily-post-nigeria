Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has blamed his individual error and lack of defensive solidity for his side’s 2-1 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. It is a result that damaged the Gunners’ hopes of sealing a European place. Arsenal took the lead thanks to Alexandre Lacazette’s rasping drive, but a loose Sead Kolasinac pass, allowed Son Heung-Min to equalise soon after. Toby Alderweireld gave Spurs victory late on with a header from a corner. It also saw Arteta lose his first North London derby as a manager. “We gave them the game again, an individual error and the set-piece that cost us three points again. “We talked about it before the game today that set-pieces in this game are crucial, and today it cost us the three points,” he said.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has insisted that he has huge respect for Arsenal defender, David Luiz because the Brazilian was a top player during his time at the Blues in 2012. Lampard, who played alongside Luiz at Chelsea, said this on Friday at his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s FA Cup final clash with Mikel Arteta’s side on Saturday at Wembley Stadium. Chelsea head to the game after defeating Manchester United 3-1 in the FA Cup semi-final a few days ago, while Arsenal won Pep Guardiola’s side 2-0. “No, [David] Luiz, is not a weak link, absolutely not,” Lampard said. “I have huge respect for David, he was a top player in our 2012 campaign, and I know what a big player he can be for Arsenal.” Luiz, 33, joined Arsenal last summer from Chelsea for £8million. The former Paris Saint-German centre-back recently signed a one-year new contract extension with Arsenal.

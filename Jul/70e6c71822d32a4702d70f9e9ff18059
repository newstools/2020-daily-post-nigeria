The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, has rubbished claims by Chief Olusola Oke, one of the governorship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, that he approached him to step down ahead of the elections. Oke made the remarks after submitting his nomination and declaration of interest forms in Abuja. According to the controversial Unity Forum candidate, he has been “reaching out” to Akeredolu, to try and convince him to step down. However, Akeredolu’s Senior Special Assistant on Special Duties and Strategy, Doyin Odebowale, on Saturday said Oke made such statement to attract sympathy. Odebowale said: “It is laughable to see a man who rejoined the APC after suffering the most crushing defeat in the last gubernatorial election in the state, boast of his political stature necessitating exigent intervention. “It is sad indeed that the man who alleged that he lost the gubernatorial primaries in 2016 because of phantom 300 votes allegedly given to an opponent and the eventual winner could not use his popularity to win on another political platform, the moribund Alliance for Democracy, (AD), resuscitated to promote treachery.” Odebowale added that unlike Akeredolu who won the 2016 election, Oke only “flaunts some specious credentials of service won in two local government areas in 2012 and 2016.” He then made it clear Akeredolu will be seeking the support of the people of Ondo State to serve again. Governor Akeredolu is currently recovering from COVID-19 and has insisted he will not hand over to his deputy, Agboola Ajayi.

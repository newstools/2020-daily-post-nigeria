The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, has claimed he does not know about any contract allegedly awarded to the Chairman, House of Representatives Committees on Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Hon. Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo. Akpabio stated this on Monday, during the investigative hearing on the alleged N40 billion irregular expenditure in the NDDC. According to him, he was yet to see contract documents made to Tunji-Ojo’s company. “I am not sure if NDDC awarded any contract to the Chairman, House of Representatives Committee, Rep. Olubunmi Tunji-Ojo. “For me to say that, I need to see that contracts were awarded to his company; maybe the contract was awarded in the area where he comes from in Ondo,” Akpabio said. Tunji-Ojo has been accused of executing contracts by the Interim Management Committee of the NDDC. The lawmaker stepped aside as chairman of the committee today, to allow for a free and fair hearing and not to be a judge in his own case.

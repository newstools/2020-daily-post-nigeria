The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Lagos State Police Command has arrested nine members of the Eiye confraternity. They were tracked for taking out a rival cult member in May 2020. The recorded murder circulated on the internet. Nigeriaâ€™s Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, directed the Commissioner of Police in Lagos, Hakeem Odumosu, to apprehend them. In the footage, the cultists first asked the young man some questions before snuffing his life. Odumosu told newsmen that SARS operatives initially arrested one of the suspects, Francis Diamond aka Iron Man. He confessed to being among the gang and that he was the one who recorded the chilling video. Eight other members were later arrested. In custody are Olaitan Apanpa aka Emir/Armoured Tank, 31; Chidi Michael aka Jaaru, 25; Eno Sunday aka Covenant, 25; Saheed Gbadebo aka Sambo, 23. Others are Adepeju Azeez aka Aboki, 38; Samuel Ilesanmi aka Baba Obo; Omotosho Quadri, 25; and Moses Ogungbe, 28. Apanpa, it was revealed, pulled the trigger that killed the victim. They said the reason for their action was that the deceased participated in the elimination of one of their leaders at the University of Ibadan in early 2020. Police said the suspects were serial killers of rival cult members in Ikorodu and its environs. Detectives found that Gbadebo single-handedly killed two persons at Bayekun Street, Ikorodu and another five at Ajah. The gang members will be charged to court at the end of investigations.

Manchester City is set to win their battle to host Real Madrid in the Champions League at the Etihad Stadium next month, the UK Mirror reports. There are four Champions League last-16 ties to be completed, including City against Real. Pep Guardiolaâ€™s side lead 2-1 from the first leg in Spain. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, UEFA initially wanted those remaining games played in Lisbon, Portugal, where the tournament will be completed on a single-game knockout basis after the last 16. City have lobbied hard to preserve their home advantage, even though the game will be played behind closed doors. Real wants it to go ahead in Portugal, citing travel and health concerns. UEFA have now soft-pedalled and relaxed the quarantine rules, which means City are likely to be allowed to host the second leg, with the game set for August 7.

The World Health Organisation, WHO, has issued a warning to countries on the reopening of schools, amid the coronavirus pandemic. Dr Michael Ryan, a senior WHO official said reopening of schools should be based on data-driven COVID-19 public health strategies and not just political. The Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme stated this at a briefing in Geneva, Switzerland, NAN reports. Ryan said: “We can’t play Whack-a-mole. We need to be able to walk and chew gum at the same time”. He lamented that the issue of school reopening had become a “political football.” According to Ryan, such was not fair on children. “Decisions must be made on data, and an understanding of the risks. “There needs to be a sustained commitment on suppressing the virus. If we can suppress it, then, schools can open safely.”

The Government of Abia State has tentatively fixed August 10, 2020, for reopening of schools to enable students in exit classes prepare and write relevant examinations. The decision to reopen schools for graduating students was reached after a Stakeholders meeting, which was held by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu at Michael Okpara Auditorium of Government House Umuahia on Thursday. According to the Governor, the planned reopening is subject to verifiable compliance with all the proposed COVID-19 prevention and control measures agreed at the summit. DAILY POST recalls that this is coming after the Federal Government had approved the reopening of secondary schools across the country.

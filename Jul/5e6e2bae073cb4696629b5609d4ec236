Speaking, NDDC Acting Managing Director, Kemebradikumo Pondei, explained that the money was for COVID-19 relief. He said they had to “take care of the staff, who are also the representatives of the people from the nine states of the Niger Delta region”. Pondei noted that the money given to the police to buy the items was on request. “We work very closely with the police. Without them, we can’t work. A request from the Police high command was made to us and the management looked at it and approved.” Pondei added that the Police have not “given us the record of how the money was spent”.

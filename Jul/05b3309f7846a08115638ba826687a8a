The Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, was “not arrested” on Monday. According to the EFCC, he only honoured an invitation by a Presidential Panel reviewing the activities of the agency. The Head of Media, Dele Oyewale, said this in a statement on Monday. He said the review was held at the Banquet Hall wing of the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Oyewale explained that Magu “was served the invitation to the Panel, while on his way to the Force Headquarters, Abuja, for a meeting.” He insisted that the EFCC boss “was neither arrested nor forced to honour the invitation”. The spokesman disclosed that a member of EFCC legal team was also with Magu as he faced the panel. Magu was picked up by the Department of State Services (DSS) in Wuse and taken to the Villa.

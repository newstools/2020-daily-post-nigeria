Manchester United and Alexis Sanchez are at an impasse over his future at Old Trafford, the Daily Star reports. Sanchez spent this season on loan at Inter Milan under former Chelsea boss Antonio Conte. The Chilean forward is keen on a permanent move to the San Siro club, as he looks to resurrect his career. The 31-year-old joined United on a free from Arsenal in 2018 and has two years remaining on his £500,00-a-week deal. But the Red Devils are not prepared to sanction his sale, as they believe he could still have something to offer Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. Sanchez, however, no longer sees his future at United and has told club bosses that he wants to play his football elsewhere. Inter are prepared to pay £30m for Sanchez, provided he is prepared to take a pay cut.

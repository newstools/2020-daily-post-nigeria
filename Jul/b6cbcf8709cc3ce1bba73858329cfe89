The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Friday, presented another witness against Ismaila Mustapha, aka Mompha, before Justice A. M. Liman of the Federal High Court in Ikoyi, Lagos. EFCC is prosecuting Mompha alongside his company, Ismalob Global Investment Limited, on an amended 22-count charge. They border on cyber fraud and money laundering to the tune of N33billion. Prosecution counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, invited the 10th prosecution witness (Pw10), Alhaji Ahmadu Mohammed. Mohammed is Mompha’s uncle. Mohammed recalled that he and one other person are directors at Ismalob Global Investment Limited. He confirmed that Mompha was the sole signatory to the account of the company, domiciled in Fidelity Bank. Mompha’s shares in the company, Mohammed disclosed, are worth 600,000, while those of two other directors are worth 200,000 each. Ahmadu also told the court that his job was to buy the Euro equivalent of the money sent to Mompha and send back in cash to the recipient, on Mompha’s directives. The uncle further revealed that the company whose operations commenced in December, 2015, is not a registered bureau de change. On cross-examination, defence lawyer, Gboyega Oyewole SAN said there was no link between Ismalob Global Investment Limited and Mompha BDC. He insisted that the former is a separate company. Justice Liman adjourned till July 24, 2020 for hearing on an application filed by Mompha. He wants the release of his properties seized by the EFCC.

Alhaji Sani Dauda, proprietor of ASD Motors and principal witness in the case between Senator Shehu Sani and EFCC has told the court at the resumed trial on Tuesday that the $25,000 claim, which the accused was being prosecuted was on the advice of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). At the resumed hearing of the case before Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court 5 in Abuja, the proceedings were all about cross examination of evidences. Shehu Sani’s Counsel, Barrister Ibrahim Abdullahi insisted to know how much he gave the accused and for what purposes. Alhaji Sani Dauda, who testified through a female interpreter, became evasive at a point when he was confronted with a bill of quantity of a car he sold to the ex-lawmaker. The defence counsel further asked, if he gave Shehu Sani money to bribe the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission and the Chief Justice of the Federation and for what purposes, he said: “The amount was $13,000, but the $25,000 was forced on him by the EFCC operatives as exhibit against Mallam Shehu Sani.” He claimed: “Nobody was there when Shehu was given the $25,000 and no one was there when he refunded the money to him. “When the money was refunded to me EFCC said I must bring it, but I said no that I have recovered my money but they insisted I have been cheated that I should return the money to them.”

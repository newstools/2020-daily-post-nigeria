The federal government has inaugurated the governing councils of 13 federal universities. Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, during the inauguration in Abuja on Monday, charged the appointees to foster harmonious relationships. Adamu told them to respect the rule of law in the discharge of their duties and in the appointment of their officers. He advised them to block loopholes and create ideas that would shore up the Internally Generated Revenue of the universities. “You will have to block the loopholes where the IGR slides away,” he said.

Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, has rejoiced with Muslims faithful in the state and the country in general on the occasion of this year’s Ei-el-Kabir. The governor in a Sallah message issued on Friday and made available to DAILY POST in Damaturu called on Muslim faithful to internalize all the lessons of the period by inculcating the spirit of good neighbourliness, love, honesty, generosity, discipline and fear of Allah. The message read in part: “This act of worship which entails sacrifice of animals, symbolize our obedience to the teachings of Islam and seeking the pleasure of Allah who has endowed us with bountiful blessings. Qur’an Chapter 22 (Suratul Hajj) Verse 37 reads and I quote: “It is not their meat or their blood that reaches Allah; it is your piety that reaches Him”. “This occasion inculcates in us the spirit of good neighbourliness, love, honesty, generosity, discipline and above all fear of Allah in all our actions. We should also be inclined to mutual understanding, justice and kindness to followers of other religions for the attainment of a stronger and united country”. The governor stressed that in spite of some challenges, his administration will continue to remain focused and committed to uplifting the state. “As you are aware, we have embarked on numerous projects that could open opportunities for foreign and domestic investments in the State. We are also committed to providing basic infrastructure for speedy development of the state and to improve the lives of our people”, he noted. Governor Buni urged people in the state to continue to engage in activities that promote peaceful coexistence and, to support security operatives to improve on the relative peace and security the state is enjoying. “We should not forget to pray for a bumper harvest, good health and prosperity of our state and country,” he appealed.

Barcelona manager, Quique Setien, has insisted he did not feel criticised by Lionel Messi’s remarks, after the 2-1 shock defeat to Osasuna on Thursday. Speaking at a press conference on Saturday, Setien also made it clear he has not thought about resigning from the role. Messi labelled Barca “inconsistent” and “weak” in an angry interview, after Real Madrid were crowned Spanish champions for the first time since 2017. The Argentine superstar also said performances since January had been very bad. That comment was interpreted in many quarters as targeted at Setien, who replaced Ernesto Valverde at the beginning of 2020. “No, not at all,” Setien replied when asked if he felt singled out by Messi. “I think in certain moments we all say things that are interpreted badly. It’s the fruit of a moment of frustration. “Some things we agree on and other things we don’t. [Messi] is right to say that if we play as badly as we have done in some games, we won’t win anything. “But we have also played well in other games and, playing like that, we could win things. We have to be more consistent. If we manage to play as we did against Villarreal, we could win the Champions League.”

The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has told the All Progressives Congress, APC, to blame its immediate past National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole for presenting a candidate he confirmed had questionable character for the coming governorship election in Edo State. PDP said APC should also hold Oshiomhole responsible for indicting its governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu as a “fake pastor.” Following the emergence of Ize-Iyamu as APC’s governorship candidate, past videos have emerged online of Oshiomole rubbishing and making damaging claims against him. The viral online videos were taken during the last governorship election in Edo State when Ize-Iyamu was the candidate of the PDP and Governor Godwin Obaseki was a member of the APC. While Ize-Iyamu had defected to APC, Obaseki had also teamed up with PDP, ahead of the September 19, governorship election. However, PDP’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan in a statement said: “The APC should blame themselves for presenting a candidate who was exposed by their party’s former National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, as a person of questionable character, a treasury looter, acid bather, rusticated student; a politician, who is only good for “night meetings” and unfit to hold office as governor of Edo State. “The APC should also hold Oshiomhole responsible for indicting its candidate as a “fake pastor” that started carrying the Holy Bible because he could not practice as a barrister. “It is indeed disgraceful that days to the election, all the APC has to offer is blackmail against our leaders, after its plans to derail the election has been exposed.”

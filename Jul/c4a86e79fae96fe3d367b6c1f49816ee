The Federal Government has clarified that it has not approved the extension of service for any officer in the public service due for retirement in 2020. This was contained in a statement on Monday by Olawunmi Ogunmosunle, Director, Information, Head of Civil Service of the Federation (HOCSF) office. The HOSCF, Folasade Yemi-Esan, was quoted as saying that no such circular emanated from her office. The statement told Nigerians that the purported circular is fake and incorrect. It explained that the letterhead used for the circular titled “Roll-over service for those due to retire within the COVID-19 era in 2020”, and dated July 13, 2020, is not the letter-head of the HOCSF. It noted that the outline of the entire circular, arrangement of the sections and the grammar were completely out of sync with the way genuine circulars are issued. The government added that the Director overseeing office of the Permanent Secretary, Career Management, never issued or signed any such letter. Yemi-Esan appealed to public servants and the public to be wary of deception. She advised citizens to always visit the governments official website regularly to cross-check circulars and other information.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Nengi, has revealed when she started smoking weed. The 22-year-old beauty queen on Thursday, said she started smoking weed when she lost her mum in order for her to get her mind off it. According to her, weed helps you forget stuff. Nengi revealed this during a conversation with fellow housemate, Tochi. “Most people don’t really understand, there are some things that would happen to you that you just need to get your mind off it. “When I lost my mum, that was when I started smoking weed, because I just want to forget, you know weed helps you forget and stuff.” She, however, added that she stopped smoking after a while because she had Ulcer. “Ulcer helped me to stop smoking,” Nengi added. #Nengi tells #Tochi why she started smoking weed #BBNaija #bbnaija2020 #BBNaijaLockdown pic.twitter.com/s2VrmWVenQ — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) July 30, 2020

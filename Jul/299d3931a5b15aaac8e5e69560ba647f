Former military Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, has urged the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, to pray for President Muhammadu Buhari. Gowon explained that Buhari needs prayers so that Nigeria won’t go asunder under his leadership. He made the appeal during the thanksgiving service and reception organized by CAN in honour of the newly appointed Executive Secretary, Nigerian Christian Pilgrim Commission (NCPC), Rev. Yakubu Pam IN Abuja. Represented by the Minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, the former military ruler alleged that some people with sinister motives, who wouldn’t want peace to reign in the country, hence the need for prayers. He said: “This commission is crucial and sensitive as one of the agencies of government. “You are coming into the office at a time that we have very serious security challenges. We have made a lot of efforts to solve these problems along with people of other religion. “We need peace to succeed. I know President Muhammadu Buhari is doing a lot but the challenges are still there. There are people with sinister motives, who wouldn’t want peace. But through prayers, I appeal to CAN to continue to pray not only for Yakubu Pam but for the president and all of us, and for your dear country, so that Nigeria will not go asunder.”

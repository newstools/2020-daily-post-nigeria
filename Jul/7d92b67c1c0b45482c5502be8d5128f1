A thirty-year-old man identified as Musa Abubakar Babangida is being Investigated at the State Criminal Investigation Department of Rivers State Police Command for alleged defilement of his nine-year-old step-daughter. Speaking to newsmen at the State CID, Port Harcourt, Musa while admitting to the crime, blamed his act on his wife who starves him of sex. “I am here because my wife reported me to the Police that I have been sleeping with her daughter. I touch the girl because my wife does not allow me to near her. “Anytime I want to touch my wife, she will say she is tired,” Musa said. The nine-year-old minor while narrating her ordeal in the hands of her step-father said Musa started defiling her at the age of four with the use of his finger. The little girl further explained that she was afraid to tell her mother of her ordeal. According to the minor, (name withheld), “When my mother brought me to Port Harcourt, I was 3 years old going to 4. Anytime my mother is not around, my daddy uses his finger to touch my vagina. “When I tell my mummy she will tell me to shut up that why am I lying against my daddy. My daddy will deny and swear with his life that he does not touch me. “But he continued till now that I am 9 years old when he started using his manhood to touch my vagina. I could not tell my mummy because she would shout at me. “But my mummy noticed when she wanted to bathe me. She said my body was changing, that what is happening to me. I could not tell her but she begged and begged, I now told her that daddy has been touching my vagina.” The Rivers State Police Command says Musa will be prosecuted in court soon.

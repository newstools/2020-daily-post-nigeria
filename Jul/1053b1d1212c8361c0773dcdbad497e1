Local Government Chairmen who were asked to leave their respective councils by Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State said the judgement by a Court of Appeal in Ibadan is against the ruling of the Supreme Court on local government areas. DAILY POST recalls that a Federal Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan, had on Wednesday ruled in favour of the Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde who in May 2019 sacked the former council bosses. The former council bosses were elected in 2018 during the administration of the immediate past Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi. A Federal Court of Appeal sitting in Ibadan, the state capital, however, on Wednesday ruled against the former Chairmen. But, Chairman of the dissolved Association of Local Government of Nigeria (ALGON), Prince Ayodeji Abass-Aleshinloye while reacting insisted that the judgement of the Appeal Court has negated the ruling of the Supreme Court on local government. Abass-Aleshinloye while speaking with DAILY POST in Ibadan, said the judge did not say that they were not elected. He maintained that he and his colleagues have concluded plans to challenge the ruling at the Supreme Court. He assured that there is no need for apprehension as he urged the people of the state to remain calm. “There is no need for apprehension. It is not about the office that matters, it is the democracy. What we are doing is to strengthen our democracy. “The appeal Court judgement goes against the Supreme Court judgement. The judgement did not say that we were not elected. There are some issues the Appeal Court did not attend to. That is why I said that the judgement is against the Supreme court judgement on Local Government. “We are going to the highest Court in the land. What I am saying, in essence, is that we are going to the Supreme Court. Of course, we will get a judgement. It is not about the office. I feel sorry for this state. These are the people that cannot obey simple court judgement.

Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho has promised that he is going to do everything possible to give the club’s fans a good campaign next season. This came after they sealed Europa League qualification with a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Sunday. He also revealed that Tottenham will keep their best players next season and will improve the squad, adding that Spurs will not sign ten players or buy players for £100million. Mourinho’s side finished sixth position on the Premier League table above Wolves on goal difference, thanks to Harry Kane’s lone goal in their draw against Crystal Palace. “What we can do of course is improve,” Mourinho told Sky Sports. “When all the players are available, we showed in this last period where we belong. I do not know, and maybe in this period, after lockdown, we finished third or fourth in the table. “So that is where we belong. I want to have my team, my players, not a medical room full of players. I want a pitch full of players. “Of course as a squad, the main thing is to keep our very good players and after that improve the squad. “Are we going to buy ten players? No. Are we going to buy players for £100m? No. We’re going to improve. “I enjoy working with Steve (Hitchen – Spurs’ chief scout) in this organisation. We are very connected with (chairman) Mr (Daniel) Levy and the board, and we are going to do what is possible to do, and hopefully next season we can give it to the fans a very good season.” He added: “I think the players deserve it. “Of course everybody that one day plays Champions League does not want to go back and play Europa League but (it) was the only thing possible after such a difficult season for the club, for the players and in my case also for me.”

The Zamfara State government has not been able to explain how much the state government has spent on coronavirus expenses. An APC chieftain, Mallam Ibrahim Gusau has made this claim. In an exclusive interview with DAILY POST, Gusau said Hon. Nasiru Mayarta was not able to explain the total amount spent on coronavirus pandemic in the state. “We are citizens of the state and deserve to know how much the state government has spent on coronavirus. The issue is not party politics but pure administrative issue, ” he lamented. Mallam Gusau maintained that no government can succeed without the cooperation of the citizens. “I’m not saying this simply because I am an APC member but because I am a true citizen of the country, ” he said. “You are a Nigerian journalist and I am very sure that you can never say confidently how much the state government has spent on coronavirus” He, therefore, called on the state government to quickly publish the amount spent on coronavirus so that the people of the state can know how their money is being spent on their behalf. “This money belongs to all the citizens of this state and not a few individuals that are opportunists, therefore, we must remain the voice of the common man who is voiceless irrespective of what it takes. “I don’t want to join issues with premature politicians even though they are the government.” The politician maintained that party politics is not what the state needs now but capital development, saying that there is no way any society can develop without any opposition.

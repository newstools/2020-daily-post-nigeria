The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday stated that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was jittery ahead of the September 19 governorship election in Edo State. The party accused the PDP of deploying “their usual, diversionary, baseless and theatrical allegations”. A statement on Friday by Yekini Nabena, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, said “PDP is intimidated by the quality, depth and political sagacity of the APC National Campaign Council.” He boasted that the APC had a formidable campaign structure to ensure Osagie Ize-Iyamu wins the poll. The party noted that it has no interest in rolling in the mud with the PDP or engaging them “in their senseless and drunken tirade.” He said Edo state is not dubbed the Heartbeat of the Nation for nothing. Nabena told the PDP that Edo electorate was sensible, sophisticated and progressive. “The focus of the APC is to display to the Edo electorate our pro-people credentials, infrastructure/development track record, social investments, wealth creation initiatives, among others. “APC is a party that fiercely advocates, practices and defends the principle of “One person, one vote”. Come September 19 every valid vote must count.” The spokesman urged the PDP to concentrate on its “deadbeat and empty campaign instead of the comic it has turned itself to.”

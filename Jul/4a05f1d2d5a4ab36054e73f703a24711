Nigeria’s Kamaru Usman has been given a six-month medical suspension, after breaking his nose against Jorge Masvidal during his UFC 251 welterweight fight, SportingLife reports. Nicknamed ‘The Nigerian Nightmare’, Usman suffered a broken nose as he retained his UFC welterweight title last weekend. The 33-year-old is now set to miss six months of action. Usman will also avoid any contact for at least three weeks while the nose heals. Masvidal himself will miss a month, due to a forehead laceration sustained during his defeat. The American took the fight on just six days’ notice, but failed to pull off a shock win. Masvidal has now been handed a 30-day medical suspension.

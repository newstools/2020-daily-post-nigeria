I love you forever my baby. “My partner. Here’s to our future!!!!” See pictures below…<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-820097" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/engaged.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="1551" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/engaged.jpg 1242w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/engaged-240x300.jpg 240w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/engaged-820x1024.jpg 820w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/engaged-1230x1536.jpg 1230w" sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-820098" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/post.jpg" alt="" width="1242" height="860" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/post.jpg 1242w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/post-300x208.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/post-1024x709.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1242px) 100vw, 1242px">

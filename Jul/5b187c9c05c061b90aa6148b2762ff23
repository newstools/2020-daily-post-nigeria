Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, has insisted that his principal is not against the Igbo of the South East region. Adesina, in his weekly column titled ‘Buhari & S’East: Arthur Eze nails it,’ said that the President, within his 5 years in office, has funded “69 different projects being undertaken by the Federal Government in South East alone, all amounting to about N680 billion.” Adesina said that despite getting the list votes from the South East in 2015 and 2019, Buhari has spearheaded massive revolution of the region. He also pointed out that for his love for the South East, Buhari his running mate in 2007 presidential election was former Speaker, House of Representatives, Chief Edwin Ume-Ezeoke after he had picked the late Chuba Okadigbo in 2003 for the same purpose. The presidential aide recalled that when former Vice President, Dr Alex Ekwueme fell ill, “President Buhari arranged his evacuation abroad by air ambulance. When he eventually passed on, he was given a most befitting national burial. Do you do that for people you don’t like? Hardly.” Adesina said that Buhari is a man that “gives every man his due, every region what they deserve. Fairness to all.” He, lamented that revisionists are in their game of making the people believe that Buhari is “nepotistic, myopic, insular, and who would never appoint a non-Fulani into any position of substance.”

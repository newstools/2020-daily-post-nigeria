The Ikeja Electricity Distribution Company, IKEDC, has paid N250,000 for the burial expenses of the late Taiwo Akinlusi, the goalkeeper of the Ejigbo All Stars Football Club who was electrocuted to death at a betting shop at Eko Akete Plaza, two weeks ago. It also offered to pay the sum of N1, 500,000 to the family as compensation. DAILY POST had reported that the bereaved family and IKEDC agreed to meet and discuss on the compensation to be given to the family by the company. IKEDC made the offers when both parties resumed discussion on Monday, explaining that the offer was the standard practice of the company in such circumstances. However, while the family accepted the amount offered for the burial, it asked to defer the discussion on the compensation till after the burial. The family was represented in the discussion by the secretary of the Community Development Committee of Ejigbo LCDA, Barr. Bimbo Olawale. From the mood of the representative of the family, the compensation was considered too low to give the wife and children a fresh start in coping with the challenges of living. Akinlusi is survived by his wife, Christiana Titilayo Akinlusi and three children â€“Adesewa, Olawale and Oluwatimilehin. The burial programme is scheduled to start with the wake-keep at No 2, Fehintolu Street, Ejigbo, Lagos on Thursday, July 23. On Friday, there will be a burial service at the same place before the remains of the late goalkeeper will be interned at Atan- Ayobo cemetery in Ayobo, in line with the COVID-19 regulations.

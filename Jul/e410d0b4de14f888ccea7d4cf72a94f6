Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu has inaugurated the State Advisory Community Policing Committee with a charge to the members to be careful about the individuals they nominate into the Committee. Inaugurating the Committee in Umuahia on Wednesday, Governor Ikpeazu said this was to ensure that only those with proven character were selected. He described the inauguration of the Abia state Advisory Community Policing Committee as a milestone in the stateâ€™s journey towards protecting its citizens and communities, adding that essence of Community Policing was essentially to ask the people to do the needful through active participation in their own protection from criminals. Ikpeazu noted that communities had for too long left the issue of security solely in the hands of the police, pointing out that Abia was now creating a platform for effective collaboration between the police and the citizens.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-822694" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/D1B9FFE5-0200-4E84-989E-85E347DD5B07.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/D1B9FFE5-0200-4E84-989E-85E347DD5B07.jpeg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/D1B9FFE5-0200-4E84-989E-85E347DD5B07-300x200.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> He stressed that it was the duty of the citizens to provide authentic information to the police and thanked the Inspector General of Police, IGP, for his vision in establishing community policing.

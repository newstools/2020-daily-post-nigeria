Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has said referees should be made to pay for their “disgraceful decisions”. Mourinho was angry after Harry Kane did not get a penalty at Bournemouth during their 0-0 draw in the Premier League on Thursday. Michael Oliver, who was the VAR official on duty that night, is the referee for Sunday’s North London derby against Arsenal. Mourinho said: “I think you should have access to them, I know the rules don’t allow it. I think you should have access to them – to ask directly why. “It’s very important. I think they are very important in the game, as important as players. “It would stop nothing but would make things much more open, much more clear. It would give the referee the opportunity to say ‘Yes, I made a mistake – I feel sorry for that’ or ‘Yes I had incredible performance’ or ‘yes I was perfect.’

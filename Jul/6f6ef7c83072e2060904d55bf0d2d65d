Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that midfield maestro, N’Golo Kante, will miss the Blues’ FA Cup semi-final tie against Manchester United on Sunday evening due to injury. Recall that Kante sustained a tight hamstring during Chelsea’s Premier League 3-0 victory against Watford earlier this month. But Lampard believes the France international is not match-fit to feature against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side at the Wembley Stadium. Chelsea goes into the fixture after defeating Norwich City 1-0 in the Premier League in their last game, while Man United won 2-0 against Crystal Palace. “The squad is okay, but N’Golo Kante won’t be fit for the match,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “He is still not right, so he is out. “Other than that, we have a few players with a few little niggles which we will monitor over the next 24 hours, and then we will be ready to go.” The match is scheduled at 6 pm.

The Abia State police command said it has begun manhunt for the remaining nine out of the 29 criminal suspects that escaped from police cell in Umuahia on Saturday. The Police Public Relations Officer for Abia Command, SP Geoffrey Ogbonna, who confirmed the incident to newsmen on Monday said that the 29 detainees escaped from the Umuahia Central Police Station’s cell after overpowering the guard on duty. According to him, one of the detainees had appealed to the guard (name withheld) to assist him with water to flush the toilet. “Unknown to the guard, the detainees had conspired to attack him in order to escape from detention.
“This happened around 9.00 p.m. on Saturday,’’ he said. He further explained that as soon as the guard brought the water and opened the iron bar, the suspects rushed out, overpowered him and took to their heels. The command’s spokesman also stated that 20 of the suspects were rearrested that night and in the early hours of Sunday. “I appeal to members of the public to be vigilant and report any strange face or faces in dirty attires in their neighborhood to the police. “The suspects had dirty attires they wore in the cell and may be looking for where to steal people’s clothes in order to look decent to be able to escape from the town,’’ he added. He expressed confidence that the remaining nine escapees would be rearrested, NAN reports.

The Chairman, Medical Advisory Committee on COVID-19 in Kwara State, Femi Oladiji, has said only those with symptoms of COVID-19 can be isolated at the isolation centre. Oladiji disclosed that the government has changed its strategy hence those who are asymptomatic can self isolate at home. He disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Ilorin. “We have changed our strategy; so it is only when you have symptoms that you can visit us, if you don’t have symptoms, you self isolate at home,” Oladiji said.
He added that an holding area at the Sobi Isolation Centre provides a walk in free testing facility in addition to that of the Ministry of Health.
“This testing contributed to the sudden surge in Kwara as people are now more conscious and more aware.
“We usually announce that you can get tested at will free of charge,” Oladiji said. He warned Nigerians to stop being lackadaisical about the virus in Nigeria, mentioning that COVID-19 is now on its rampaging run.
“I laugh at ignorance of some people to the virus especially when they say the state is just increasing the numbers to get more money.
“As I speak to you, two people are on danger list and we are praying that they survive. ”Our people should stop being ignorant and believe that Coronavirus is real,” Oladiji added.

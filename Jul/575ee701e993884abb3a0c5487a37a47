The founder of Divine Hand of God Prophetic Ministries International in Abuja, Emmanuel Omale, has threatened to file a suit against the News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, for claiming that he helped the suspended acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, acquire a property in Dubai. NAN had published a report of the Presidential Committee on Audit of Recovered Assets (PCARA), which probed assets recovered by the EFCC from May 2015 to May 2020. Part of the report claimed Magu allegedly used Omale to buy a landed property worth N573million in Dubai, UAE. But in a letter by his lawyer, Gordy Uche (SAN), Omale described the report as malicious, derogatory and libellous. He said it “reeks of calumny, denigration, actuated by malice, and calculated to ridicule and disparage him, and clearly a hatchet job ingeniously crafted to cast a stain on his reputation.” Omale denied owning any foreign bank account or property anywhere in the world. “That our client does not own any property in Dubai. His name was never used to purchase any property whatsoever in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates or anywhere else in any part of the world, neither has he purchased any property or properties for Mr. Ibrahim Magu in any part of the world whatsoever,” it added. Omale further demanded an immediate apology and retraction from NAN.

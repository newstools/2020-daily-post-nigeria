The Ebonyi State Police Command yesterday said it has rearrested over 17 freed inmates for committing various heinous crimes in the state. The command who spoke to DAILY POST in Abakaliki through the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, DSP Loveth Odah lamented that the suspects have been terrorizing innocent citizens of the state, since they were freed from the prisons. According to her: “We have been suffering since after the jail delivery that was done in Abakaliki Prisons, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. “I contacted my counter-parts in Abakaliki Prisons and she said that the capacity of Abakaliki prisons is 387 inmates but it is currently overcrowded with over one thousand inmates. “And it is because of that condition that they had to decongest the prison as a way of maintaining social distance. “And so, after the jail delivery and instead of the inmates finding something to do for themselves, many of them have decided to rob Churches. “They are the ones committing these crimes. And I tell you, we have rearrested more than 17 of them and taken back to the prisons. “People were surprised that we charged to court a boy that stole N10 from Church. The item stolen is not the case but the act of stealing. It is not because the boy stole alone but for the courage to enter inside the church of God to steal when others are there to worship God.

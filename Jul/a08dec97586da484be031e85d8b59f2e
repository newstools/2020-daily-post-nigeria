The All Progressives Congress (APC) has advised Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to carry party members along ahead of the governorship election on October 10. The party said this on Tuesday in a congratulatory message to Akeredolu on his victory at the primary. Akeredolu polled 2,458 votes to defeat other contestants. Four stepped down for him. Alex Kalejaiye, Publicity Secretary, in a statement, thanked aspirants who endorsed the governor before the primary. He said the gesture was a display of their interest and love for the party. Noting that only one candidate emerged, the spokesman said the APC sees Akeredolu’s emergence as a collective victory for the state chapter. “We urge him to accommodate all tendencies within the fold. We will soon hold a “family” meeting and fashion out plausible approaches to electoral victory come October,” Kalejaiye disclosed. However, APC urged members not to be carried away. It urged that all hands be on deck to ensure a big win at the poll.

Three kidnappers were on Saturday morning killed in a gun battle with hunters along Okene/Lokoja highway. It was gathered that the bandits were planning to stage an attack on innocent citizens plying the road before they met their waterloo after two of their informants were arrested by hunters who were on patrol at about 4:30am. The two informants arrested were identified as Mr Godwin Peter a native of Ikeje in Olamaboro Local Government Area and one Sanni Habib, a native of Idoji in Okene Local Government Area. The Senior Special Adviser (SSA) Security in charge of Okehi Local Government Area, Hon Abdulraheem Ohiare and his Adavi counterpart, Hon Joseph Omuya Salami, had led the hunters to the hideouts of the kidnappers following an intelligence report. The Senior Special Adviser (SSA) Security in charge of Adavi Local Government Area Joseph Omuya Salami told our correspondent on Saturday that, “upon getting to their hideouts, which was led by my self and my Okehi colleague, the hunters engaged the kidnappers in a gun battle during which three of them were gunned down while others escaped with gunshots wounds. “Upon interrogation, the suspects both confessed that they were informants who gave information to kidnappers for their operations”. DAILY POST learned that three sophisticated pump action rifles, bullets, masks and charms were recovered from the kidnappers. The Kogi State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP, William Aya could not confirm the incident as at the time of filing this report as he failed to pick calls or respond to text messages put across to him by DAILY POST on Saturday afternoon.

Former Liverpool defender, Jamie Carragher, has advised Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, to get rid of goalkeeper, Kepa Arizzabalaga and his back three defenders, Antonio Rudiger, Kurt Zouma and Cesar Azpilicueta following the Blues’ Premier League 5-3 defeat to the Reds on Wednesday night. Carragher also urged Lampard to sign a new defender this summer transfer window in a bid to challenge Liverpool and Manchester City for next season’s Premier League title. Liverpool defeated Chelsea at Anfield, thanks to goals from Naby Keita, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Gini Wijnaldum and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain. Olivier Giroud, Tammy Abraham and Christian Pulisic did score for Lampard’s side. “Chelsea won’t go further unless they change their goalkeeper, Kepa,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “Going back to how important goalkeepers are I look at this Chelsea team, and there’s a lot I like about it, it does remind me in a lot of ways of the position Jurgen Klopp was in a couple of years ago. “He’s done as much as he can, yes Frank’s still in his early stages, but those big signings can completely transform you as a team. “I still think Chelsea need a defender. You see how many goals they’ve conceded. I think a lot of that is down to the goalkeeper being totally honest. “You see a lot of centre-halves at Chelsea without seeing one really outstanding one, those are the areas that if they are going to challenge Liverpool and Man City, they will have to rectify in the summer. “They are the worst team in the league defending corners. This is a massive problem for Chelsea. Yes, Werner is coming in and the lad from Ajax, there is talk of Havertz as well. “It sounds great, and it gets supporters excited, but it means nothing if you don’t sort out that back three and certainly that goalkeeper [Kepa].”

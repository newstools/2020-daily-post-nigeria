A former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has advised the club on signing Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho. Man United remain favourite to agree to a deal for Sancho this summer transfer’s window. Dortmund have already told the Red Devils to sign Sancho before August 10. But Berbatov believes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side do not ‘necessary’ need to sign the 20-year-old England international because of their present front three, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood. “Looking at how the Man United squad are doing at the moment I do not think signing Sancho is necessary,” the Bulgarian told the Daily Mirror. “Look at the front three from the other night, the speed of Martial, Rashford and Greenwood was great to watch, their link-up play was fantastic. “Football is a funny thing, you have a great young player in Sancho, but at the same time, you have a great young player in Greenwood. “Man United have to question if they are ready to sacrifice and halt the development of Greenwood, one of their own, to bring Sancho in.”

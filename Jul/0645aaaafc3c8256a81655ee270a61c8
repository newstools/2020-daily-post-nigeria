No fewer than 106 members of the Action Democratic Party (ADP) on Tuesday defected to the People Democratic Party, PDP in Edo State. The ADP defectors are from Egor, Ovia South West and Ovia North East Local Government Areas of Edo. According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Mr. Oshodin Izedomwen, the Organising Secretary of the ADP in Edo, who led the defectors, said they defected because they believe in the capacity of the PDP. He stated that he left the party because some “strange bedfellows” came to join the PDP. Izedomwen said that other defectors and himself had now returned to the PDP because the “strange bedfellows had since left the party. “In politics, interest matters because it is always the driving force,” he added. The Edo State Chairman of the PDP, Dr Tony Aziegbemi, who received the defectors expressed delight over their action. Aziegbemi while assuring them that they would be integrated into the PDP to contribute to the success of the party in the state, described the action of the new party members and their leader as a homecoming.

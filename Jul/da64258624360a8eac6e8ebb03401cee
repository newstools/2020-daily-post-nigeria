In a tweet on his verified Twitter handle, Buhari wrote: “I observed the Eid-El-Kabir prayers at home with my family, this morning, in keeping with the advisories from the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs. Once again I wish us all a safe and happy Eid. #EidMubarak.” Recall that Buhari had some days ago disclosed that he would observe the Eid El-Kabir prayers with his family at home. In a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, Buhari had said he won’t be receiving visitors who usually troop to the Presidential Villa to pay Sallah homage. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-823153 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/buhari-sallah2-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="494" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/buhari-sallah2-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/buhari-sallah2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/buhari-sallah2.jpg 1500w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

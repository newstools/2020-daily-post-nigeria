Real Madrid have clinched their 34th LaLiga title. Karim Benzema scored both goals as Los Blancos beat Villarreal 2-1 on Thursday night. Although Vicente Iborra pulled one back for the Yellow Submarine and Marco Asensio saw a goal ruled out for handball, Zinedine Zidane’s men held on for an important win. It was their 10th successive victory at home to Villarreal and Zidane’s second league title as manager in his third spell at the club, having returned last March. With only one round of matches left to play, Madrid went seven points clear at the top of the table ahead of Barcelona, who were beaten 2-1 by Osasuna at the Nou Camp. Real Madrid have wrestled back the title for the first time in two years, after winning all 10 league games and scoring 19 goals while keeping six clean sheets, conceding just four after the COVID-19 lockdown.

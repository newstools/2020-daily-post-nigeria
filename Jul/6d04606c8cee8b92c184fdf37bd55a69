The Defence Headquarters has disclosed that the Air Component of Operation Hadarin Daji has neutralized some notorious bandits in an airstrike in Kagara Forest, Zamfara State. It also said that troops of Operation Thunder Strike under the subsidiary Operation Accord, rescued three kidnapped victims from bandits at Chikun in Kaduna State. Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, in a statement on Friday in Abuja, stated that the feat was achieved on July 9, after intelligence reports. He said: “Some notable armed bandit leaders and several of their fighters have been neutralized in airstrikes executed by the Air Component of Operation HADARIN DAJI in the Zamfara State section of the Kagara Forest. This was achieved on 9 July 2020 pursuant to Human Intelligence (HUMINT) reports indicating that some armed bandits had relocated with a large number of rustled livestock from the Sokoto State side of the Forest and set up camp in the Zamfara State portion of the Forest. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions also later confirmed the exact location of the camp. “Sequel to credible intelligence on the kidnap of some people by armed bandits from their farm in Gwazunu village, Chikun LGA of Kaduna State, troops of Operation THUNDER STRIKE under the subsidiary Operation ACCORD promptly deployed to the scene and engaged the bandits with effective firepower. The bandits escaped in disarray with gunshot wounds thereby abandoning the kidnapped victims. All the 3 victims were successfully rescued unhurt and have been reunited with their families. “The Military High Command congratulates the gallant troops for their dedication and unwavering commitment and urges them to remain committed and sustain the onslaught against the criminals.”

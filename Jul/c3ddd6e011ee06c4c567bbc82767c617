There was chaos at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos, after two airplanes collided on Wednesday. An Airbus A330-243 owned by Middle East Airlines with registration number OD-MEA, ran into a Boeing 777 airplane with registration number TC-LJC operated by Turkish Airlines. The Middle East airbus ran into the Turkish cargo flight, which was parked at the international airport apron, according to the Daily Sun. The Turkish cargo plane was said to be parked at the tarmac when the MEA airbus which was taxiing ran into it. The plane had to disembark its passengers who were already on board. Earlier this week, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, spoke about the efforts of the federal government towards the resumption of international flights in the country. Mustapha, who is also the Chairman of the Presidential Taskforce (PTF) on COVID-19, said talks are currently ongoing between PTF and the Aviation Ministry. While the Nigerian government gave a green light for the commencement of local flights, international flight was still restricted.

The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has sacked a Permanent Secretary, Sunny Okere, with immediate effect. Okere was fired for flouting and obstructing the enforcement of COVID-19 guidelines. This was contained in a statement signed by Rivers Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim. Wike made the decision public via a statewide broadcast on Wednesday. According to him, Okere chased away officials of the Ministry of Health, who went to Oyigbo to enforce the established guidelines on public burials. Wike said his action against the Permanent Secretary, would serve as a warning to other public officers. “Burial ceremonies are also reportedly being conducted in clear breach of the 50 persons maximum attendance limit such that a serving Permanent Secretary had the temerity to chase away officials of the State Ministry of Health who went to enforce the established guidelines on public burials at Oyigbo,” the statement read in part.

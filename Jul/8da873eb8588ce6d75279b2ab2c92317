Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has demanded his players stand up and be counted, ahead of a “critical time” in their top four pursuit. The pressure in the chase for Champions League football has been cranked up after Manchester City’s ban was overturned. The verdict means only a top four finish will guarantee a spot in Europe’s top club competition next season. Chelsea have their fate in their own hands with three games left, although the 3-0 defeat at Sheffield United on Saturday underlined issues that Lampard has detected throughout the season. Ahead of Norwich’s visit on Tuesday night, Lampard said: “I’ve got big personalities and there will be big personalities in the team. They need to stand up. “Show the quality they’ve shown for big parts of the season. I trust they will do and because we’re at the business end it’s very important that they do. It cannot be understated how big mentality is. “How big attitude is. When you talk about players it is very easy and natural to look at talent but you also have to look at attitude and character within the team. “We’re in a good place but it’s something we can improve.”

Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has said the party’s Edo State governorship candidate, Pastor Ize-Iyamu, will not repeat the mistakes of the incumbent, Godwin Obaseki. Oshiomhole stated this in Benin GRA in the State capital, while addressing APC members on Sunday. He admitted that he sold “a bad product” to the people in 2016. However, Oshiomhole made it clear that he supported Obaseki’s governorship aspiration, to ensure the continuity of his projects and programmes. “Obaseki is MoU (Memoranda of Understanding) governor, but Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu is a man of God, who will ensure good governance in Edo State from November 12 this year. “I have made my honest mistakes. Only God is perfect. I am now 68 years old. I have come to apologise for the mistake of supporting Obaseki in 2016. I am in Edo State to repair my mistakes. “Obaseki has abused the trust of Edo people. With our permanent voter cards, we shall punish Obaseki on September 19. Ize-Iyamu will not repeat the mistakes of Obaseki. Ize-Iyamu will take Edo State to the next level,” he said.

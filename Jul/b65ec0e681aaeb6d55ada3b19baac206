Most Muslims in Zamfara State may not celebrate the forthcoming Eid Kabir as expected following serious economic hardship, especially those with the civil service, DAILY POST has gathered. According to a civil servant, one Usman Abdulahi, the economic hardship is biting so hard that many civil servants cannot afford to buy ram for the Sallah celebration. “We are only existing, not living because there is abject poverty in the land due to serious economic doldrums ravaging the entire country,” he lamented. According to him, civil servants in the state are suffering serious economic hardship due to the dreaded coronavirus challenging the world, and claiming lives globally. When asked if he did not believe that the state government would pay July salary before the Sallah, he said that people should ask of how much is being paid to civil servants at the end of every month. “As I’m talking to you now, the state government has not implemented the approved N30,000 minimum wage which it said that the civil servants are entitled to” Speaking further, Abdulahi noted that as at press time, he has not purchased any ram for the Sallah even though this is a big Sallah that calls for big celebration, ”but how can anybody celebrate Eid-Kabir comfortably without money?” he asked. Continuing, Abdulahi noted that there are many civil servants that are indebted to banks due to one problem or the other, saying that the state government still remains their collateral in borrowing the money from the banks. “I am not saying that the state government has any fault in this but the government should understand the plight of the civil servants in the state”

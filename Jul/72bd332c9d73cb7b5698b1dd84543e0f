Manchester United midfielder, Nemanja Matic, has warned Chelsea and Leicester City that the Red Devils are still in charge of their Champions League fate. Matic said this following Man United’s 2-2 draw with Southampton in the Premier League on Monday night. Man United had the chance to move into third position on the Premier League table with a win against Southampton, but Michael Obafemi scored in the 96th minute at Old Trafford to ensure Leicester City and Chelsea remain in the final two Champions League spots. But Matic believes Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side deserve to be in the Champions League next season ahead of Chelsea and Leicester. “We have to keep our head up. We have three games to go. The next one is Crystal Palace on Thursday. If we win the last three games, we are in the Champions League,” Matic told MUTV. “We have to stay positive and keep working as we were until now. Everything is in our hands. It’s in our hands – we have to recover as soon as possible. “We have another game now against a very good team again, so we have to go with everything because we want to play in the Champions League next season. Matic added: “I think we deserve that, so I want to say we work positively, recover well and we will see on Thursday if we are ready. I am sure the team is ready. “Of course, three months ago, it was not in our hands. We needed Chelsea and Leicester to drop points, which they did obviously. Now we are a point behind Chelsea, and it’s in our hands. “We’ll take it game by game. We’ll think about the Palace game first, then see if we do our job there like we normally do.”

Gunmen at the early hours of Sunday abducted Juwairiyya Murtala, 17-years-old daughter of a member representing Danbatta Constituency in the Kano State House of Assembly, Murtala Musa Kore at his country home. Juwairiyya Murtala, an SS II student of Government Girls Secondary School, Jogana was reportedly seized in place of her father who wasn’t at home at the time of the incident. Multiple security sources claimed that armed men stormed the legislator’s home in Kore village, Danbatta local government area of Kano at around 2:00am to carry out the dastardly act. The visibly disturbed legislator while addressing journalists on the development said he was the target of the kidnapping gang who out of frustration seized his daughter. The lawmaker further revealed that “they told my wives and children that they were there to kidnap me and were not ready to leave empty-handed, and in fulfilment of their vow kidnapped my daughter instead of me.” Kore said “I was in Kano when I received a phone call from my country home by 2:30am and was intimated that kidnappers have abducted my daughter, Juwairiyya. Giving a graphic picture of the incident, Kore explained, “the abductors invaded my house and tied up my elder brother, Lawal Kore whom they had mistaken for me when he told them that I wasn’t home they went inside my family’s quarters to verify his claim. However, the legislator said the kidnappers are yet to contact him for ransom. Speaking on the situation in a telephone conversation, DSP Abdullahi Haruna failed to either confirm or deny the story, adding he was out of Kano metropolis on an equally important engagement. In his words “at the moment, we are at Falgore forest, and I’m hearing for the first time, and as soon as we return to Kano, I will make my enquiry and get back to you. “

The Kogi State government has said it is considering selling some non-performing assets of the state, to raise capital for infrastructural development. This was contained in a statement signed by the State Commissioner for Information and Communication, Kingsley Fanwo, on Wednesday. Fanwo noted that the government is also considering “divesting from business ventures.” Some businesses such as hotels and transportation will be ceded to the private sector. Fanwo noted that the Kogi State government is “evolving a policy to systematically ease herself out of business ventures that are not critical needs of the people and which could be better managed by the private sector. “The present administration is working on a plan to concentrate on infrastructural development and create a conducive environment for businesses to thrive,” he said. Fanwo added that the current realities demand that the state reorders its priorities and look into how ongoing projects can be completed as well as initiate new and impactful ones.

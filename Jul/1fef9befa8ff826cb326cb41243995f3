Lagos Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LAMATA) has increased bus fares on the routes operated by the Lagos Bus Services Limited (LBSL). The increment reflects an average of 46 percent. LAMATA spokesman, Kolawole Ojelabi, made the announcement in a statement on Tuesday. The new rates take effect from August 1. He confirmed that Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu approved the review following a plea by the operating company. The firm cited the need to sustain its operation due to the negative effect of coronavirus on public transportation. Ojelabi said Sanwo-Olu also approved LBSLâ€™s request to increase the number of passengers per bus from 20 to 42 in observance of updated COVID-19 protocol. He added that the governor granted LBSL buses permission to access dedicated lanes for BRT.

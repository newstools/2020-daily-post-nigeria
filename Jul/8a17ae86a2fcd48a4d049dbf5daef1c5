Youths of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Wednesday descended on four persons allegedly caught thumb printing ballot papers during the party primary election. The four suspects were later dragged to the police station. Accreditation of delegates was yet to begin when the youths raised the alarm. However, it was discovered that the thumb-printed ballot papers with the suspects were just specimen used for training and enlightenment by some aspirants. The voting process commenced shortly after the 2,111 delegates across the 18 local government areas of the state had been accredited. As at press time, only three local governments, Ondo West, Ondo East and Ose had voted with 15 more to go.

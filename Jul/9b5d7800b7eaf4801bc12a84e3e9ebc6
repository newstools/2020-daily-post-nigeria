Former Kogi West lawmaker, Dino Melaye, has reacted to calls for his probe, over alleged association with fraudster, Hushpuppi. Recall that the All Progressives Congress, APC, over the weekend called for the probe of some Peoples Democratic Party leaders over their alleged links to suspected fraudster, Ramond Abbas popularly known as Hushpuppi. APC’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena in a statement said Atiku Abubakar, Bukola Saraki and former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara; and ex-Kogi West Senator, Dino Melaye should be probed over their association with Hushpuppi. Reacting, Melaye on to his official Twitter page said he would not glorify the ruling party, APC, with a response over claims of his affiliation with Hushpuppi. His post reads: “I will not glorify a religiously lunatic character nor the caretaker party (APC) with a response on Hushpuppy.” Hushpuppi was recently arrested in the United Arab Emirates and extradited to the United States. He and his friend Olakekan Jacob popularly known as Woodberry are facing criminal charges for conspiracy to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from business email compromise (BEC) frauds and other scams. Also, Bukola Saraki and Atiku Abubakar have denied association with Hushpuppi. Saraki warned the APC leadership to compel Yekini Nabena to desist from making and circulating such malicious, odious and offensive claims.

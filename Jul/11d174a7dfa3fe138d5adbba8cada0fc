The former National Secretary-General and a present member of board Trustees of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), Hon. Abdullahi Sani Shinkafi has challenged former governor Abdulazeez Yari to hand himself over to Anti-graft agencies and defend himself of alleged diversion of Zamfara State funds. The former governorship candidate under APGA was reacting to claims by a former Attorney General of the state, Hon. Sani Takori who eventually became Yari’s spokesman in a petition filed at the nation’s anti-graft agencies. It could be recalled that a group, Patriots for the Advancement of Peace and Social Development had officially urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to arrest, investigate and prosecute the former Governor, Abdulazeez Yari over alleged corrupt practices and misappropriation of public funds running to over N900 billion belonging to the state during the eight years he was the Zamfara State governor. “The former governor is just moving freely in Abuja as if nothing happened. Let his sins find him out” the former national scribe of APGA lamented Our correspondent gathered that a group in a petition addressed to the EFCC, the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) and the Nigerian Intelligence Financial Unit (NFIU) vowed that it would head to court to obtain an order of mandamus compelling the anti-graft agencies to investigate the former Governor in line with the laws setting them up.

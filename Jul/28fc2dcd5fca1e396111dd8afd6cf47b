The Chief of Army Staff, Lt General T.Y. Buratai, has taken assessment of the Nigerian Army combat readiness as the Army moves to engage and clear banditry and other criminality in the northwest region of the country. Buratai, who was in Zamfara State, where bandits have been terrorising citizens also met with traditional rulers in the area where he solicited for their support as the Nigerian troops swing into action for the effective and efficient clearance operations. He applauded the Emir of Gusau, Alh Dr Ibrahim Bello for the warm reception and continuing support for the Nigerian Army. “We are in Zamfara on operational tour of formations and units of 8 Division Nigerian Army to assess the level of their combat readiness in the reinvigorated efforts to combat banditry and associated insecurity in the zone,” General Buratai said. While at the palace, Gen Buratai informed the emir that the Nigerian Army is celebrating her 157 years of existence (Nigerian Army Day Celebration 2020) and the commencement of Exercise SAHEL SANITY which is currently simultaneously ongoing in Kaduna, Katsina, Niger, Sokoto and Zamfara States with an appreciable level of success. He also solicited for the support of the traditional rulers in sensitizing their people to cooperate with the security agencies by providing the necessary information to help in containing the lingering security challenges in the region and the country at large. While making his remarks, the Emir thanks the COAS for the visit and promised to give all the necessary support to the Nigerian Army and other agencies where necessary in order for peace to reign in the zone.

Sam Amadi, ex-Chairman, Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), has reacted to the Tuesday’s face-off between the executive and legislature of the recruitment of 774,000 Nigerians. After a meeting that ended in a shouting match on Tuesday, Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, accused legislators of trying to control the recruitment. The National Assembly reacted on Wednesday with a resolution that the employment process be halted immediately. In his reaction on Facebook, Amadi wrote: “Who should coordinate FG’s massive emergency employment program? Amorphous committee set up by minister or federal legislators? None. It’s NDE.” The Harvard alumni explained that the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has statutory responsibility to take lead. He insisted that the minister did not need “to constitute a committee of party chieftains”. Amadi said the recruitment was “an executive program as part of formal government and should be handled by an executive agency.” The legal practitioner added that the employment programme “is not also a work for phony legislative oversight”.

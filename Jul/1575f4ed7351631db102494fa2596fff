The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has vowed to resolve the ongoing rift between the Minister of Labour (State), Festus Keyamo and the National Assembly. It would be recalled that the minister had a stormy session with the members of the joint committee on Labour during an interactive session on the 774,000 Special Public Works Programme. Gbajabiamila in his remarks at the public hearing conducted by the House Public account committee chaired by Oluwole Oke on the National School Feeding Program of the federal government urged the committee to avoid the repeat of what happened on Tuesday. “We have to make sure that what happened yesterday in the Senate does not repeat here. It is unfortunate that the National Assembly is not allowed to operate as it should. However, I want to assure you that the matter would be resolved within 24.” Meanwhile, the Senate has announced the suspension of the recruitment exercise and summoned the Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige and the junior minister. The Senate Spokesperson, Sen Ajibola Bashiru made the announcement while briefing newsmen at the National Assembly. “In view of the foregoing, the implementation of the programme shall be on hold pending proper briefing of the National Assembly by the Minister of Labour and Productivity, ” he stated.

The National Youth Coordinator of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Usman Okai Austin, has commended the Chief Justice of Ondo State, Justice Mrs O.O Akeredolu for rejecting a request by the Ondo State House of Assembly to set up a probe panel against the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi. Recall that Justice Olarenwaju Akeredolu had on Friday declined the request by the Ondo State House of Assembly to set up a probe panel against the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi. According to her, the request of the Speaker, Bamidele Oleyelogun, did not meet the constitutional requirements needed to impeach the embattled Deputy Governor. Reacting to the development, Austin slammed the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu Aketi, for attempting to manoeuvre the obtainability of democracy and the Nigerian rule of law for his selfish interest. He said the Justices’ action demonstrated doggedness in the face of impunity threatening to degrade the democracy Nigerians revere. He said, ”I sincerely commend Justice, Mrs O.O Akeredolu who stood against those who aimed to demean, frustrate and misconstrue the democracy and rule of law in our system, you demonstrated this against the impossible odds and Nigerians are proud of you, Okai continued. Okai, however, tasked all Chief Justices in Nigeria to replicate the wonderful example set by Justice, Mrs O.O Akeredolu in their respective States. He maintained that Nigeria needs change agents for a stable and healthy sociopolitical development devoid of intimidation, harassment, subjugation and miscarriage of justices. ”Justice Mrs O.O Akeredolu will no doubt be remembered and honoured by posterity.”

Arsenal Playmaker, Mesut Ozil has decided to stay at Emirates until his current contract with the club expires. Ozil has also told close friends that he wants to play for a club in the USA or Turkey when he leaves the Gunners, Sun Sports reports. His current contract at Arsenal will expire in the summer of 2021. Before the coronavirus enforced break, Ozil featured in all games since Arteta took over from Unai Emery last December. However, Ozil has fallen out of favour under Arteta in recent weeks. The former Germany international was omitted from the Arsenal squad that played 1-1 with Leicester City on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Arteta has since told Ozil that he will be restored to the team when he “can give his best”. “Again, I am the first one who wants Mesut at his best. I will put him on the pitch when I think he can give his best,” Arteta said.

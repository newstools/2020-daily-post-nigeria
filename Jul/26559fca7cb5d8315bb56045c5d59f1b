The Sokoto State Police Command has arrested one Shuaibu Aliyu, for allegedly impregnating a 14-year-old girl and dumping the baby in a bush. The suspect was arrested after one Alhaji Abubakar reported the case at Wamakko police station in the state. It was learned that the teenage girl got pregnant sometime in 2019 after Shuaibu lured her into his room and forcefully had sex with her. She then took the child to the suspect and he connived with his friend still at large and threw the baby into a bush at Gidan Abuja village. Sokoto State Commissioner of Police, CP Sani Kaoje disclosed this while briefing journalists on Thursday, adding that the suspect was arrested for rape and an attempt to commit a culpable homicide. Kaoje said “One Alhaji Hamisu Abubakar of Kalambaina area, Wamakko LGA, Sokoto State, reported at Wamakko Police Station, that sometime in November 2019, Shuaibu Aliyu lured a 14-year-old into his room and forcefully had sexual intercourse with her. “As a result she became pregnant. She then took the child to the suspect who went together with his friend, one Nasiru Attahiru now at large, and threw the baby in the bush at Gidan Boka village, Wamakko LGA of Sokoto State.” The CP added that the baby was found by a good samaritan who nurtured her through the Director of Social Welfare, Wamakko LGA, and alerted the police. He added that efforts are still ongoing to arrest the other fleeing suspect as the case is still under investigation and would be lodged in the court soon.

Real Madrid could wrap up the LaLiga title race on Thursday, with a win against Villareal at the Alfredo Di Stefano stadium. Zinedine Zidaneâ€™s men only need two points from their two remaining league fixtures to be crowned champions. It will be their first domestic title since 2017. Barcelona have won six league titles out of nine completed seasons since 2010, with Real Madrid winning only two. But tonight, Real go into the game four points clear over current champions and rivals Barca, who host Osasuna at the same time. However, things could get tricky against Villarreal, who have been one of the best performing teams in LaLiga this season. The Castellon club has no chance of finishing in the top four, but will be keen on finishing the campaign above Getafe (6th) and Real Sociedad (7th).

Nollywood Actress, Lala Akindoju has criticized the Actors Guild of Nigeria after members visited Regina Daniels. The Actors Guild of Nigeria visited the new mum, Regina Daniels and her billionaire husband, Ned Nwoko. The group led by the AGN President, Emeka Rollas presented a gift to the new mum and declared Regina’s baby ‘Nollywood baby of the year.” However, Lala opposed the visit, criticizing the guild for its priorities at a time like this. She described the visit as shameful, urging the guild to show leadership on pressing issues like “navigating the industry with COVID-19 pandemic and creating structures to stop sexual harassment.” Her post via her Instagram page read: “This visit is actually shameful. In these COVID-19 times when the actor’s guild should show leadership on pressing issues like navigating the industry with COVID-19 and creating structures to stop sexual harassment in the industry. “This is their priority. Even if you visit your member, must you film and post? The videos we need to see is about future and safety of practitioners. Yet, they abuse us and insist that we join.”

A former Arsenal and Chelsea midfielder, Cesc Fabregas, has named the toughest player he played against in his career so far. Fabregas, who now plays for AS Monaco in French Ligue 1, said Liverpool legend, Steven Gerrard, is the toughest opponent he faced in his career. The 33-year-old disclosed that Gerrard, who is currently the coach of the Scottish Premiership club, Rangers, provided him with the most difficult challenges, adding that he was a ‘machine.’ Asked by BBC’s Match of the Day who his most difficult opponent was, Fabregas, replied: “If I have to say one – and I really enjoyed playing against – I would say, Steven Gerrard. “He was physically the most difficult opponent to handle. “He was the box-to-box player, he could be on his right or left, shooting from the outside of his boot. He was a machine.”

Gruesome images gathered by DAILY POST had provided fresh evidence of crimes perpetrated by military officers while going after bandits in Southern Taraba State. The images obtained by DAILY POST from numerous sources during the attack in Taraba State revealed graphic evidence of killings and destruction of property. Recall that Tiv leaders in Taraba State had on July 3rd accused the military of raping their wives, daughters and destroying their property during a raid in the community. They were also alleged to have allegedly killed a family of four during the raid at Tse Juku and Akinde villages in Donga Local Government Area of the state on the 29th of June 2020. Chief Goodman Dahida, President General of the association, had said, “The soldiers who drove in a vehicle marked NA 93AN13, killed Vihishima Aondowase, his wife, 9-year-old child and a cousin who were returning from the hospital.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813396" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/taraba3.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="960" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/taraba3.jpg 576w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/taraba3-180x300.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px"> “They also shot and wounded several others. Instead of apologizing for their action of killing a helpless poor family, the military high command in Abuja addressed a press conference and hailed their men of killing bandits in Taraba State.” But, the Defense Headquarters in a statement released on Saturday said the raid was based on actionable human and technical intelligence on bandits activities in the area. A statement signed by Director, Defence Media Operations, Maj. Gen. John Enenche, confirmed that four bandits were killed during the raid, while an unconfirmed number escaped with gunshot wounds. Enenche also described as mischievous, claims that soldiers were “raping their wives and daughters, and destroying their properties. He said, “What Mr. Dahida should understand is that troops do not just embark on operations for the mere fun of it, especially when lives are at stake.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813398" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/taraba.jpg" alt="" width="576" height="960" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/taraba.jpg 576w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/taraba-180x300.jpg 180w" sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px"> “During the actual operation, the troops came in contact with suspected Tiv militias at Tse Juku village. The armed militias opened fire on sighting the troops who responded with superior firepower thereby neutralizing 4 of them in the process while an unconfirmed number escaped with gunshot wounds. “As such, rather than commending the troops for their diligence, sacrifices, and commitment to fostering peace in Taraba State, it is most unfortunate to hear the TCSA disregard these sacrifices and efforts for cheap publicity. However, Dahida, who had commended the efforts of the state government in intervening in the Tiv/Jukun crisis, alleged that there was a deliberate plan to evict the Tiv people from Taraba state. He, therefore, urged the federal government to quickly intervene in the matter before it generates into another insecurity. Image Image

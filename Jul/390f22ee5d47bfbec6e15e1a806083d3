The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has declared that Edo State is not Adams Oshiomhole’s personal property. PDP’s National Vice Chairman (South-South), Dan Orbih made the declaration while warning the former National Chairman the All Progressives Congress, APC, against his vow of reclaiming the state. The Chairman of the state PDP campaign council spoke in Benin City, the Edo State capital, yesterday. Orbih stated that people of the state won’t allow Oshiomhole and his party to deceive them again. Orbih, however, boasted that the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki would emerge winner of the upcoming election. According to Orbih: “Those at the forefront in the campaign to take the state back must be stopped. This state is not the property of Adams Oshiomhole. “In 2016, Ize-Iyamu apologized for making Adams Oshiomhole governor. In 2020 it’s the turn of Adams Oshiomhole. Edo people are too politically sophisticated to be fooled. “It is not a simple agenda! Edo people rejected the simple agenda in 2016 and will do so again in 2020. Let the people decide. Not in Adams but in God we trust, and with the support of the people Governor Godwin Obaseki will win again,” he said. People of Edo State will on September 19, file out to perform their civic responsibility of deciding who governs them for the next four years. The incumbent governor, Godwin Obaseki of the PDP and Ize-Iyamu are the leading contenders, ahead of the governorship election.

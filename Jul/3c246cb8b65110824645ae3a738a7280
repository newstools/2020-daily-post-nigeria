Manchester City are close to signing Ferran Torres from Valencia, ESPN reports. City will pay €23million plus add-ons for the Spain U-21 winger. Pep Guardiola made the 20-year-old Torres his prime target this summer, following the departure of Leroy Sane to Bayern Munich. Valencia have been resigned to losing the player, who had just one year left on his contract. He made 97 appearances for the LaLiga side, scoring nine times. Personal terms should not be a problem with Torres, who is keen to link up with Guardiola at the Etihad Stadium. After finalising the deal with Valencia, City are expected to turn their attention to bolstering Guardiola’s defence.

The immediate past Governor of Zamfara State, Alhaji Abdulazeez Yari, has declared that the presidency will shift to the South come 2023. He said that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) would ensure power shifts to the South after the tenure of President Muhammadu Buhari. Addressing reporters yesterday, the former Governor said “As we have seen the nature of how our presidency will look like, it has to go to the South. The chairmanship may likely as well come to the North in preparation for that.” Yari insisted that he was one of the Northern leaders canvassing for power shift in 2023, adding, “Of course, that is how things are supposed to be.” He, however, refused to be specific about the geo-political zone in the South that should have the ticket, saying, “I don’t want to make an offensive statement. APC leaders will decide. “As a leader, I do not want to talk and be offending some of our members and leaders.” Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, had on Saturday denied he was planning to run for President in 2023. Lawan was reacting to speculations that he could run for the highest office in the land, after President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term elapses.

Former Real Madrid coach, Fabio Capello has revealed why forward, Eden Hazard, struggled under manager, Zinedine Zidane at the Santiago Bernabeu this season. Hazard established himself as one of the best players in the world during his time at Chelsea. The Belgium international, who scored over 100 goals for Chelsea, joined Real Madrid last summer for more than £100million. His performances for Zidane’s side were largely underwhelming as he scored just once during the 2019/20 season. But Capello believes Hazard has not adapted fully at the Los Blancos after his move from Stamford Bridge, adding that he would perform better next season. “He has not been the player he was at Chelsea, and he was injured for a long time, he has not adapted,” Capello told Marca. ‘I have always thought of him as a great player, but the Real shirt weighs heavily, and Hazard has sunk this year. It’s clear that he’ll be better next season.” Meanwhile, Hazard had last week insisted that the 2019/20 season was the worst campaign of his career so far despite winning the La Liga title.

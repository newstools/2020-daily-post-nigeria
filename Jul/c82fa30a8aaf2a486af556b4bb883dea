Former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to sack Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta Affairs. He also appealed to him to take necessary steps to end the corruption in NDDC by removing Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, the acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. Fayose gave the advice in a tweet via his official Twitter handle on Friday. He wrote: “With this level of fraud exposed in NDDC, Buhari must sack Akpabio now. The President can’t continue to treat looting of public treasury as a family affair and his fight against corruption as an instrument of persecution against opposition figures. “By keeping in his govt the likes of Akpabio and the NDDC MD, Prof Pondei, who went about celebrating the success of their National Assembly drama with hot pepper soup and assorted drinks, the President will only be reinforcing the conclusion that he supports corruption.” DAILY POST had reported that the National Assembly is currently investigating the Interim Management Committee, IMC, of NDDC over alleged fraud and mismanagement of funds. During an investigative hearing by the House of Representatives last Monday, Akpabio had accused members of the National Assembly of being beneficiaries of most of the contracts from NDDC. Recall that Joy Nunieh, former Managing Director of NDDC had accused Akpabio of padding, fraud and sexual harassment. The Minister, however, denied all allegations Nunieh made against him and ordered his lawyers to initiate legal proceedings against her. <img class="size-full wp-image-820824 aligncenter" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fayose.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="287" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fayose.jpg 594w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fayose-300x145.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px">

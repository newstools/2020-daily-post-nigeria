The Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has disclosed its major achievement between January 2019 to April 2020. NCC disclosed that ninety eight percent of the total service-related complaints received from telecoms consumers within a 16-month period under review was successfully resolved. A statement by NCC’s Director of Public Affairs, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde said the commission was committed towards ensuring the improvement in the Quality of Service, QoS, and Quality of Experience, QoE, for the nation’s over 190 million telecom subscribers amid the Coronavirus pandemic. Adinde said the complaints were received through all NCC’s official channels of communication. According to Adinde: “In the period under review, 26,169 complaints were received and managed by the Commission to the satisfaction of the overwhelming majority of telecom consumers. Of that number, 25,575, representing 98 percent of the total complaints received were expeditiously resolved. “Many of the satisfied consumers reverted to either acknowledge the prompt resolution of their complaints or to thank the Commission for its intervention in service-related issues between them and their respective service providers. “The complaints were received through all the Commission’s official channels of communication. These include 24,481 complaints received through Commission’s Contact Centres; 1,007 complaints received through the NCC Consumer Portal; and 296 others received as written complaints submitted at NCC Head Office in Abuja and at the Commission’s five zonal offices in Lagos, Enugu, Port Harcourt, Kano and Ibadan.”

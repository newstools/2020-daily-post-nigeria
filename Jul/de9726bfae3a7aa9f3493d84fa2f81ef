Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has named Bayern Munich and Manchester City as the two favourite clubs that can win this season’s UEFA Champions League trophy. Klopp, whose side were knocked out from the competition by Atletico Madrid, believes Bayern Munich and Man City can succeed Liverpool as champions of Europe. Man City defeated Real Madrid 2-1 in the Champions League round of 16 first leg fixture at the Santiago Bernabeu, while Bayern Munich won Chelsea 3-0 at Stamford Bridge. “I think for me the two big favourites clubs left in the competition are Bayern and Man City,” Klopp was quoted by Metro UK as saying ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League clash with Brighton on Wednesday. “Bayern played an impressive season in Germany after Hansi Flick took over [as coach from Niko Kovac]. It was really impressive what they did, and these two clubs are the favourite. “I do not know exactly how it could happen, if both teams meet in the semi-final or final or whatever, but the competition [in August] will be really interesting. “It will be really new. But when you see Manchester City, the squad is massive. They have a massive chance. “Everybody needs luck, and if you want to win the Champions League trophy you should have your best line up ready for the final if possible, but I really think these two teams are the two favourites. “I’ll watch the tournament. It will be interesting, but unfortunately, we have nothing, really, to do with it this year.”

A police inspector, a councillor, two wives of a famous hunter and two other people have been kidnapped in a night raid in Adamawa State. DAILY POST learnt that the six were picked up in an operation carried out by gunmen in the famous rural Koma community, Jada Local Government Area. It was gathered Friday that the operation which took place in the early hours of Thursday, led to the death of one person. Witnesses said the gunmen abducted the police officer identified simply as Inspector Yakubu, the councillor representing Koma ward Bulus Geoffrey, a business man and a woman, and two wives of a hunter famously called Hassan. The deceased identified as one Wawu, was said to have been gunned down by the suspected kidnappers as they headed with their victims into surrounding bushes. The night marauders were said to have arrived Koma in large numbers and took their time picking their targets one after the other from their respective houses, scarring off possible opposition with their guns. “They visited the house of Malam Hassan who is one of the popular hunters in the area probably to kill him but they didn’t meet him in his house. So they abducted his two wives,” a source said. Only on Monday, the Adamawa State Police Command paraded 33 suspected kidnappers and 31 other suspects, with assurance that the command was on top of criminal elements around the state. Confirming the latest incident of abduction in Koma, the state Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, said the police had gone after the suspects.

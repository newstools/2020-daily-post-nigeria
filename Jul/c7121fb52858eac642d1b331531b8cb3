Primate Elijah Ayodele of the INRI Evangelical spiritual church has bemoaned President Muhammadu Buhari’s fight against corruption. Ayodele said God revealed to him that corruption will discredit Buhari government if he fails to take the fight seriously. Primate Ayodele said Buhari must sack Ministers and people in his government who have been accused of corruption. In a series of prophecies he forwarded to DAILY POST on Sunday, the prophet said, “Corruption will cheat Buhari’s government. If he doesn’t sack corrupt ministers, it will fight his government back. “There is corruption in the military, if he doesn’t act on it, it will discredit his government. “He should take corruption seriously. There is also corruption in the Judiciary, CBN, NNPC. If he wants people to compliment his government, these are the areas his government should work on.” He added, “On kidnapping, Buhari’s government has not gotten it right. These are the things that will discredit him. Buhari and his Chief of Staff are not up to the task yet .” Recall that Ayodele had yesterday predicted an assassination attempt on the Chief of Army Staff, Maj. Gen. Tukur Buratai.

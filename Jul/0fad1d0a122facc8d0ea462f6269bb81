Speaking in the same vein, the chairman of Igbo-Eze South Traditional Rulers Council, Igwe Okechukwu Okeh echoed the sentiments of gratitude for the hospital project which he says has come at the right time. According to him, “the construction of seven hospitals in seven local government areas is an initiative that has come at an opportune time. We all know the health challenges that the whole world is battling with now. So, building these hospitals now will help the rural dwellers to maintain healthy living and have access to quality healthcare. “In addition, our humane governor is rebuilding other run-down general hospitals throughout the state to make them fully functional. Enugu State has not had it this good and we thank Gov. Ugwuanyi for these interventions. Posterity will reward him.” Chief Thomas Onyeke, a prominent community leader also paid tributes to the governor for the choice of rural local government areas to site the health facilities. “You see, no legacy is bigger or better than building hospitals to save the lives of people who live in the urban and rural communities. That is what Gov. Ugwuanyi is doing exactly and we thank him for always remembering those of us who live in the villages,” he noted. Other stakeholders spoke in the same vein, noting that the completion of the Type 3 hospitals and the total rehabilitation of the other health facilities will take healthcare to the doorsteps of the people of Enugu State.

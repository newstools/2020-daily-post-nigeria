Chelsea will make a formal bid for Bayer Leverkusen’s Kai Havertz when their Champions League qualification is confirmed, ESPN reports. The Blues are confident of securing a deal in the region of £70-£75 million, despite Leverkusen demanding closer to £90m. However, negotiations are yet to begin, but Havertz is believed to be keen on joining the Premier League side this summer and the club expects an agreement to be reached. The 21-year-old has verbally agreed to a four/five-year contract with Chelsea. Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, on Tuesday refused to be drawn on Havertz during his press conference ahead of their Premier League trip to Liverpool, where they can secure Champions League qualification with a win. “I’m not talking about Kai Havertz. I’ve said before, he is a player of another team,” Lampard said.

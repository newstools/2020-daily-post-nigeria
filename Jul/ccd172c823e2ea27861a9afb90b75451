The Embassy of China in Abuja has said the attempt by some Nigerians to institute legal actions against China over the COVID-19 pandemic was shoddy, with zero bases in facts, law or International precedence. The Embassy disclosed this known in a statement via its verified twitter handle on Wednesday, stating that the attention of the Embassy was drawn to the supposed legal action via some recent local media reporting. It stated that China, like every other country, is a victim of the pandemic and acted responsibly from the outset to protect people’s life and health and safeguard public health. “Our attention has been drawn to some recent local media reporting that “Nigerians drag China to court and seek compensation over COVID-19 Pandemic.” “The attempt to file frivolous lawsuits is a shoddy one, as it has zero bases, in fact, law or international precedence. “The Embassy made its position on this issue very clear in a statement issued on April 30 and here wishes to reiterate it: COVID-19 has caught the whole world by surprise. “China, like other countries, is a victim. Confronted by an unknown virus, we have acted responsibly to protect people’s life and health and safeguard global public health. “China was the first country to report cases to WHO and promptly shared information with relevant countries and regions, the first to sequence the genome of the virus. “And share it with the world, and the first to publish guidelines for treatment and containment. “Once we sensed the severity of the situation, we made a tough decision that cut off the route of transmission in the shortest possible time and stopped the fast-spreading virus in its tracks. “All this was achieved at an enormous cost and with huge sacrifice,” it stated. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-814561" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/china.jpg" alt="" width="636" height="900" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/china.jpg 636w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/china-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 636px) 100vw, 636px">

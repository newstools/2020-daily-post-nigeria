He said all guidelines stipulated by the government for the students’ resumption were to be followed strictly by all school administrators. He enjoined all stakeholders to cooperate with the state government to ensure a safe return to schools. “The Ogun state government wishes to inform the general public that all Senior Secondary School Three students both in public and private schools will resume school on August 4 in readiness for intensive revision classes ahead of their WASSCE. “The revision exercise is being put in place to cover the academic gaps and lapses for students that could not follow the virtual classes tagged Ogundigiclass put in place by the state government while they were at home. “The concerned students are to resume their individual schools on Tuesday, August 4,” he said.

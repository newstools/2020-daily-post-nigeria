Manchester United midfielder, Fred, has warned his team-mates about one Leicester City player ahead of Sunday’s Premier League fixture. Man United and Leicester City will clash at the King Power Stadium on the final day of the Premier League season, with the winner set to qualify for next season’s Champions League. The Red Devils go into the fixture following a 1-1 draw with West Ham United in their previous game. But Fred is wary of the threat of Leicester City striker, Jamie Vardy, who is currently the highest goal scorer in the league. “Vardy is not the top scorer just by chance,” Fred told MUTV. “So we need to nullify his threat. He’s a top player, and he’s having a great season. “We need to take a lot of care with him. He’s a very good player, we need to think about his goal threat, but we have very good players in defence who are capable of nullifying him.” Fred added: “Leicester are a big team and they did really well. “For a period, they were competing at the top of the table for first place, but then they subsequently fell off. They are a very, very good team and we respect them.” EPL final day: Highest goal scorers in Premier League revealed FA Cup semi-final: Lampard warns Chelsea about four Man Utd players EPL top four: Dimitar Berbatov predicts scorelines of Chelsea vs Wolves, Leicester vs Man Utd

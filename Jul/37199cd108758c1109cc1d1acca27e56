The Federal Government has warned Nigerians of another pandemic outbreak, if the country fails to take advantage of opportunities presented by COVID-19, to improve its health infrastructure. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, stated this while inaugurating the Board of Experts (BoE) of the Healthcare Sector Research and Development Intervention Scheme (HSRDIS) in Abuja on Monday. According to Mustapha, Nigeria will have to start all over again if confronted with another pandemic, if they fail to take crucial actions now. “If we had built on the experiences of Ebola and other epidemics in the past, probably today we would not have started with two molecular laboratories for the testing of COVID-19. “If you travel the shores of this country, you will find out that we have over 10,000 public primary healthcare centres scattered inwards and villages across the country, ill-equipped, ineffective and not being put into use but we keep building them,” he said.

Redeemed Christian Church of God Pastor, RCCG,Gideon Bakare, in Akure has been suspended after being caught while trying to sleep with a member’s wife. Bakare was caught in a viral video sitting half naked in a compromising position with a woman who was described as a wife of a member of the church’s branch in Akure, Ondo State capital. The video generated a lot of reactions from Nigerians on social media which led to his suspension by the church administrators. Reacting, the RCCG spokesperson Olaitan Olubiyi in a statement released on Wednesday said Bakare has been suspended for attempting adultery. According to the statement, Bakare was also accused of putting the church in a bad light. The statement reads, ”The Redeemed Christian Church of God has excommunicated Mr Gideon Bakare and relieved him of all ministerial duties in the mission. “Bakare, who was an Assistant Pastor in the Church was recently accused of attempted act of adultery with a woman in her matrimonial home in Akure, Ondo State. “The Church dissociates itself from such immoral act of Mr Bakare and has described it as being completely contrary to the values, doctrines, beliefs and practices of the RCCG and the word of God. “The Church, after reviewing the report of her investigation, noted that by his conduct, Bakare has not only tainted his personal reputation but has portrayed the Church in a bad light. ”Mr Bakare has, therefore, been directed to return all official items in his custody and stay off all associated connections with the mission with immediate effect.”

A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, says the sudden death of Tolulope Arotile has caused a national mourning. He expressed sadness over the passing of the Nigeria’s first female combat pilot. In a statement on Sunday, Adegboruwa called it tragic, painful and gruesome. “The inconsistent stories emerging from the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) has not helped to douse the suspicions”, the SAN said. He noted that the least Nigerians expect is a proper investigation, followed with a Coroner’s Inquest, including an independent autopsy report. Adegboruwa stated that there is no point in rushing to bury her in the light emerging revelations. The legal practitioner further asked the NAF 10 questions about the incident. “Who drove the car? Where did the accident happen? Where was Arotile going to? A reversing car means it had passed her, so was she trekking? Was she blindfolded not to see the reversing car to escape? Were her legs tied? He also quipped: “What kind of medical treatment did she receive? In which hospital was she treated? Who called her out from her rest after a successful air combat on bandits? Why are there inconsistent statements from the NAF being released in bits and pieces?” The senior lawyer urged President Muhammadu Buhari to direct a full investigation into the death and suspend the burial plans until the conclusion of the investigations. Other Nigerians and groups are insisting on a thorough probe. On Saturday, former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, said he suspected that Arotile was murdered.

Bayern Munich manager, Hansi Flick, has tipped Robert Lewandowski to win the Ballon d’Or this year after he netted his 51st goal in their DFB-Pokal final win on Saturday night. Lewandowski scored a brace as Bayern beat Bayer Leverkusen 4-2 on Saturday to retain their DFB-Pokal crown. The Bundesliga champions have also won a domestic double for the second successive season. Lewandowski topped the scoring charts in the league with 34 goals, to lead Bayern to an eighth consecutive title. The Poland striker has netted 11 times in the Champions League, which resumes in August. “If I measure for goals now and I see that he has scored 34 goals in the Bundesliga this year, then you can think about how a player from the Bundesliga can become the Ballon d’Or winner. “So why not? He has laid all the groundwork with this achievement this year and I would wish him well,” Flick told reporters after the game. Barcelona superstar, Lionel Messi, took home the Ballon d’Or in 2019, edging Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk and Cristiano Ronaldo. Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is the last Bayern player to win the individual prize in 1981.

The Kano Road Traffic Agency, KAROTA says the threats of attack it raised may have materialised as the body recently apprehended 10 fake military officers. The Kano road Agency raised concerns sometime last month that it uncovered plans by unknown gunmen to attack its men on duty, a situation that forced the evacuation of men from their various duty posts. The Agency’s Managing Director, Baffa Babba DanAgundi, said in Kano, that not less than 100 of its men are recovering from various injuries sustained from a series of attacks by gunmen. Baffa noted that out of the over 100 staff who sustained injuries, 40 are quite critical. He said the fake soldiers who were arrested in collaboration with the Police have been taken to the State CID for further questioning. He explained that soon the arrest and evacuation of illegal streets hawkers will commence. He said the areas identified for evacuation included Sabon Gari by Igbo Road and France Road, adding that the aim was to allow for a free flow of traffic. “We have given enough ultimatum to the roadside traders to vacate for almost 6 months now but they are still operating, that is why we are going to enforce our works”.

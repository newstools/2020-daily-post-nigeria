Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, former Nigerian Minister of Finance, has reacted to her recommendation for the post of Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) by Atiku Abubakar, ex-Vice-President. Okonjo-Iweala thanked Atiku, a former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for his recommendation. The former minister is currently jostling for the position of a Director-General of the WTO and her pursuit was acknowledged by President Muhammadu Buhari. In July, WTO had also acknowledged Okonjo-Iweala as Nigeria’s nominee for the post. However, Atiku on Saturday said Okonjo-Iweala possessed the requisite skills to fill such capacity. Reacting, the former minister in a tweet wrote: “Thank you, Your Excellency.” The current WTO Director-General, Roberto Azevêdo, has announced he will step down on August 31, 2020.

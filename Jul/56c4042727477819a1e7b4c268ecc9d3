The 2019/2020 Premier League season comes to a delayed end on Sunday, July 26. Among other things, it will see the conclusion of the race for the top scorer’s prize. Jamie Vardy of Leicester City currently leads the charts with 23 goals and is closing in on his first Golden Boot crown. Realistically, there are four players within Vardy’s reach. Danny Ings is two behind on 21, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has 20, while Mo Salah and Raheem Sterling have 19 each. On the final day, Vardy faces Manchester United at the King Power Stadium, Ings’ Southampton host Sheffield United, Aubameyang’s Arsenal are at home to Watford, Mo Salah’s Liverpool travel Newcastle, and Sterling’s Manchester City welcome Norwich. In the event of a tie, the Golden Boot will be shared, just as it was last year after Salah, Aubameyang and Sadio Mane all finished on 22 goals.

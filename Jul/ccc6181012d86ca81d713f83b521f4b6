President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration has ordered the arrest of those who attacked the Federal Medical Center (FMC) in Lokoja, Kogi State. It described the assault on the federal institution as unacceptable and an embarrassment Secretary to the Government (SGF), Boss Mustapha, reacted angrily at a media briefing on Thursday. Thugs stormed the hospital just before a press conference called to demand a COVID-19 screening centre in Kogi. The speakers were also to comment on the challenges that health workers face amid the pandemic. Mustapha announced that security agencies had commenced investigations. He said the PTF “received with great concern” reports that the FMC was attacked “by some hoodlums”. The senior official expressed regret about “the trauma to which medical workers, patients and others who went on their legitimate businesses were subjected to”. Mustapha said relevant agencies “have been tasked with the responsibility for fishing out the criminal elements behind the attack and they will be brought to justice. We thank law-abiding Nigerians for reporting the occurrence promptly”.

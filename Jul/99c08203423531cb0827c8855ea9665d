Bayer Leverkusen midfielder, Kai Havertz will reportedly become Chelsea’s fifth-highest earner next season, if he eventually joins the Blues. DAILY POST recalls that Chelsea has already agreed on personal terms with Havertz to move to Stamford Bridge this summer. But Frank Lampard’s side are yet to reach an agreement with Bayer Leverkusen for the 21-year-old forward. According to Spotrac’s wages for Chelsea, Havertz will earn a basic wage of £140,000-a-week, plus bonuses, which would make him the club’s fifth highest earner. Christian Pulisic is currently top of the list on £158k, followed by Kepa Arrizabalaga on £150k and N’Golo Kante on £144k. Willian is currently in fourth with his £138k, but his deal is set to expire at the end of the season. Meanwhile, Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has admitted his admiration for Havertz but insists the club has not made an offer for the Germany youngster. Lampard said: “No, no bids have gone in. He is obviously a top player, but we are certainly not going to comment on other players at other teams, and it cannot be our focus. Nothing to say.” Chelsea has already signed Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech from RB Leipzig and Ajax respectively.

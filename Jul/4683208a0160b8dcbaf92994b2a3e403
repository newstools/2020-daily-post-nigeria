Anthony Joshua has said Mike Tyson would take him the distance if they fight now. Tyson, 54, is set for a return to the ring after 15 years and will face former four-weight champion, Roy Jones Jr in an eight-round exhibition. WBC champion, Tyson Fury, claims he was offered £10 million to fight his namesake, but turned down the offer. However, Fury’s rival, Joshua, 30, was asked how he would fare if he took on the former heavyweight champion. He told Sky Sports: “I don’t want to say anything because I love Mike Tyson, he would land a few left hooks and body shots but we would go the distance. “His age would show but we would be pushing and shoving. He is in my top three.”

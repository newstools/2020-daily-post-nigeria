President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with the families of victims of recent boat mishaps on inland waterways in Benue and Lagos States. Describing their deaths as “sad and unfortunate,” the President also condoled with the governments and people of both States. A statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said that President Buhari, while calling on state authorities and surrounding communities to step up rescue efforts of passengers still missing, urged would-be passengers of water transportation to adhere strictly to safety regulations outlined by national and state authorities in order to prevent avoidable accidents and loss of lives and property. According to the President, “Such a call has become imperative in view of prevailing COVID-19 guidelines against overcrowding and night travels.” He prayed that God will comfort the bereaved families and grant rest to the souls of the departed. Recall LASEMA boss disclosed that 14 persons were rescued after the boat incident happened around 8 p.m. on July 3, having departed Ebute-Ero enroute Ikorodu in violation of night-time restrictions.

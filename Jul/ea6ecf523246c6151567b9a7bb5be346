The Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has claimed politicians are playing games with Nigerians amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Bello stated this while speaking on Thursday while hosting the members of the Board of Trustees (BoT) of the Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation, who paid him a courtesy call at the Government House in Lokoja. The Governor also called for employment opportunities to be created, instead of resorting to lockdown and keeping citizens at home. “Let us stop this game. Nigerians are suffering. Instead of the lockdown with its attendant negative effects on the people, why can’t we turn it into employment opportunities; providing clothes for face masks to be exported to those countries who have the disease? “COVID-19 is not a new disease in our clime. We have our own way of treating it and that is what we should be exploiting, rather than subjecting our people to hardship, hunger and starvation through lockdown,” Bello said. As at Thursday, Nigeria had 26,484 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Of that number, only four patients are in Kogi State.

Ebonyi State government yesterday announced its readiness to commence fumigation and clearing of schools ahead of the scheduled schools’ resumption in August 2020. Recall that, the Governor, David Umahi had said schools will reopen in the forthcoming month; August 2020. The Commissioner for Education, Dr Onyebuchi Chima made this known while interacting with Journalists in Abakaliki. He said the entire school environment must be cleared and fumigated to ensure effective teaching and learning processes. Chima noted that the state government is not happy losing academic periods due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but vowed not to risk the health of the pupils and students. According to him: “The state government shall intensify and expand radio and television teaching and learning through opening Educational technology assessment centres to carry out virtual learning in the hinterland. This will help to keep not just the exam classes but all the children in schools busy till when it is safe to reopen schools. The commissioner further disclosed that the state shall commence master trainers’ workshop for them to keep their intellectual power alive, just as he assured to carry along the staff and management of private schools to reduce the effects of COVID-19. Chima, however, urged all parents/ guardians to make provision for virtual learning for their children/ wards in line with 21st-century innovations but advised them to be mindful of who comes in contact with their children to avoid rape and all forms of assault. He decried the vandalisation of government school properties by hoodlums and threatened to hold traditional rulers, town union executives, teachers, principals and all stakeholders of the host communities responsible. Responding, the Chairman of Ebonyi State Universal Basic Education Board, Hycenth Ikpor pledged to support the radio or television teaching and enjoined all stakeholders in the educational sector to leave no stone unturned.

Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, singled out Crystal Palace forward, Wilfried Zaha, for praise ahead of the Red Devils’ Premier League clash with Roy Hodgson’s men at Selhurst Park on Thursday night. Solskjaer, who coached Zaha during their time together at Cardiff City, described the Ivory Coast international as a ‘very humble boy’, adding that he is a difficult player to play against. Solskjaer’s side head to the game after playing a 2-2 with Southampton in their previous fixture at Old Trafford on Monday. “I really enjoyed working with Wilfried at Cardiff,” Solskjaer was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying. “He’s a very humble boy, he wanted to train, he loves football, and of course we know all about his skills when he’s on his game. “He’s difficult to play against. He knows about Aaron and Luke and whoever he comes up against it will be a fascinating battle.” The kick-off time between Crystal Palace vs Man United is 8:15 pm.

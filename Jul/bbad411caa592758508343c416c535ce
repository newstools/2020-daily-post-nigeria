Some members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Imo State have accused the immediate past Governor of the state, Emeka Ihedioha of secretly planning to impose Charles Ugwu, a former Minister of Commerce and Industry as the new chairman of the party in the Saturday State congress. The allegation was fueled yesterday when the former deputy speaker of House of Representatives returned from Abuja after the Supreme Court Judgement that removed him as the Governor of the state preparatory to the state congress. DAILY POST learnt that Emeka Ihedioha who addressed members of the party at his Civic Centre residence Owerri, adopted the octogenarian as the consensus candidate for the chairmanship position in the Saturday state congress. It was further gathered that Martins Ejiogu who is the state acting chairman of the party will be demoted to his former position as the deputy chairman while Ray Emeana and Law Biaduo will retain their seats as the Secretary and Organizing Secretary of the party respectively. Meanwhile, some members of the party and supporters of Emeka Nwokeke, another contestant of the chairmanship position, have expressed their displeasure over the alleged imposition, describing it as unhealthy to the growth of the party. In a phone chat with a member of PDP who pleaded anonymity, he said the party is known for her penchant in recycling old politicians rather than grooming young ones whose blood is still virile. “Charles Ugwu is an old man. He may not be strong enough to withstand the storm. We have young people who are qualified to take up the position, but they won’t allow them. This is a practice in this party I hate so much and I bet, this party will collapse under Charles Ugwu,” he said.

The organisers of the Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, have announced major changes in the 2020 program of the reality show. This year’s BBNaija ‘Lockdown’ would have no unexpected celebrity visits. This is due to the coronavirus pandemic. Also there would not be a live audience at the Sunday night eviction show like in previous editions. For the first time, Biggie’s house has an in-house hair saloon and other exclusive features. Also, the Head of House would be able to select a deputy Head of House, HoH, which will also have privileges. Twenty housemates would jostle for the grand prize of N85m for the next 10 weeks.

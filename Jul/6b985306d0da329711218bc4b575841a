Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has revealed that he spoke with Cristiano Ronaldo, before deciding to sign Bruno Fernandes. Fernandes has become an instant hit at United since joining in a £67.7million deal from Sporting in the January transfer window. The Red Devils had extensively scouted the Portugal midfielder, but Solskjaer wanted to find out more about the 25-year-old before approving the deal. Fernandes and Ronaldo know each other well from playing together with the national team. “We’ve got the chief scouts who do all the scouting, we’ve got the analysts who analyse and break everything down to the minutest detail. But you can see that with your eye really what talent and quality you’ve got,” Solskjaer told the High-Performance Podcast. “Then you speak to teammates, who maybe play with them in the national team. “So obviously Cristiano was an easy goal for me. “I managed to get through Patrice Evra, I managed to get hold of Cristiano and his recommendation obviously stands him [Fernandes] in good stead.”

Chelsea winger, Willian, has not made a u-turn about his future at the club, according to his agent, Kia Joorabchian. The Brazil international is expected to decide on his future after this Saturday’s FA Cup against Arsenal. Joorabchian, speaking with talkSPORT, also revealed that Willian has received five offers – from MLS, Premier League and European clubs. Willian’s current deal was extended, to allow him play until the end of the season which was delayed by COVID-19. The 31-year-old has been linked with Chelsea rivals, Arsenal and Tottenham, but now his agent has claimed he has several offers on the table. “He’s had a big offer from the MLS and two teams from the Premier League and two offers in Europe,” Joorabchian said. “He will make his mind up after the FA Cup.”

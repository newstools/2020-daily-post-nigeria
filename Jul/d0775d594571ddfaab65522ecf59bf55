The Nasarawa State Government on Saturday demolished 25 buildings situated along waterways. Mr Abubakar Mohammed, Chief Environmental Officer at the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources disclosed this on Saturday in Lafia after the monthly sanitation exercise in the state. According to the Environmental Officer, the demolition was aimed at mitigating flood as predicted by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet). “NiMet predicted that flooding would occur in 32 states including Nasarawa State, hence the need for precautionary measures to protect lives and property. “The demolitions, which were carried out in Lafia, Akwanga and Karu Local Government Areas, were still ongoing to clear all waterways to ensure a free flow of water and avoid flooding. “So far, six structures were demolished in Lafia, two in Akwanga and 17 in Karu LGAs and the team from the state government is still working to clear all waterways” the Environmental Officer added. Mohammed also described the flooding that submerged six structures along UAC road in Lafia on Saturday (Today) as unfortunate. He said the government had carried out sensitisation, advising people to clear drains in their areas and avoid building structures on waterways, but wondered why some people still do the contrary. “We have gone to UAC road this morning and have taken records of the number of houses and property affected and will submit a report for necessary action,” he said. Mohammed, however, thanked God that no life was lost in the unfortunate incident.

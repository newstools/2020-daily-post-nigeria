The Governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, may return to work on Wednesday. This follows the governor’s post on Twitter where he posted his pictures attending a thanksgiving service in his hometown. According to the governor, “We return all the glory to God and thank the people of Abia State for their prayers.” When DAILY POST reached out to the State Commissioner for Information, John Okiyi Kalu, on Ikpeazu’s resumption, he said, ” to the glory of God, his Excellency should return to office tomorrow. He is very okay.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-819502" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_6308.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="1334" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_6308.jpg 750w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_6308-169x300.jpg 169w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_6308-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"> <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-819503" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_6307.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="1334" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_6307.jpg 750w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_6307-169x300.jpg 169w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_6307-576x1024.jpg 576w" sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px">

The pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere has called for the sack of the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu. According to the group, the Minister’s decision for schools to remain closed in the country was a wrong move capable of destroying the country’s education sector. The group maintained that the country cannot afford to close down schools for a whole year. Recall that Adamu Adamu had on Wednesday said, in Abuja, that schools should remain closed until the COVID-19 pandemic was brought under control. Also, the Minister of State for Education, Mr Emeka Nwajiuba had earlier announced that the 2020 WASSCE conducted by WAEC would hold between August and September while the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 directed all the schools to resume for only graduating pupils but the Adamu’s order had reversed all the directives. According to Afenifere’s Secretary-General, Bashorun Sehinde Arogbofa, the Federal Government should have allowed pupils to resume and find means of protecting them against the spread of the deadly virus. He said, “Adamu Adamu should be sacked, he can not bring our school system back to the stone age. They had about six months to plan for these children, what did they do? The last six months all these children have been preparing for the WASSCE, what did the Federal Government do? “I think the two ministers in the ministry should go, why would one say the pupil should resume to write their papers in August and the other minister would come and reverse the order and that the school would be closed down for the whole year? “It is a reality that the COVID-19 is in the country but they should have envisaged what will happen and make necessary arrangements against it for the pupils. Why should education be closed down for a whole year? “It means the two of them (Adamu and the Minister of State for Education) don’t know what they are doing, so they should go.”

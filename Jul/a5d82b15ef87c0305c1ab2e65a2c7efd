A former vice-president of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, has recommended Dr. Ngozi Okonjo Iweala for the post of Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). In a tweet on Saturday, Atiku noted that her “experience and the enormous related works she has done confirms without equivocation that her leadership shall be a blessing to the WTO and the world”. Last month, the WTO had acknowledged Okonjo-Iweala as Nigeria’s nominee for the post. The former Minister of Finance was nominated by President Muhammadu Buhari. The current WTO Director-General, Roberto Azevêdo, has announced he will step down on August 31, 2020. Other nominees for the post include: Mr. Jesús Seade Kuri of Mexico, Mr. Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh of Egypt, Mr Tudor Ulianovschi of Moldova, Ms Amina C. Mohamed of Kenya, Mr Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijiri of Saudi Arabia and Dr Liam Fox of the United Kingdom.

An engineer, Abidemi Dada, on Friday told a Customary Court in Mapo, Oyo State, to dissolve his marriage of 13 years to Opeyemi because she denies him of sex. Testifying in court, Dada, a resident in Oke-Bola area of Ibadan, said: “My life has not been the same since she began the strange behaviour of constantly denying me of sex. ”My wife also ignored our pastor’s advice. There is no peace in our marriage. She also insults me,” he said. The President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade, urged the relatives of the couple to advise them. He also observed that there was still a sign of love between the pair and urged them to exercise patience with each other. Odumade, however, adjourned the case until 6 August for judgment, NAN reports.

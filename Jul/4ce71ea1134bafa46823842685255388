The Western Nigeria Security Network, code-named Amotekun in Osun State has apprehended a suspected robber, Mumeen Saheed with a sum of N1.2 million and jewelleries. The 36-year-old suspected robber, Mumeen was arrested on Friday in Osogbo while wandering around with the properties. According to the corps, the robber claimed to have stolen the N1.2 million since February from his former landlady, who lives at around Local Government Secretariat area of Shagamu but confessed to have spent part of it. He disclosed that he was the one taking care of the old woman, which allows him to get access to the womanâ€™s room. While questioning, Mumeen told Amotekun corps that he had kept the money in the bush while shuttling between Ibadan and Osogbo waiting for COVID 19 to end, so he could rent a house and settle down. The Field Commander of Amotekun, Comrade Amitolu Shittu, said, the properties recovered from the suspect have been handed over to the Nigeria Police, Oja-Oba Division, Osogbo, for further investigations. Also recovered from him were assorted charms and the picture of an expatriate he claimed was brought to him by a client for prayer. The field commander, who warned evildoers to be conscious of consequence, reiterated that the security outfit would not let down the people of Osun.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, was left fuming after his side lost 3-2 at West Ham on Wednesday night. Lampard blamed the defeat on “mistakes” made by his players and said they should have done better. The Blues went in front through a Willian penalty, before the Hammers struck twice through Tomas Soucek and Michail Antonio. Willian again equalized for Chelsea with a fantastic free-kick, but Andriy Yarmolenko struck a late winner in stoppage time. The result saw Lampard’s men flunk a chance to move up to third ahead of Leicester City. “It happens, it is the Premier League and if you make mistakes like we did, we dominated the game in terms of possession, but make mistakes and teams will hurt you. “I’m not happy with any of the goals. You don’t get given victories for scoring two goals, you have to be better than that,” Lampard told BBC.

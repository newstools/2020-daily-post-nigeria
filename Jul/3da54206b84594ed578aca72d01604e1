Governor of Kwara State, Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq has invited the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to conduct an independent probe into funds disbursed to the 16 local government councils in the state from May 2019 till date. The governor in a statement on Tuesday in Ilorin by his Chief Press Secretary, Rafiu Ajakaye also disclosed that a panel of inquiry comprising members from various backgrounds would also be set up to look into the local government funds. The call became necessary following claims by some persons that money to the tune of N300 million was diverted monthly from LG accounts. “For the sake of accountability and transparency, the governor is hereby, calling on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to conduct an urgent probe into funds so far received as allocations and spent by the 16 local governments between May 29 and now. The governor explained that the probe is to establish the fact that this administration has not touched a kobo of money belonging to the local governments. ”We have nothing to hide, but for the abundance of caution, the governor will be tasking, not just the EFCC, but also a panel of inquiry with members drawn from various backgrounds to investigate the LG funds, how they have been spent, and expose any mismanagement or diversion of the funds (if any). He also appealed to the House of Assembly to hold a public hearing on the said matter. “The governor restated that he would not be found mismanaging or siphoning public funds. “He insists that any official found to have diverted or mismanaged public funds under him would be made to account for the same as prescribed under the law,” the statement added.

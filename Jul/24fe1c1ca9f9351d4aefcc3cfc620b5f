A Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan, on Thursday dissolved a 14-year-old marriage between one Bukola Akinyode and Azeez on the grounds of reckless and extravagant lifestyle. The President of the court, Chief Ademola Odunade, held that the divorce was granted in the interest of peace and tranquility. Odunade awarded custody of the first two children to the respondent and the other two to the complainant. He directed Azeez to pay N10, 000 as the children’s monthly feeding allowance and in addition, be responsible for their education and other welfares. Earlier, Bukola, a trader who resides in Omi-Apata area of Ibadan, told the court that she was no longer willing to continue in the marriage with her husband anymore because of how he treats her, NAN reports. She added that her husband inflicts her with wounds using a machete whenever they argued. “Sometimes, Azeez locks me out, and I am forced to take refuge in a nearby mosque for safety. “Azeez lives a very extravagant life in the neighbourhood. He drinks with reckless abandonment without catering for his children. “His lifestyles often deceive people into believing that all is well with us without knowing that his wife and children are starving. “Besides, whenever my parents give me money to start a business, Azeez takes it from me,” Bukola added. The respondent consented to the suit but denied all the allegations levelled against him. However, Azeez, a truck driver, argued that he gave his consent for separation because his wife was troublesome to handle. “It is true that I sometimes borrow money from her and on each occasion I refunded her, but she keeps asking me as if I am a debtor. “The reason why I locked her out was because she is a disobedient wife. “After armed robbers attacked us one night, I decided that nobody should stay out late, but Bukola continued to attend to her customers who are mostly male,” Azeez said.

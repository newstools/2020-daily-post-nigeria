Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has refuted a purported response to his Imo State Counterpart, Governor Hope Uzodinma. Media reports had it that Wike had mocked Uzodinma over Edo Guber comments, alleging that he is an international fraudster He was alleged to have said “When governors are talking, Hope Uzodinma shouldn’t talk because he is an internationally recognized fraudster who stole a mandate that does not belong to him through the help of his APC cabals and tomorrow if democratically elected governors are talking, someone declared governor through the back door will come out and talk too”. But Commissioner for Information and Communications in the State, Paulinus Nsirim in a statement obtained by DAILY POST said the comments ascribed to Wike are false. He said the comments ascribed to Wike were fabricated by desperate people. According to the statement, “The attention of the Rivers State Government has been drawn to the news circulating in the Social Media that Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State denigrated his Imo State counterpart, Governor Hope Uzodinma. “The purveyors of the deliberate falsehood alleged that Governor Wike replied Governor Uzodinma over a recent statement where he allegedly boasted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will teach the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Governor Wike how to conduct a transparent election in the forthcoming Edo State gubernatorial election. “The concocted story only existed in the imagination of the authors and so there was also no disparaging comment by Governor Wike. “Members of the public are hereby advised to discountenance all the information contained in the said publication as they did not emanate from Governor Wike.”

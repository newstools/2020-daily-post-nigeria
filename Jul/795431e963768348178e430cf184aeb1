Russia has successfully carried out a human trial of COVID-19 vaccine. Vadim Tarasov, the Director of the Institute for Translational Medicine and Biotechnology, said the world’s first COVID-19 vaccine test was carried out by the Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University. Speaking with the country’s media platform, Sputnik, Tarasov said the vaccine was produced by Gamalei Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology on 18 June. Tarasov also disclosed that the first set of volunteers would be discharged on Wednesday while the second batch would be on July 20. “Sechenov University has successfully completed tests on volunteers of the world’s first vaccine against coronavirus”, Tarasov said. Recall that the World Health Organisation, WHO, had a few days ago said 19 potential COVID-19 vaccines were currently in clinical trials across the world.

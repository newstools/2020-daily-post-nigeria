Suspected political thugs in Edo State have attacked the residence of the Commissioner for Youths, Hon. Damian Lawani in Udaba Ekphei Community, Etsako West Local Government Area (LGA) of the state. Edo State Government had alerted the public on Monday, July 20, of alleged engagement of thugs by Comrade Oshiomhole and Captain Hosa Okunbo on the prompting of Ize-Iyamu, to cause mayhem in the state. In a statement sent to DAILY POST by the Special Assistant to the governor on media, the gunmen shot sporadically at the house at 11 pm, destroying several properties and leaving scores of Lawani’s family members with various degrees of injuries. The assailants also promised to return to inflict pains on the commissioner who was absent at his residence. They also dropped a message with the inscription: “Damian Lawani, you’re lucky we did not meet you at home. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-819976" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_01.jpeg" alt="" width="810" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_01.jpeg 810w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_01-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_01-768x1024.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"> “We promise that we are coming back for you. If you like, tighten security.” In a statement sent to DAILY POST, a resident on the condition of anonymity said the windows of the residence were shattered with bullets. Narrating the incident, the resident said, “The vehicle that brought them for the dastardly act was parked in front of the Udaba Ekphei Community Hall as it could not gain access to the road to Damian Lawani’s residence because of its deplorable nature from the tarred road. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-819977" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_03.jpeg" alt="" width="810" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_03.jpeg 810w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_03-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DSC_03-768x1024.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"> “A generator powered in Lawani’s compound for pumping water for a motorised borehole in the place created the impression of Lawani’s presence in Udaba Ekphei Community. “Perhaps, their informant(s) in the community on sighting the light in his compound thought that the commissioner was around and therefore, wrongly informed his or her principal(s) that Lawani was in the village. Hence, they came at about 11pm to carry out the dastardly act. “The Udaba Ekphei community residents could not come out as a result of the sporadic gunshots. But we thank God that Hon. Damian Lawani was not actually around for the assailants to accomplish their devilish mission”, he added.

The Kwara State Muslim faithful will on Friday know the position of the state government on the forthcoming Eid- el- Kabir festival. The Chief Press Secretary to the state governor, Rafiu Ajakaye, disclosed this in a statement in Ilorin, on Wednesday, shortly after the meeting between the government and Muslim leaders in the state. DAILY POST gathered that deliberations at the meeting were centred on the spike in COVID-19 cases, the need for enforcement of rules, and the forthcoming Eid-el-Kabir, the Islamic feast in which animals are slaughtered. According to the statement, “The government deeply appreciates the rich contributions of the eminent scholars, their support and appreciation of the government’s efforts and will on Friday, July 24, 2020, make a pronouncement on the Eid-el-Kabir prayer after due consultations.” Ajakaye, who is also the spokesman of the state COVID-19 technical committee, said: “The committee, meanwhile, is scheduled to hold various consultative meetings with the leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, market associations, transport unions, and bankers between Thursday and Friday to strengthen compliance with safety protocols amid rising cases.” The Chairman of the state COVID-19 technical committee and the Deputy Governor of the state, Kayode Alabi, chaired the meeting with the Muslim leaders and attended by a cross-section of top government officials and prominent Muslim scholars. The Muslim delegation was led by the Imam Imale of Ilorin, Sheikh Abdullahi Abdulhameed, Chief Imam of Offa, Sheikh Muhydeen Husayn, Justice Salihu Oloruntoyin Muhammed, Justice Abdulmutallab Ahmad Ambali, Professor Badmus Yusuf, Justice Idris Abdullahi Haroon and Dr Abdulrazaq Amuda. DAILY POST reports that anxiety must have been raised following the decision by the Kano State government to cancel the Muslim festival coupled with the recent frightening spike in COVID-19 infectious in the state.

The federal government has warned church leaders, Christians and other Nigerians over “reckless confidence” towards the efficacy of COVID-19. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, stated this on Sunday, while speaking at the interdenominational church prayer service against COVID-19 held at the National Ecumenical Centre, Abuja. Mustapha bemoaned the disregard to COVID-19 prevention guidelines/protocols especially at various worship centres. “You can see that this virus has confounded and confused the entire world,” Mustapha said. “It has brought the democracies and economies that existed for the last 300 years to their knees. It has overwhelmed them and what makes you think that it cannot overwhelm us? “The Church should stop the exhibition of reckless confidence and tell their congregations to do the proper thing which stays safe for themselves, their families and the body of Christ,” he said. The service was attended by church leaders and Christians from different denominations, as well as officials of the Nigerian Government led by the SGF. There are currently 28,617 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria.

The South-South Governors Forum have declared support for the forensic audit of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari. The Governors also expressed concern over the crisis rocking the NDDC. Chairman of the South-South Governors Forum and Delta State Governor, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, in a statement, said they are convinced and expecting that the audit would serve to put the NDDC on a sound corporate governance footing and reposition it to better deliver on its mandate. The Governors also declared their support for the ongoing investigation of the commission by the Senate, adding that the Upper chamber is operating within its oversight functions through the ad hoc committee set up for that purpose. According to the Governors, “It behoves on us to respect the Senate oversight function and allow it to discharge this responsibility in a fair, transparent and equitable manner. “The South-South Governors are desirous to see an NDDC that is fully alive and responsive to its mandate of accelerating infrastructural development of the Niger Delta region and enhancing the general living conditions of our people. Hence, we will not hesitate to give our unqualified support to any policy initiative that will make this a reality. “The Forum wishes to advise the combatants in the current crisis in the NDDC to refrain from utterances and actions that will breach the peace and security of the region.” The South-South Governors also condemned the attempted arrest of Joi Nunieh, saying it was unwarranted, unnecessary and uncalled for.

Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has named Cristiano Ronaldo the most skilful team-mate he has ever played with. Both footballers feature for the Portugal national team. United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, recently revealed that Ronaldo recommended Fernandes to be signed. Speaking with BT Sport, Fernandes expressed his admiration for the Juventus forward and how he has adapted his game as he got older. He said: “Cristiano – more in the first years of his career he was one of the most skilful players in the world. “I think he changed his game a little bit, but he’s still a player who is really difficult to defend against. “For me, for everyone I have played with and against, I think he is the most skilful player I have ever seen.” Fernandes has become an instant hit at Old Trafford since his January arrival, scoring eight times.

Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources has vowed that the All Progressives Congress, APC, would reclaim Edo State. Sylva said APC would reclaim Edo State because it was taken away through the back door by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. He spoke at APC’s National Secretariat after the inaugural meeting of the Contract and Mobilisation Committee of the APC National Campaign Council for Edo State Governorship Election in Abuja, on Tuesday. Sylva, who is the Chairman of the committee said: “Edo State is a must win for APC. “All of us in the South South believe that this election must be won. Edo state is our only APC state in the South South. “A few months ago, as you are all aware, they took Bayelsa State from us through the back door after we won the election and now through the back door again, they have taken Edo state but luckily we have the opportunity of reclaiming Edo state in a few weeks from now and every south south APC member is of the consensus that we must reclaim Edo. “Edo State is our stronghold in the region and therefore we are all geared up, we will all go to Edo state. We want to assure you that you should not entertain any doubt that Edo state will be an APC state very soon come the election in September.” The state Governor, Godwin Obaseki had defected from APC to the PDP, following irreconcilable differences with Adams Oshiomhole, immediate past National Chairman of the party.

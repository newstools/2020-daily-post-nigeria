The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Director of Operations, Mohammed Umar, has been picked to oversee the affairs of the commission in the absence of its suspended acting chairman, Ibrahim Magu. This was disclosed to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) by a top official of EFCC on Tuesday. NAN reports that the source, who wished to be anonymous, claimed Umar was chosen by the “EFCC’s hierarchy” after Magu was suspended. The source, however, disclosed the commission had not received any official communication on Magu’s suspension. A presidential committee is currently probing the activities of EFCC under Magu. This followed an indictment by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. On Monday, Magu was picked up by security operatives said to be from the Department of State Services, DSS, and taken to the Presidential Villa, Abuja as part of the ongoing investigation. EFCC’s Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, however, said Magu was only invited for questioning.

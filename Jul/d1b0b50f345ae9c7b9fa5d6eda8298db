The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Campaign Council in Edo State has condemned Saturday’s attack on Governor Godwin Obaseki’s entourage at the Oba of Benin Palace. Chairman of the party campaign council, Chief Dan Orbih, who addressed journalists in Benin City on Sunday, said, “the attack was a plot to eliminate Governor Obaseki, national officials of PDP and some PDP governors.” He also stated that the attackers’ aim was to “drive fear to Governor Obaseki and the people, so that they will not come out on election day.” Orbih, who further described the attack as a political mutiny, called on security agents to ensure that those connected with the attack are arrested and prosecuted. Gunshots were fired and cars smashed during the mayhem, while scores of persons sustained varying injuries. Orbih accused the opposition All Progressives Party (APC) leadership and sponsors of masterminding the mayhem. The PDP officials had accompanied the Edo governor to the palace to intimate the monarch, Oba Ewuare II of governor Obaseki’s intention to seek reelection on September 19. Whilst at the palace, some youths gathered at the palace entrance gate chanting pro and anti-PDP songs. Continuing, Orbih said: “PDP visit was officially communicated to the palace, various security agencies and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) guidelines. According to him, “From official records, the APC has no event anywhere in the State yesterday (Saturday). “The attack was carefully organized to eliminate the entire PDP leadership in Nigeria and it’s capable of breeding inter-State war because of the targeted governors. “Those wearing PDP-sponsored caps and emblems were attacked. And it must be condemned by well-meaning Nigerians,” he added.

Napoli president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, has raised concerns about his club travelling to face Barcelona in the Champions League, amid a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in Spain. The match is scheduled for August 8 at the Camp Nou. The first leg of the last-16 tie ended 1-1 in Naples in February. The winner will advance to the quarter-finals in Lisbon, Portugal. “I hear a lot of perplexity and fear coming from Spain and they’re acting like nothing is wrong,” De Laurentiis told reporters. “What does it take to say, ‘Don’t go to Barcelona but rather go to Portugal, Germany or Geneva?’ “If they’ve decided to play the Champions League in Portugal and the Europa League in Germany, I think we can go to Portugal or Germany for the round of 16. “I don’t understand why it should stay in a city that has a really critical situation.”

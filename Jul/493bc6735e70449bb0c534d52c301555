Juventus head coach, Maurizio Sarri, has said that AC Milan defeated his side 4-2 in the Serie A fixture on Tuesday night because his team only played well in the first 60 minutes of the encounter. He also said that there was no point dwelling on their ‘total blackout’ against AC Milan, adding that Juventus need to focus on their next game in three days. Juventus wasted the opportunity to move ten points clear at the top of Serie A table as they blew a two-goal lead to lose 4-2 to AC Milan at San Siro. Adrien Rabiot and Cristiano Ronaldo put the visitors ahead early in the second half, but Sarri’s men were then blown away by a brilliant Milan display as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Franck Kessie, Rafael Leao and Ante Rebic scored for the host. “I think our first 60 minutes were world-class. We were in total control and had this blackout,” Sarri told DAZN. “There is not even much use thinking too much about it, because we have another game in three days. “It is usually not even possible to find the reasons for these inexplicable blackouts.” Sarri added: “Sitting here trying to over-analyse it or put ourselves on trial could be counter-productive and make us lose all the good work we have done so far. “It is completely different from the defeats against Verona and Napoli, so we have to focus on the next match. This’s a team that has excellent football in its capabilities, and that is what we need to build on.” The defeat against AC Milan means Juventus are now seven points ahead of second-place Lazio on the Serie A table after 31 games. Juventus will face Atalanta on Saturday in their next Serie A fixture.

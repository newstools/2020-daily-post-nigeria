President Muhammadu Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, has said the invitation of the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, by the Justice Ayo Salami-led Presidential panel was in his best interest. Adesina stated this while speaking on Channels Television’s ‘Politics Today’ programme on Wednesday. According to him, Magu was only invited to tell his side of the story. On whether Magu’s 10-day detention was illegal, Adesina said: “if anything illegal has been done, there are ways to seek redress for it. However, I think it is in the best interest of everybody, including Magu, for the panel to have invited him to hear his side of the story. “I can tell you on authority that before this became a public issue, the panel had been sitting for weeks. When the panel established some grounds for Mr. Magu to be invited, President Buhari then gave approval for him to be invited and he was invited and he came.” Adesina also noted that Magu, who was released on bail on Wednesday, was told to step aside to allow for a proper investigation.

Manchester United are close to tying up a £100million deal to sign Borussia Dortmund star Jadon Sancho, the UK Sun reports. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, wants the England international to join his attacking ranks and line up alongside compatriots Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood. With the Bundesliga side adamant on their £100million valuation, the Red Devils are ready to complete the transfer. United have made Sancho one of their principal targets when the summer transfer window opens on July 27. The club’s chief executive, Ed Woodward, earlier this year admitted they “were not immune” from the financial implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. Sancho’s current £190,000-a-week contract with Dortmund runs until 2022.

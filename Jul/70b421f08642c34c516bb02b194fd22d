A former Barcelona right back, Dani Alves, has revealed that captain Lionel Messi needs more support at Camp Nou. Alves who now plays for São Paulo in the Brazilian league, also said that the present Barcelona squad lacks identity on the pitch like ‘Ronaldinho’s Barca’. The Brazil captain stated this while reacting to Barcelona’s 2-1 defeat to Osasuna that saw Real Madrid being crowned La Liga champions on Thursday. “What this Barça lacks is the identity it has always had, like Ronaldinho’s Barça, our Barça. The identity of a team that dominates for 90 minutes, 100 minutes, or 150 minutes,” Alves told Catalunya Radio. “Barça are there for people to enjoy. Now what I see, from the outside, is that Barça are just another team. They used to have an understanding throughout the team and made things look easy. “Leo is a natural winner. He doesn’t like losing. When the team loses it’s normal, he gets angry, he always wants to win, just like me. We always want to win. “He sees what I feel, and that’s a lack of support. I’ll always say that Messi is the main course and we were the perfect ingredients for that plate. Now I have the feeling that he’s doing everything, all the time, and we must remember he’s only human.”

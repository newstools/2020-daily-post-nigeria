The senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has criticised the All Progressives Congress, APC, for selling its nomination form for N22.5 million and yet opting for the indirect mode of primary election in Ondo State. DAILY POST reported yesterday that the APC had opted for the indirect mode of primary election for Ondo State come July 20. However, Giwa while reacting to the reports, called on the APC to reverse its decision to give other aspirants fair treatment The cleric said all the participants including the governor of Ondo State, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu should be allowed to test their popularity through a direct primary mode of election. Currently, twelve aspirants are jostling for the governorship ticket of the APC in Ondo State. Eleven out of the 12 aspirants are calling the party to organize a direct primary election with promises to support anybody who emerges. He said, “I think the APC needs to treat all aspirants jostling for the governorship ticket fairly. “If you are popular, you don’t need to be afraid of the direct primary election because the system allows a popular candidate to emerge. “I read that each aspirant pays N22.5 million for the APC forms. If they had it in mind to conduct indirect primary, why did they ask them to pay such a huge amount of money? “You can’t manage a crisis by handpicking somebody just the way the Peoples Democratic Party is doing. “However, the Ondo State people would not accept any imposition of an incompetent candidate.”

The United States Department for Justice has claimed that Ramon Olorunwa Abbas aka Hushpuppi, tried to defraud an English Premier League club. In a statement posted on its website on Friday, the US Attorney’s Office also confirmed that Hushpuppi has arrived in Chicago from Dubai, UAE. He has also made his first court appearance in the US and is expected to be transferred to Los Angeles in some weeks. “A Dubai resident who flaunted his extravagant lifestyle on social media has arrived in the United States to face criminal charges alleging he conspired to launder hundreds of millions of dollars from business email compromise (BEC) frauds and other scams, including schemes targeting a U.S. law firm, a foreign bank and an English Premier League soccer club. “Ramon Olorunwa Abbas, 37, a.k.a. “Ray Hushpuppi” and “Hush,” a Nigerian national, arrived in Chicago Thursday evening after being expelled from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Abbas made his initial U.S. court appearance this morning in Chicago, and he is expected to be transferred to Los Angeles in the coming weeks,” part of the statement read. Hushpuppi and Olakekan Jacob known as Woodberry, were extradited to the United States, after they were apprehended by Dubai Police, following investigations in several online fraud targeting individuals and companies.

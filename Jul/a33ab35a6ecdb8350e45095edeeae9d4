Bayer Leverkusen midfielder, Kai Havertz, wants a move to Chelsea this summer’s transfer window. Havertz has already agreed on personal terms with Chelsea to move to Stamford Bridge this summer. This was disclosed by a respected football journalist, Angelo Mangiante, who works for Sky Sports. “Personal terms have already been agreed. Kai #Haverts just wants to join #Chelsea. No other team. “In a few days, there’ll be the official bid from Chelsea to find the agreement with Bayer Leverkusen around €80M. Talks ongoing very fast,” Mangiante wrote on Twitter on Monday. Meanwhile, Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has admitted his admiration for Havertz but insists the club has not made an offer for the Germany international. The Blues boss said: “No, no bids have gone in. He is obviously a top player, but we are certainly not going to comment on other players at other teams, and it cannot be our focus. Nothing to say.”

The Federal Government Special Public Work Selection Committee in Osun State has denied hosting Website for the recruitment of the 774, 000 Special Public Work facilitated by the Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment as palliative to cushion the economic effect of the COVID-19 in Nigeria. The committee said neither the Federal ministry of labour, the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) nor the state selection committee have the knowledge of the job recruitment website and warned members of the public not to fall victim of fraudsters. The committee explained that the website of the special public works programme www.specialpublicworks.gov.ng is only for information and not for recruitment. The Osun State Chairman of Selection Committee, Ambassador Abdulyekeen Abilagbo said this after the meeting of the committee held at the Conference Hall of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), in Osogbo, the state capital. He said the selection committee is still expecting the guidelines and selection modalities from the federal ministry of labour and employment. The retired diplomat said the clarification became necessary following several reports of an existing fake NDE website for the recruitment. Abdulyekeen, however, assured the members of the public that the selection committee will publicly announce the modalities for application and recruitment when the guidelines are released. Other members of the state selection committee at the meeting included the Aragbiji of Iragbiji, Abdulrasheed Olabomi, the Olufi of Gbongan, Odugbemi Adetoyese, Adimula of Ifewara, Hezekiah Adeniyi Owolola, Chairman Osun Christen Association of Nigeria (CAN), Bishop Amos Ogunrinade. Others are the Chairman, Osun State Chapter of Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) Alhaji Olawuyi Mustapha, State Commissioner for Human Resources and Capacity Building, Alhaja Lateefat Giwa, State Coordinator of NDE, Mr Ismail Yekeen and representatives of other stakeholders.

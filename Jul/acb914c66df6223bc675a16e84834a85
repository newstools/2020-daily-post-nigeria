The Kaduna State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has arrested a pastor identified as Apostle Joseph Alhassan , for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl for five years. Alhassan, who is the pastor of Faith Agape Church, Narayi Kaduna State, was arrested at his residence, No 158 B, Abdulrahman Road, Shagari Low Cost, Barnawa Kaduna. The suspect was arrested following a complaint filed by the Kaduna State Ministry of Human Services and Social Development. Speaking on the incident, the victim (name withheld), told Social Welfare Officer-in-charge of the case, Ms. Brenda Bartholomew, that Alhassan sexually abused her over the last five years. According to Bartholomew, the victim, from Saminaka, Lere Local Government Area of the state, had been living with the accused since she was 11 years old as a house-help. She explained that after receiving the information, the victim was taken to the Sexual Assault Referral Centre, Kakuri, for medical examination. On her part, the Executive Director, Bridge that Gap Initiative, Ms Gloria Bulus, told NAN that she found out about the victim’s predicament through a neighbour’s child who attended same school with the victim. “In late October 2019, we heard that a 12-year-old girl, also a house-help in Alhassan’s house, had told some of her friends at school that her fellow house-help was being sexually molested by Alhassan. “We decided to visit the school, Aliyu Makama Primary School, Barnawa, to investigate the alleged crime. We met the Assistant Head Teacher, Mrs. Rebecca Sambo, who claimed ignorance of the issue but the victim reaffirmed the allegation and we were able to contact her parents in Kagarko, who came and took her away. When contacted, the NSCDC Kaduna State confirmed the incident, adding that matter was being investigated. Meanwhile, Alhassan denied committing the crime. He maintained that the allegation was baseless.

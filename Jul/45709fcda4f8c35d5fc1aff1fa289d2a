The Chief Magistrate, Prince Mutairu Oare, admitted the defendants to a N100, 000 bail with one surety in like sum. He said that the surety must be responsible and depose to an affidavit of means. Oare also said that the sureties must deposit two recent passport photographs of themselves and that of the defendants with the court.

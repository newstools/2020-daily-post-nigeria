Members of the Caretaker Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday, met the National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu behind closed doors. Tinubu hosted Mai Mala Buni-led caretaker committee members at his residence in the Ikoyi area of Lagos State. Yobe State Governor, Buni, who is the new APC Caretaker Committee Chairman, as well as Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, the Chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum, led other members to the meeting Tinubu, who addressed journalists at the end of the meeting, said it was “a consultation to move by the party following the recent disagreements among some aggrieved members.” The former Lagos State Governor, however, denied any report of differences or rancour from his side. But he maintained that there was no way a large political party such as the APC would not experience dissent. The Secretary of APC Caretaker Committee, Senator Akpan Udo-Edehe, as well as the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu were the others in the meeting.

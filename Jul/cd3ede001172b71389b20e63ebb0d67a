These items are being distributed across the federation based on the number of COVID-19 cases per region. Accu-Chek is a leading provider of blood sugar monitoring systems and insulin pumps; with more than 40 years of experience in helping people living with diabetes to track and manage their blood sugar levels so that they have better control of their health.

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said he is not picking Mesut Ozil for “pure football reasons”. Arteta, speaking during a virtual press conference today, denied the Gunners were desperate to offload their highest earner. Ozil has not featured for Arsenal since lockdown, with the official club explanation given as “back soreness”. Ahead of a FA Cup semi-final against Manchester City on Saturday, Arteta refused to confirm if Ozil will play at Wembley but acknowledged he was training with the squad. “Pure football reasons,” he replied when asked why Ozil has not been selected. “My only ambition is the best squad and the best players who give us the best opportunity to win the game.”

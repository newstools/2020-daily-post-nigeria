Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has promoted youngster, Ethan Laird, to the first squad ahead of his side’s Premier League clash with Bournemouth on Saturday at Old Trafford, MEN reports. Laird, who plays at right-back, is highly rated at the Red Devils. The 18-year-old has already made two appearances in the Europa League against AZ Alkmaar and Astana in the group stages at the end of last year. His promotion became necessary after Solskjaer on Friday confirmed that two of his first-team defenders, Phil Jones and Axel Tuanzebe would be out of action until September. “Phil and Axel will still be out for a little while,” Solskjaer said. “It will be a few weeks before Phil can start training and Axel, we won’t probably see them play until September.”

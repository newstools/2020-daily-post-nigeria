Senator Ifeanyi Ubah, representing Anambra South district of Anambra State in the Nigeria Senate, has urged the leadership of the Senate to as a matter of urgency review the over 136 checkpoints/roadblocks between Ijebu Ode and Onitsha head bridge with a view to scaling them down, especially, in light of the unconstitutional breaches, humiliation and hardship inflicted upon motorists and travelers plying the roads. He posited that these offensive and dangerous roadblocks can be replaced with high tech patrol teams and effective surveillance and communication systems on the highways. Senator Ubah, who alarmed the red chamber at its plenary session, Wednesday, and monitored by DAILY POST, at a live television broadcast, Wednesday, on the urgent need to reduce the high number of Roadblocks/Checkpoints between Ijebu Ode and Onitsha Head Bridge. The chieftain of Young Progressives Party, YPP, also emphasized that the incessant retinue of checkpoints spanning over 136 roadblocks between Ijebu Ode and Onitsha head bridge have outlived its usefulness, in terms of curbing security breaches as they now serve as conduit pipes for extortion and intimidation. He said, “I came under Order 43 of the Senate rules to raise a complaint about the increasingly worrisome number of roadblocks/checkpoints mounted by the Nigerian Police Force, Nigerian Army and other paramilitary security agencies between Ijebu Ode and Onitsha head bridge. “The number of checkpoints between Ijebu Ode and Onitsha head bridge are even more than checkpoints in Boko haram infested areas in the North, which makes one wonder if southeastern roads are in a state of war/emergency.” Continuing Ubah said, “While acknowledging the issue of insecurity in Nigeria that has necessitated increased security presence, we cannot fail to condemn the increasing militarization of our roads. These multiple roadblocks/security checkpoints, coupled with the rough condition of roads leading to the south-east region, are causing unnecessary traffic buildup with untold hardship on road users. “This matter which has been on the front burner of National discourse has reduced the ease of doing business and inter-state commercial activities in the region, “he asserted.

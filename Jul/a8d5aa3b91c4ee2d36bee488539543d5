Atletico Madrid head coach, Diego Simeone, has responded to Chelsea’s interest in the Los Rojiblancos goalkeeper, Jan Oblak. DAILY POST had reported that Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has made Jan Oblak, his No.1 target this summer. Lampard is not pleased with current Blues first-choice, Kepa Arrizabalaga, who has struggled this term and is now looking for replacements. Reacting to the development, Simeone said he was not surprised, adding that the best clubs in the world always come for his players every year. Asked about the speculation on Wednesday at his pre-match press conference ahead of Atletico Madrid’s clash with Getafe, Simeone said as quoted by Metro UK: “It doesn’t surprise me, every year our most important players are wanted by the best in the world. “It’s normal to always look for the best – and we have many. Some have left, and others have stayed. “It’s logical and normal that anyone wants Oblak. “He is our captain and an important player. I hope we can count on his work, which is enormous for Atleti.” Oblak, 27, has a £120m buy-out clause in his contract which will expire in 2023.

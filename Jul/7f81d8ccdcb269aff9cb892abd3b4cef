The Emir of Gusau, Alhaji Ibrahim Bello has confirmed that most house owners in Zamfara State have been renting and selling houses to notorious bandits and kidnappers. He said the development had contributed immensely to the inability of the security agencies to fight banditry in the State. Addressing the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, who was in his palace for a courtesy call, the Emir explained that “There are lots of bandits who are currently occupying houses in various towns and villages in the state either as tenants or owners of the houses. “Some people are busy renting or selling houses to these criminals “They sleep with us and early in the morning sneak out to go and carry out their inhuman activities.” The emir appealed to the security agencies to use their intelligence and focus their security lenses in fishing out those selling houses or renting them to criminals in order to bring them to justice. Bello also called on the people of the state to assist the security agencies to fish out those people responsible for aiding and abating banditry in the state. In his reaction, Adamu commended the Emir for his elderly advice, stressing that he was in the state based on the instruction by President Muhammadu Buhari . “The President instructed me to come to Zamfara for me to know what is really happening and what I need to do in order to stop banditry,” the police boss said.

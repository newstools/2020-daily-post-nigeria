Manchester United forward, Mason Greenwood, on Saturday evening surpassed Cristiano Ronaldo’s goal-scoring record at the club. Greenwood scored twice as Man United defeated Bournemouth 5-2 in the Premier League at Old Trafford. The England youngster has now scored 15 goals for the Red Devils in his first full season so far. In doing so, the 18-year-old eclipsed Ronaldo’s record of six goals in 2003/2004 and two off Wayne Rooney’s tally the next season, MEN reports. Meanwhile, speaking after Man United’s victory against Bournemouth, Greenwood’s teammate, Marcus Rashford, hailed his fellow compatriot for his brilliant display against the visitors. Rashford said: “I don’t want to put too much emphasis on him, just let him play his football and that is what he does. It is a big bonus to have him in the squad.”

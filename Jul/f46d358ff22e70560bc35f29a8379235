According to Zidane, Real Madrid have to be careful with the former Chelsea star, adding that he is an essential player and will soon be in good shape. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Zidane released a 24-man squad to tackle Getafe at the Estadio Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium but omitted Hazard from the list. Speaking on why he excluded Hazard from Real Madrid’s squad to clash with Getafe, Zidane said as quoted by Real Madrid’s official website: “We know what kind of player he is, and he’s essential to us. “Our opponents know that too. Let’s hope that there’s no attempt to hurt a player. “The opponent always wants to play strong against us. We have to be careful with him because he’s been out of the game with a lot of problems. “We have to go easy on him. He is going to be in good shape soon.” —

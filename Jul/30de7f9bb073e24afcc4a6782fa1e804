The Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, has approved the appointment of Dr. Daniel Ismaila Shagah as the new Hama Bachama. Daniel Shagah, a retired director of National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), was selected for the Bachama throne following the demise of Honest Irmiya Stephen, the 28th Hama Bachama, who died last month. “Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, while congratulating the new Hama Bachama, commended the kingmakers for a peaceful process that informed the choice of Dr. Shagah,” a statement from the Government House in Yola said. The statement which was released Wednesday afternoon by Humwashi Hunosikou, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, said the governor was confident that as a trained narcotics officer and technocrat, Daniel Shagah would lead his people aright. “I believe he will build on the legacies of late Honest Stephen who stood tall during his reign in peacebuilding initiatives,” the Governor said of the new Hama Bachama. The Hama Bachama is a first-class king with traditional authority over the Bachama people who are spread mostly in the two local government areas of Numan and Lamurde, Adamawa State.

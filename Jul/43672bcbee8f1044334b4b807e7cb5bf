Gal Pissetzky, Lawyer to the alleged international fraudster, Ramon Abbas also known as Hushpuppi, has told the court that the Nigerian is not a fraudster. Pissetzky said that the internet celebrity is a legitimate businessman who deals on real estate, according to Forbes. Hushpuppi’s lawyer made the claims while speaking with Forbes on Thursday insisting that his client is “Absolutely not guilty of (the) charges they are accusing him of.” He said that the Nigerian “was running a legitimate business and a very legitimate Instagram account and did not take part in any scam or fraud.” When asked to explain how Hushpuppi funded his extravagant lifestyle, the lawyer said, “He’s an entrepreneur. He has real estate involvement … (he’s) an Instagram personality. He was promoting brands and that’s how he was very legitimately making his money.” Hushpuppi was recently arrested in Dubai, United Arab Emirate, UAE on June 10 over charges of fraud  and was said to have defrauded 1,926,400 people. He was later extradited to the US where he is now being tried for fraud.

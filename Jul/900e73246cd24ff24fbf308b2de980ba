The Governor’s spokesman observed that despite the heavy presence of the military and relentless offensives against the bandits, the wanton killings and maiming by bandits were still increasing. “However, our honesty and focus on the reconciliation deal saw the near total drop in bandit attacks which allowed our roads, markets, schools and farms to be reopened, ” he said. Zailani noted that as a result of the reconciliation with the bandits by his administration, over one thousand persons were released by the ex-bandits and weapons willingly surrendered.

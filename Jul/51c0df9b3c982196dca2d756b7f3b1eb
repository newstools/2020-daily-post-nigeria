The embattled Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi on Tuesday accused his boss, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of sponsoring attacks on him. According to Ajayi, the governor funded some of the aspirants within the People’s Democratic Party, PDP to purchase the party’s nomination form in order to undermine the chances of the PDP at the polls. He emphasized that the attacks were launched to smear his reputation ahead of the July 22, 2020 governorship primaries of the PDP. Recall that protest had rocked the party’s secretariat on Monday following allegation by supporters of some of the PDP aspirants that Ajayi had connived with some persons within the party to doctor the delegates list. Ajayi who spoke through his Media Adviser, Allen Sowore stated that the attacks might not be unconnected to the “fact that the Akeredolu-led government has so far found it arduous to come out of coma and fill the gap the exit of the Deputy Governor created. While reacting to Ajayi’s allegation of Akeredolu sponsoring PDP aspirants against him, one of the aspirants, Dr. Eddy Olafeso said the deputy governor is entitled to his opinion. Olafeso who reacted through his campaign team Publicity Secretary, Ayo Fadaka, said that, “Our State has been terribly mismanaged by the Akeredolu/Agboola Ajayi administration and what we desire absolutely is a clean break from this ineffectual team and enthrone an administration that will be effectual in charting a new developmental agenda for our State.”

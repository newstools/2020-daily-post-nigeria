The Nigerian Air Force has revealed the identity of the killer of the late Flying Officer Tolulope Arotile. NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Ibikunle Daramola, made this known during a press conference on Sunday in Abuja. The late Flying Officer was Nigeria’s first female combat pilot. Daramola identified Arotile’s ex-classmate who drove the car that hit her as ‘Mr. Nehemiah Adejoh’. He further noted that the matter will be handed over to the police. “Mr Nehemiah Adejoh, Mr Igbekele Folorunsho and Mr Festus Gbayegun, drove past her in a Kia Sorento SUV, with Registration Number AZ 478 MKA. It is noteworthy that Mr Adejoh, Folorunsho and Gbayegun are all civilians who live outside NAF Base Kaduna, but were on their way to visit one Mrs Chioma Ugwu, wife of Squadron Leader Chukwuemeka Ugwu, who lives at Ekagbo Quarters on the Base. “Upon recognising their schoolmate, Arotile, after passing her, Mr Adejoh, who was driving, reversed the vehicle, ostensibly in an attempt to quickly meet up with the deceased, who was walking in the opposite direction. In the process, the vehicle struck Flying Officer Arotile from the rear, knocking her down with significant force and causing her to hit her head on the pavement. The vehicle then ran over parts of her body as it veered off the road beyond the kerb and onto the pavement, causing her further injuries,” Daramola said. A former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, had earlier rubbished the Air Force account of how Arotile died. “The idea that she was killed after being knocked down on the Airforce Base by her best friends car is nonsensical. “Who is this best friend and what is his/her name? I suspect that Tolu was murdered & the truth is being covered up. I urge the Chief of Air Staff to investigate this matter thoroughly,” Fani-Kayode had said.

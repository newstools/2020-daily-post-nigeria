West Ham United are in talks to sign former Super Eagles captain, Mikel Obi, according to Tribal Football. The Nigerian midfielder became a free agent in March, after terminating his contract with Turkish side, Trabzonspor. Mikel Obi left the club after refusing to play following the COVID-19 outbreak. The 33-year-old who has previously played for Chelsea and Middlesbrough in England has also been linked with Championship side, West Brom. But it is understood the Hammers are already in talks with him. After quitting Trabzonspor, Mikel Obi had been strongly linked with Brazilian sides, Botafogo and Internacional, with the player himself confirming the interest. However, it seems he is set to make a return to English football.

Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has warned corrupt politicians on the impending wrath of God. Bamgbose gave the warning in his goodwill message to Muslim faithful as they celebrate the Eid-el-Kabir. He said it was an opportunity to remind the elective officers, to eschew greed and selfishness, adding that Prophet Ibrahim exhibited selflessness and willingness to sacrifice all he had to God, even his only son. “Our elective officers and people in position of authority should emulate the good example of the Prophet,” he said in a statement on Thursday. “Eid-el-Kabir is an Arabic phrase for ‘Feast of Sacrifice’. Our leaders should be prepared to sacrifice their ‘insatiable urge’ to acquire this and that, for the common good of the society. “The reckless looting of our treasury should be stopped. Allah won’t spare any corrupt leader on the last day. They should imbibe the fear of God in whatever they do, knowing that God will ask them to account for their stewardship at the end of their journey on earth. “This is also a time to warn our President, Muhammadu Buhari not to condone corruption, no matter who is involved. He will be held accountable on the last day. This time of celebration, should be a time of reflection for all Muslim faithfuls. “Life is not all about acquisition but achievement. We shall all be remembered by what we have done. We must resist all attempts, to allow corruption to take a center stage. “Let’s be ever prepared to sacrifice for the common good of the citizens. Corruption won’t prolong life but shorten it. Let’s bid corruption farewell in Nigeria,” he said.

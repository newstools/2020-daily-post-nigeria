The federal government has threatened to impose a fresh lockdown in another two weeks. This follows the increasing rate of COVID-19 cases in the country, especially among people in authority. Chairman of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, on Monday lamented that it was directly affecting governance and security in the country. Mustapha, speaking at the task force press briefing in Abuja, admitted the possibility of ordering a fresh total lockdown to curtail further spread of the virus.
He, however, said events of coming weeks would determine the next line of action. “We will not speculate on what will happen in future, but we will protect the lives of Nigerians. “To achieve that, if it means to lock down again, we will not shy away from that responsibility. “We will recommend to the President who will look at the report and take a decision on our recommendation. What happens in the next two three weeks will determine what we will do,” Mustapha said. Mustapha’s warning comes after Governors David Umahi of Ebonyi, Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta and Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo, recently contracted the virus.

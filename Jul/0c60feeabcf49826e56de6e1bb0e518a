The Osun State Government has commiserated with Ondo State Governor, Mr. Rotimi Akeredolu, and the people of Ondo State, over the death of the State’s Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro. Adegbenro was said to have died of COVID-19 complications at the state Infectious Disease Hospital, IDH in Akure, Ondo State capital on Thursday The State Government, in a statement signed by the Honorable Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Mrs. Funke Egbemode, described the death of Dr. Adegbenro as unfortunate, given the conditions that necessitated it. She further said: “the Health Commissioner who doubled as Chairman of the Inter-ministerial Committee on COVID-19 in the State, was undoubtedly a critical front liner in the fight against COVID-19. His demise is, therefore, a great loss to Ondo State. “It is on record that until his demise, Dr. Adegbenro pulled his weight as a distinguished medical professional to dutifully serve Ondo State”. Egbemode further commiserated with Governor Akeredolu for the loss of one of his aides, whose role in the government is critical to the health emergency that the State and the nation at large were dealing with at the time. She, therefore, sympathised with the families of Dr. Adegbenro and the entire people of Ondo State, praying that God grants them the fortitude to bear the loss.

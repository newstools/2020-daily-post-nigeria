Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, could be facing an injury crisis in midfield, after Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes were both injured in a training ground collision. The two players are now doubtful for Saturdayâ€™s game against Bournemouth at Old Trafford, according to the UK Mirror. Pogba and Fernandes could also be out of action as United eye a top-four finish and glory in both the Europa League and FA Cup. The accidental clash occurred when Pogba ran into his team-mate during training on Friday at Carrington. Both men were taken away for treatment, with Fernandes appearing to come off worse. Pogba and Fernandes linked up well, as United hammered Brighton 3-0 on Tuesday to extend their unbeaten run to 15 games.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said the decision to overturn Manchester City’s two-year Champions League ban, will not affect his players. The Blues are currently third in the Premier League table and face a battle with Manchester United, Leicester and Wolves for the final top-four place. Lampard however insists the situation is in his players’ hands. He told a press conference on Monday ahead of the Norwich game: “I was pretty neutral on it, I just listened to the verdict this morning. “I genuinely don’t see beyond the games in hand, we have a few games and we want to win them and see if it gets us Champions League football. I was never pinning my hopes on [the verdict]. If we win enough games, we can get in. ‘We’re sitting third, it’s in our hands. I wouldn’t have liked the players to have thought, “oh there’s an extra place, we can relax a little bit.”‘ Chelsea go into the game against Norwich on Tuesday night following a 3-0 defeat against Sheffield United at the weekend.

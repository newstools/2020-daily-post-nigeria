Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has admitted there is a “nervy feeling” after watching his side beat Norwich City 1-0, to strengthen their grip on third place in the Premier League. Olivier Giroud headed in powerfully with the last touch in the first half, to secure maximum points for Lampard’s men. The Blues now need four points from their remaining two fixtures – away to Liverpool, and at home to Wolves on the final day – to be guaranteed of a Champions League place next season. Asked to assess the race to secure a Champions League spot, Lampard told Sky Sports: “It’s a tough one to call. We know our fixtures are hard, but everyone else also has tough games. This is the Premier League and it’s not easy. “We take our three points, we focus on ourselves, we can sit down and watch the other teams this week and focus on our FA Cup semi-final at the weekend [against Manchester United], but there’s obviously still work to do. “There’s a nervy feeling for understandable reasons, so I’m pleased. We went a bit slow for about 10 or 15 minutes in the second half. Then we began moving the ball again and there was a bit of personality in our game today, but we can improve.”

Dr Ahmad Lawan, the Senate President, on Wednesday urged President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure that the 2021 budget is sent to the National Assembly before the end of September this year. Lawan stated this while referring the 2021-2023 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper to the relevant committees of the Senate for necessary legislative action. He noted that the presentation of the budget before the end of September, would enable the National Assembly to complete necessary works and pass it before the end of December. The Senate president also mandated the various committee members to engage all the revenue-generating committees very well to smoothen the passage of the MTEF. DAILY POST recalls that President Buhari had forwarded the 2021-2023 Medium Term Expenditure Framework and Fiscal Strategy Paper to the Senate for approval on Tuesday.

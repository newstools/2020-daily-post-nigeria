Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has urged the Muslim Ummah in the state to reflect deeply on the message of sacrifice which the Eid-El-Kabir signified and use the opportunity to pray for the peace and progress of Abia State and the Nigerian nation. The Governor in a congratulatory message issued in Umuahia, by his Chief Press Secretary, Onyebuchi Ememanka, on Wednesday, to commemorate 2020 Eid-El -Kabir celebration, expressed his appreciation to the Moslem Community in the State for their commitment to peace and good neighborliness. He reassured that his administration is committed to the provision of an enabling environment which will allow adherents of all peaceful faiths to practice their religion. “Even as you celebrate the Sallah holidays, please remember that COVID-19 remains a global challenge. Many of our compatriots get infected on a daily basis as can be seen from statistics from the NCDC.” Ikpeazu, however, wished the Moslem faithful COVID-19 free celebration and further urged them to celebrate responsibly and observe in full, all the protocols as advised by relevant health authorities.

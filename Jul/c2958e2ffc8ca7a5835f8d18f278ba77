Former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, has rubbished the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) account of how Tolulope Arotile died. The late Flying Officer was Nigeria’s first female combat pilot. NAF had stated that she was inadvertently hit by a former classmate when the car was in reverse mode on Air Force base in Kaduna. On Saturday, the former presidential aide dismissed the explanation. He said the death of the highly celebrated young officer was sad and tragic. “She was courageous and formidable in battle, doing much harm to Boko Haram. The idea that she was killed by being knocked down on the Air Force Base by her best friend’s car is nonsensical. “Who is this best friend and what is his/her name? I suspect that Tolu was murdered & the truth is bring covered up. I urge the Chief of Air Staff to investigate this matter thoroughly.” The outspoken government critic said so much is being read into the death and does not augur well for the reputation of the Air Force. Fani-Kayode insisted that justice must be done. He prayed that Tolulope’s soul rest in peace and that the Lord comfort her parents and family. Nigerians and organisations have been calling for a probe of the officer’s death.

Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has declared that “the other party” was provoking him. He made the veil reference about the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday in Benin after the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stakeholders’ meeting. The Edo helmsman condemned the attacks on PDP supporters in front of Oba of Benin palace. Obaseki said his administration would ensure that the perpetrators faced the law. The governor warned that his administration was not weak in responding to political violence. Obaseki noted that being a governor, he would not misuse state powers. “I believe my powers should be used responsibly, particularly in the face of provocation, and especially what the other party did in the palace by attacking our supporters in an attempt to provoke me,” he said. On the governorship race, Obaseki declared: “If we have an election today in the state, PDP will win by 75 per cent. PDP has always won every national election in Edo.” The APC had alleged that Obaseki and Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, were behind the palace incident. APC stated that the destruction of property was a glimpse into the do or die plot the PDP planned to unleash.

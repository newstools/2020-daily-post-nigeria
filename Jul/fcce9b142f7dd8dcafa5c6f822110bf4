Cars 1960 is here to safe millions of Nigerians from buying vehicle from unscrupulous car dealers or auctioneers who will sell to you all in the name of helping you get a good car from Abroad and ended up spending what you never envisage or lose money. 1.TAMPERED ODOMETER. Going by above information you will agree with us that you are not only buying wrong vehicle but also spending more money on car that can’t last you for years. Many cars in Nigeria called “Tokunbo” are not actually what they call them but repackaged or refurbished, when you start driving then you are not only driving a car but a pieces of wood or casket. Researched has told us that 43% of vehicles you buy from car dealers in Nigeria have odometers tampered with, what we are saying here is that most vehicles have about 300,000 (Thirty Thousand Mileage ) (exceeded limit) odometers but as soon as the car comes to Nigeria they will go and reduce it to 30,000 faking it as a real odometers. Do you know that the higher your odometers the higher the risk of buying bad engine, Now stop been deceived by body of the car but pay attention to internal of the car our advise is for you to always get a VIN number(Vehicle Identification Number) of any car you want to buy and send it to us, Even if you are not getting your car through us we will still help you with comprehensive report of the car with less than #4000(Four Thousand Naira Only). 2.DEFLATED AIRBAG.Sometimes we buy car that looks very beautiful outside but we tend to forget that what matters is internal features of the car and not the body, Why should you buy a car that does not have any airbag(s) or the airbag has shifted position? Do you know that 58% of those cars you see between Lagos and Ibadan express way do not have airbags at all? Yes, let us shock you, most cars you also see have their airbag shifted from the position it ought to be. You will all agree with us that airbag works with emergency situation and whenever there is an emergency, airbag will come out but some situations whereby the airbag wanted to come out and don’t, then there is tendency that the airbag is not intact and these kind of cars are what the dealers will buy and sell to you .This article is not to derail any business but to show clearly to Nigerians that you need a car with intact airbag and not to go and use your hand to buy your casket. We just have to wake up from our slumbers and go look for an auctioneer that will help you process the buying of your car and not make away with your money. Please make sure you know their office and sign their papers before dealing and avoid sending money to any individual or company you do not know.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818537" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PHOTO-2020-07-14-13-18-40-1.jpg" alt="" width="813" height="454" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PHOTO-2020-07-14-13-18-40-1.jpg 813w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/PHOTO-2020-07-14-13-18-40-1-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px"> 3.FIXED FLOOD VEHICLES>Nigerians should also be aware here that they don’t have to buy car in the name of body but making sure you get the VIN(Vehicle Identification Number)check done for the car you are buying and it is better you spend less on getting the full history of your car before placing money on it than to ignore report and go and place millions on buying car from the car dealers. the purpose of running a back ground check on a car is to know the true condition of the mileage, history and engine report.40% of cars in Nigeria tend to have flood history and we will advise you should travel abroad or watch CNN (cable news) you will understand what is meant to buy flood vehicle, A flood vehicle is a car that has been affected by SALTY WATER. The good news is that it is very cheap to buy in auction but bad news is that there is no way you will ever enjoy the car because one issues or the other will keep coming up all the time and you will definitely be forced to be friends with either mechanic or rewire. Please do away with any flood car and go as a matter of fact to get the report of a car before buying. We can help you at cars1960. 4.PROGRAMMED ENGINE.

Buying/Auctioning. This is a process of searching for the car of your choice for you, send you two pictures together will be 20 pictures or link to view and we go ahead and bid for it after you have told us your budget, Sign our agreement, Then start bidding and after we have won the bid you will be notified through email notification and you go ahead and pay for the cost of buying only. You will not pay anything until the car get to Nigeria. We will not release the original bill of lading until you pay for the total invoice, at that stage, you can decide to engage your clearing agent if you desire to do so. The reason we decided to give out these offers is to reduce the risk of you paying 100% to the dealers or any auctioneers in Nigeria. Let us help you carry the risk, we have enough fund and resources to handle just 10 clients in every 60 days(GENUINE CLIENTS)We appeal to anyone that want to do business with us to think twice before dealing as we will not entertain anyone with the mindset of coming to defraud or bring us down, Follow the instructions and pay our balance as at when due and that is why you need to read our terms very well and consult your lawyer before dealing as we don’t want it to look as if we lure you to transact with us as we don’t have time for litigation. Our job is to deliver to you as at the time promised and you introduce another person to us and that is our joy and that is what we have been enjoying. Trucking. This is the movement of vehicle from the point of sales at the auction to the shipper or shipping company. In a developed country like United State , they do not allow any auctioned car to be driven on their road. The reason being that if there is any loss or accident and the car do not have an insurance, it will be difficult for the buyer here to get his/her car because there will be nobody to pay back or cover the loss because the car has no insurance, That is why we will engage the help of the trucking company to help us carry the car and load it to the back of their FLAT bed and get it down to the shipping company, usually it is the shipping company that do help us pick up the car and book it for shipping one time. Usually the cost of Trucking depend on the location of the auction, for example it is good to buy car from NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA,HOUSTON TEXAS,SOUTH/NORTH CARLOINA,BALTIMORE,MARYLAND,PHILADEPHIA,VIRGINIA,BOSTON and many more, These cities are closer to the port of loading and it cost less for trucking rather than buying from CALIFORNIA,LOSS ANGELES, CHICAGO, OREGON or any east coast in United State, The cost from these cities for trucking is enough to buy a new auction vehicle and that is why we advised our clients to allow us suggest location and the car they intend to buy for them, Please note that you are seeking our assistance because you already know that we are professionals, so allow us to do our best for you. We need to budget a sum of 550$ for any car from the first nearby pick up rather than paying 1800$ for trucking because of the far location. Please note that we are the one responsible for paying for this trucking as well. Until the car get here, you don’t pay anything. Shipping. Shipping is the movement of cars from United State to the point of delivery (NIGERIA). It is the movement of cars from United State to Nigeria, it cost 1,100$ for shipping and which include delivery of bill of lading to our office in Lagos, irrespective of where the car is coming from in United State that is what the price we will charge you and since we are responsible for this, that is what we will charge you even though some companies will charge you less but that is our price sir/ma,remember you are not paying for this we are responsible for this so we need to be specific. Clearing. This is the situation whereby your car get to Nigeria and you want us to help you clear it or get it out from the port of entry in TINCAN or APAPA.At this point you as a customer need to decide what you want to do with the car that we just brought, You have every power to tell us not to do any clearing, may be because you just get a very smart and sugar coated mouth clearing agent that told you that you will get a Toyota Corolla 2015 cleared for 1 million Naira and you just listen and send money to such agent then we pity your money will go down the drain because even if the car come out of the port, the car will never move outside Lagos as I’m sure the custom will never let it move any longer from that spot .Custom duty is very important and need to be paid if you want our company to help you clear your vehicle as we will never do any short payment, There is bench mark on what the custom charges which is 35% but there is what they call compromised valuation which we will recommend for you while doing the clearance. In a simple sentences, a compromised valuation is a situation where by you pay a reasonable amount as a custom duty instead of short payment, a compromised value is good as far as the valuation emanates from custom department. Do not allow any agent to tell you what is not reasonable as we realized that scammers do have their ways because there are lots of Nigerians that want to buy goods that is too low to be true. Kindly take your time when someone tell you something that is too sweet to be real. We will be responsible for clearing if Customers decided to allow us to do it for them. WATCH OUT FOR SCAMMERS. The money we are using to fund this projects is a loan from our foreign investor and we can’t afford to lose it to people that are not trust worthy, We do not need multitude of clients and we are not competing with anyone but we need people that are responsible and straight forward.

Estuadiantes Chairman, Juan Sebastian Veron, has told Lionel Messi that the No 10 shirt will be his if he decides to join Barcelona. Veron, however, admits he does not see his compatriot leaving the Nou Camp. There have been speculations linking Messi with a move away from Barca, with his current deal set to end in 2021. Messi has been linked with an exit several times but has always ended up reaching an agreement with the Spanish giants. Veron says a role could be found for the 33-year-old if he decides to head home. He told Fox Sports: “If you want to come here [Estudiantes], you have the ’10’ ensured. “Beyond that, I don’t really imagine him outside Barcelona, but these are things that we say today and tomorrow we see him out there going to another club. “The reality is that he is the only one who has the decision and desire; no one else knows.”

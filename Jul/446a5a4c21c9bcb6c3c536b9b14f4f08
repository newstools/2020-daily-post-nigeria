The Federal Government has lifted the ban placed on the private airline, Executive Jet Services, which flew musician, Azeez Fashola aka Naira Marley, to Abuja to attend a concert in June. DAILY POST had reported that the Federal Government had suspended the flight that conveyed the singer to Abuja for a concert. It said that the airline had acted in contravention of the restriction on interstate movement and closure of airports in existence at the time. However, the Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, on Monday during a presidential Task Force briefing on COVID-19 in Abuja, said the ban has been lifted. According to Sirika, the Airline has complied substantially with all the sanctions imposed on them. He said “Today, we lifted the ban on Executive Air Services Limited. ”They have complied substantially with all of our imposed sanctions; they’ve paid part of the fines, and they brought up premium plan. ”So, we have lifted the ban today, so, they continue to do their business. “These sanctions are not punitive, they are things to make our industry work better and keep all of you safe.” The minister added that the report on the Very Important Personalities being probed for flouting Covid-19 protocol at the country’s airports would be made public “hopefully this week”.

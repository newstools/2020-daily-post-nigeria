The Nigerian Army has said it is not their duty to expose those sponsoring Boko Haram in the country. Coordinator of Defence Media Operations, John Enenche, stated this at a media briefing on Thursday. Enenche admitted that the Army knows that some criminal groups have heavy financial backing, but its major task is to fight “terrorism and other criminality”. He explained that the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and the Department of State Services (DSS) were responsible for revealing the sponsors. “It is not the duty of the military to uncover the sponsors. “Our duty is to remain in the frontline and defeat terrorism and other criminality and that is what we are doing. “We have the National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and the Department of State Security (DSS). It is their responsibility to gather intelligence on the sponsors of the terrorists and not the military,” Enenche maintained.

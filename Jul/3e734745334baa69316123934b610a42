The United States of America has expressed grief over the death of Tolulope Arotile. Tolu, 24, was Nigeria’s first female combat pilot. On Monday, the U.S Mission in Nigeria commiserated with the family. “We hope her inspiring story, perseverance, and patriotism comfort all those who supported her dream of becoming Nigeria’s first female combat helicopter pilot”, the tweet read. The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) explained that Tolu was killed by a reversing car driven by her former classmate. The explanation sparked outrage with Nigerians calling for a thorough probe. Some, including former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, suggest the late Flying Officer’s demise might be a premeditated murder. On Sunday, NAF revealed the identity of the alleged killer and others in the said vehicle.

A report by the Presidential Probe Panel has revealed how Ibrahim Magu, the suspended acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), allegedly failed to cooperate with authorities in the United Kingdom (UK) to facilitate effective prosecution of the case of ex-Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke. NAN reports that Magu was on Saturday night interrogated by the panel headed by retired Justice Ayo Salami over allegations of lack of transparency in managing recovered assets and mismanagement by the commission. The Presidential Committee on Audit of Recovered Assets (PCARA) Report accused Magu of failure to cooperate with the UK authorities to facilitate effective prosecution of Alison-Madueke’s case. PCARA also accused Magu of deliberately refusing to provide documentary evidence that would make the office of the nation’s Attorney-General to commence the extradition process of Alison-Madueke. “In the Diezani Alison Madueke case, the Acting Chairman is failing to further cooperate with the UK NCA to enable them to charge the Former Minister to court in the UK. “The Acting Chairman despite his knowledge that Mrs Madueke will not be extradited to Nigeria until after her trial in the UK, has consistently been accusing the UK government on the pages of print and electronic media of not wanting to extradite her to Nigeria,” the report maintained. “This has strained the EFCC relationship with Europe’s most strategic partner,” the report further observed. Magu, who is being held at the Police headquarters, Abuja, is expected to reappear before the Salami probe panel on Monday, to defend himself against several other allegations.

The Federal High Court, Abuja on Wednesday, refused to admit Bala Hamisu, popularly known as Wadume to bail. The court refused Hamisu bail along with six others standing trial for kidnapping, possession of firearms, and dealing in illegal firearms, contrary to Section 27 (1)(a)(I) and (1)(b)(iii) of the Firearms Act, NAN reports. The Justice Binta Nyako rejected the defendantâ€™s bail application on the grounds that she had already ordered an accelerated hearing on the matter. The Justice also ordered that the defendants should be moved from the Special Anti-Robbery Squad, SARS, unit of the police to the Kuje Correctional Centre. Nyako ordered the authorities of the Correctional Center to allow the defendants to have access to medical facilities as well as their lawyers. Recall that the Federal Government on June 8, arraigned Wadume and six other on a 13-count charge, bordering on terrorism. On June 3, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, took over the matter from the police.

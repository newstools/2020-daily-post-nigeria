Real Madrid are one win away from winning their 34th LaLiga title, after a battling 2-1 victory over Granada on Monday. Los Blancos took an early lead through Ferland Mendy, who finished off a solo run with a goal in the 10th minute. It was 2-0 minutes later, after Karim Benzema curled an exquisite strike past Rui Silva. Granada halved the deficit at the start of the second half through Darwin Machis. However, Real held on for three crucial points, with Sergio Ramos sweeping a goalbound effort off the line late on. The victory restored their four-point lead over Barcelona in the table with just two games left to play. A home win for Real against Villarreal on Thursday can put the title out of reach.

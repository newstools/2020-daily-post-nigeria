The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Friday, reacted to the inauguration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) campaign team led by the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje. PDP claimed that APC appointed Ganduje, Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State and Yahaya Bello of Kogi State to rig the upcoming governorship election in Edo State. Nigeria’s electoral umpire had scheduled the Edo State governorship election for September 19, 2020. However, APC had appointed Ganduje to head a 49-man campaign team for the Edo gubernatorial election. Reacting to the list, PDP’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan had faulted the decision of the party to appoint Ganduje, Uzodinma and Bello as head of its campaign team. A statement by Ologbondiyan said the trio were selected by the APC so as to “force a combined formula of Kano and Kogi electoral violence as well as Imo state mandate robbery to subvert the will of the people of Edo State in the governorship election.” Ologbondiyan said it was pathetic that the “APC only has a person who has become a butt of international shame after being seen in a viral video stuffing his robe with gratification, in foreign currency, to serve as Chairman of its Edo state governorship campaign council. “It is equally contemptuous that such a person is being deputized by another individual, who has become a metaphor of electoral manipulation, after being so docketed by a judgment of the Supreme Court. “It is also disgusting that a governor who deployed a Police helicopter to scare voters on election day has been mandated to deploy thugs and dangerous weapons through the northern borderlines of Edo State ahead of the election. “Part of APC’s plot is to import election mercenaries as observers to attempt to scare the people of Edo state, suppress them and steal their mandate.”

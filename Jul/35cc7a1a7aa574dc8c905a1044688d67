The immediate past Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has attacked former President Olusegun Obasanjo over corruption allegations and insecurity under the President Muhammadu Buhari government. Fayose said that Obasanjo’s silence despite allegations and counter-allegations of corruption from different Ministries and agencies and killings in various parts of the country was worrisome. He noted that Obasanjo fought against his successor, Goodluck Jonathan and forced Buhari on Nigerians because of corruption and insecurity. According to the former Governor, it is either Obasanjo is now tired, timid, afraid or he is no longer who he used to be. “With the level of corruption and insecurity that we are seeing in Nigeria under this APC govt, former President Obasanjo is curiously silent,” he tweeted on Saturday afternoon. “And it was because of alleged corruption and insecurity that Obasanjo teamed up with others to foist Buhari on Nigeria. “Isn’t Obasanjo’s silence worrisome? It is either Baba is tired, timid, afraid or he is no longer the Obasanjo that we used to know. “Will he keep silent while the entire country is being looted away and Nigerians anywhere in the country can’t sleep with their two eyes closed?”

Brazilian President, Jair Bolsonaro has again been tested for coronavirus. He initially described his illness as a ‘little flu’ after he showed fever symptoms. Dpa reports that Bolsonaro, 65, was tested at the military hospital in the capital Brasilia. The President had been seen severally in public without a face mask. Bolsonaro was earlier tested three times for the virus. A lawsuit by the state of Sao Paulo forced the government to release the results in May. The results presented to the Supreme Court were negative at the time. Brazil has recorded more than 1.6 million cases of coronavirus and 65,000 deaths.

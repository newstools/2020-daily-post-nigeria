The traditional rulers of Anambra Central Senatorial District have disagreed with their colleagues in the Southern senatorial zone over the zoning formula for the governorship position in the state. The traditional rulers in a meeting held on Thursday at the palace of the Igwe of Ukwulu community, Igwe Peter Uyanwa, rejected zoning of the governorship position to the south while condemning the call by their southern colleagues for other aspirants from other zones to back down. The monarchs said the quality of a governor is more important to the state than where he hails from. A short statement released after the meeting stated that; “At the meeting of the Anambra Central Traditional Rulers Forum held on 2nd July 2020, it was unanimously resolved that we dissociate ourselves from any zoning arrangement in Anambra State gubernatorial election. “That we in the Central Forum will only accept and encourage any credible candidate governorship candidate that is ready, willing and capable of delivering the dividend of democracy to Ndi Anambra.” Monarchs of the northern zone of the state had earlier dissociated themselves too from zoning, saying that they seek the best candidate for the state.

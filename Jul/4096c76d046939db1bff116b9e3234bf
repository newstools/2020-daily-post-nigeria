Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) has provided the latest update on forward Kylian Mbappe’s injury. Mbappe suffered an ankle sprain in Friday’s French Cup final win over St Etienne. A rough tackle from Loic Perrin saw the St Etienne defender catch Mbappe on the ankle, and the France World Cup winner collapsed on the pitch in pain before he was substituted. Perrin was sent off by the referee for the challenge as PSG won 1-0. PSG, in a statement via its official website on Saturday, confirmed that the 21-year-old sustained an ankle sprain injury and will be reassessed in three days’ time. “Serious right ankle sprain to the external lateral compartment. To be re-evaluated in 72 hours with clinical and ankle imaging analysis,” the club said of Mbappe’s injury in a statement. Mbappe returned to the bench on crutches after half-time. He later told French President Emmanuel Macron during the trophy ceremony that he heard a crack when he was tackled but did not think he had broken his ankle. Ligue 1 champions PSG did not say if Mbappe will feature in Friday’s French League Cup final against Olympique Lyonnais. The Parisians are chasing a quadruple of titles this season. They also face Italian side, Atalanta in a UEFA Champions League quarter-final knockout game in Lisbon on August 12.

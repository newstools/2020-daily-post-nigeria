The Edo State government has insisted that it has not authorised the reopening of schools in the state for the third term academic activities. The state Commissioner for Education, Mr. Jimoh Ijegbai, made this known in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Friday in Benin. Ijegbai said no school in the State has been authorised to reopen, whether public or private, including certificate classes. He warned that schools who flout this directive would be sanctioned. He said: “It has come to the attention of the Edo State Government that some schools in the state have reopened and some are planning to reopen for the third term academic session. “For the avoidance of doubt, the state government has not authorised schools whether public or private, even the certificate classes to reopen under the present circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic.” He added that date of resumption will be communicated to all stakeholders after modalities have been put in place at the appropriate time. The commissioner advised school principals in the state to be guided by the state government’s directive on this.

Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes on Friday was rewarded for his outstanding performance for the club as he was named the Premier League’s player of the month for the second time in a row. Fernandes had won the prize for June as well. In doing so, the 25-year-old has now equalled compatriot Cristiano Ronaldo, who had achieved the same feat in 2006 during his time at Man United. This is coming after Fernandes scored a goal to inspire Man United to beat Aston Villa 3-0 in the Premier League on Thursday night. Fernandes joined the Red Devils from Sporting Lisbon last January transfer window. The Portuguese international has scored seven goals and provided six assists in ten Premier League matches for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side. Fernandes will now hope to lead United to victory when they take on Southampton in their next fixture on Monday.

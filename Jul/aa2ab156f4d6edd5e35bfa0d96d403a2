The Federal Government has released guidelines ahead of the planned resumption of schools, at every level in the country. However, no dates have been given for the reopening. The guidelines detailed measures and requirements needed for the safe reopening of schools after the COVID-19 pandemic. It was released by the Federal Ministry of Education in Abuja on Monday and signed by the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu and Minister of State (Education), Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba. The guidelines were developed in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Environment, Federal Ministry of Health and health safety experts in Nigeria. The document reads, “However, there are exceptions where the two-meter rule cannot be reasonably applied and other risk mitigation strategies may be adopted. Examples include early years, younger primary school children, and those with additional needs. “In these circumstances, risk assessments must be undertaken with the best interests of the learners, teachers, and other education personnel in mind. The scenarios require organizing learners and children into small groups with consistent membership and compliance with the risk mitigation strategies. The membership of these groups should not change unless the NCDC public health guideline suggests otherwise.

A former Arsenal player, Charlie Nicholas, has predicted Manchester United to play a 1-1 with Leicester City at the King Power Stadium on the final day of the Premier League season on Sunday. He also backed Chelsea and Wolves to play a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge. Providing his predictions, Nicholas told Sky Sports: “I look at Leicester and to be fair to them, they probably deserve the top four for what they have done this season – but of course, you do not do it in the early part of the season, you do it now. “They do look stretched, really stretched. Everything is geared towards looking at Jamie Vardy. They are missing James Maddison. “United have that cushion, so Leicester have to go for the win, which does not change a lot for Brendan Rodgers, but they will want to keep it tight for the first half-hour and then see how the land lies. “Manchester United know how to get a result from a game like this, though. I think it will be tense and dramatic, but I think they will get there, they will get a draw, 1-1.” On the Chelsea vs Wolves game, Nicholas added: “I think Chelsea will get a draw, but they will have to sweat. “Wolves are well-drilled at the back, but Chelsea going forward, I think they will be able to score 2-2.” The match kick-off time for Chelsea vs Wolves and Leicester City vs Man United is 3 pm.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has said the disinfection of schools against COVID-19 will begin on Tuesday, in preparation for the resumption of academic activities. Minister of Environment, Muhammad Mahmood, revealed this on Monday while speaking at the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. He explained that the delay in the decontamination process was there they would be enough teams on the ground to carry out the exercise. “The delay is because it is better to disinfect and decontaminate within a short period of time so that the kids will be going back into these classes when they have been freshly decontaminated. “This is because the chemicals we use are chemicals that are not long-lasting; they have short contact time to do their job. So we will be getting this done before Monday when they (schoolchildren) will be back to use these classes,” Mahmmood said. The Lagos State government state, for instance, has announced reopening schools for students in ‘transitional classes’. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu had instructed students in Basic Six, JSS 3 and SS3 to resume on August 3, 2020.

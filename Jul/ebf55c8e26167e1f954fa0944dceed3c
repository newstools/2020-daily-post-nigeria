Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, has announced that he has received a major support ahead of the governorship election. Akeredolu made the announcement on Twitter. On Monday, he said Segun Abraham, one of the All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirants, had endorsed him. “I just got off the phone with my brother Olusegun Abraham who informed me of his decision to support my second term ambition. Together, we will keep the sun shining in Ondo State”, he tweeted. The poll will hold on October 10. No fewer than 2,500 delegates will elect the party’s flagbearer.

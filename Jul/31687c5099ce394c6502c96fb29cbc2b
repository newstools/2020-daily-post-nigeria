Former Military Head of State, Gen Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida, IBB, has reacted to the death of Malam Isa Funtua. IBB said Nigerians largely misunderstood Funtua, a close associate of President Muhammadu Buhari. In a tribute he signed, the former Head of State said the deceased was frank in nature and never pretended regarding issues. Funtua died on Monday night in Abuja and was buried on Tuesday. Reacting, IBB said: “It has taken me two days of shock to be able to muscle the strength to write this tribute and condolence to the family of my departed brother, friend, associate and confidant, Ismaila Isa Funtua. “Malam Isa, as I fondly call him, was one Nigerian who never pretended about issues and situations. You would rightly know where he belongs. He was not given to frivolities and shenanigans. “He was pointedly frank when he needed to make his position known on any matter. He was indeed a bridge builder, a peacemaker and one who believed so much in the unity of Nigeria. ‘He was a pan-Nigeria statesman who was largely misunderstood by some and eternally appreciated by many who understood the dynamics of his engagements.”

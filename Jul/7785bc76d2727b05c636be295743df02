Mala Mai Buni, Chairman, All Progressives Congress (APC) Caretaker Committee, has declared that the party will win Edo and Ondo governorship polls. He premised his optimism on the ongoing reconciliation efforts by leadership of the party. The Yobe governor spoke on Monday at the APC National Secretariat in Abuja. He inaugurated the Edo Governorship Campaign Council and the Reconciliation Committee for Edo/Ondo States. Buni expressed confidence that the teams would deliver the states to the party. He said the assignment before the reconciliation and campaign council was to build a united APC and to ensure “successful renewal” of Edo mandate. The governor urged the council to reach out to all stakeholders and pursue its assignment with all sense of purpose and commitment. Buni appealed to all APC members of the party across the country to support the peace initiative. “I am glad to state that the caretaker committee which I am opportune to lead had initiated wide range of consultations and reconciliatory measures to pave the way for true and sincere reconciliations.” He called for all-inclusive consultations “to accommodate and fix-up areas posing threats to the party.” The chairman added that the visit to some founding members of the party last week has justified the new approach with very positive results.

It would be recalled that the House recently resolved to investigate the circumstances behind the sacking of the Managing Director/Chief Executive of the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF), Adebayo Somefun. Recalled that during the debate on the motion, the Chairman of House Committee on Finance made some accusations against Ngige, hence the House resolved to summon the Minister.

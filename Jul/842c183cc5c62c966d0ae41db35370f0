Manchester United will set a new Premier League record if they win by more than three goals at Aston Villa on Thursday night. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side is in the middle of a 16-game unbeaten run in all competitions. United are in form having won 10 points from a possible 12 since the Premier League’s resumption. Since drawing with Tottenham in June, the Red Devils have seen off Sheffield United, Brighton and Bournemouth. And should they win by three or more goals at Villa Park today, they will set a Premier League record for consecutive wins by at least three goals. Sheffield United and Brighton were cast aside 3-0 before they beat Bournemouth 5-2. United are on a 20-match unbeaten streak at Villa Park.

Chelsea have decided not to activate a buyback clause in order to sign Nathan Ake from Bournemouth, because manager Frank Lampard does not view the Dutch defender as an upgrade on the club’s centre-backs, according to The Athletic. Ake is set to sign for Manchester City after a £41million bid was accepted on Thursday. https://dailypost.ng/2020/07/30/epl-man-city-agree-e43m-deal-for-nathan-ake/ The 25-year-old joined Bournemouth in 2017 in a £20m deal from Chelsea. The Blues inserted a £40m buyback clause in his contract, which meant they could re-sign the defender for twice what they sold him for. The clause effectively gives Chelsea first refusal on Ake and the club have a short window – believed to be 72 hours – in which they can activate the clause after Bournemouth notified the Blues of their accepted bid. However, there is no chance of Chelsea matching the bid, as Lampard only wants to recruit a top level centre-back this summer.

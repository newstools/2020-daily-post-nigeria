Niger State Governor, Abubakar Bello, has directed that the salaries and allowances of all political appointees in the state be slashed by 30 percent. This was confirmed in a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government, Ahmed Matane, on Tuesday. Matane noted the reduction takes effect immediately. The cut affects the governor, the deputy governor, commissioners, special advisers and every other political appointees. “The reduction, which is temporary, was also in consideration of the economic situation imposed on the state by the coronavirus pandemic,” the statement read in part. Matane added that payment of full salaries and allowances would resume when the economy improves. While regretting any inconvenience, the officers affected may encounter as a result of the reduction, he “acknowledged the patriotism, patience, and cooperation of all the political appointees at all times.”

The Nigerian Communications Commission, NCC, has revealed steps Nigerians can take in order to enjoy the privileges provided by the Freedom Of Information Act, FOIA. Recall that the FOI Act was passed by the National Assembly in May 2011 and signed into law by the then President, Goodluck Jonathan the same month. The FOI is an Act that gives an individual, group, association or organization the right to access information from government agencies, parastatals, federal civil service, private and public sector organizations providing public services, etc. In its effort to ensure that Nigerians enjoy all the privileges attached to the Act, NCC has given the following clarifications: Who can make a request under the FOIA Any person, group, association, organization, etc. can make a request for information under the FOIA. The request must be in writing with a clear description of the information being sought, and in compliance with specific institutional requirements. How an FOIA request made To get information under the FOIA, a request must be made either electronically (e.g. email) or by letter in written form, describing the information sought for, and the preferred format of the response, in as much detail as possible.

Tragedy struck again in Kogi State following the killing of 14 persons in Agudu, Bassa community in Kogi Local Government Area by unknown gunmen. It was reliably gathered that the incident happened at about 2:30 am on Wednesday as many residents injured have since been receiving treatment at the hospital. Sources told DAILY POST that 13 of the deceased victims came from one family. Speaking to DAILY POST, Hon Isah Abdulkareem, Senior Special Assistant on Security, Kogi LGA said the situation in the area has been brought to normal. ” I got a call from Bassa Youth forum at about 2:30 am of the attack. I mobilized the security agencies who brought the situation to normal. “This attack is unfortunate. I can’t point out the perpetrators of this act. I don’t know whether they are herdsmen or bandits. The only thing I noticed was that only a particular family in the community, except for one man who ran into the scene, were killed in the incident,” he noted. The Kogi Commissioner of Police, Ayuba Ede confirmed the incident while briefing journalists on Wednesday afternoon. Ede attributed the killings to a long communal clash between some rival communities, assuring that, those behind the act will face the full wrath of the law. Meanwhile, the Kogi State Police Command has paraded 28 suspected armed robbers, kidnappers, terrorizing the peace of the state. DAILY POST gathered that some of the suspects paraded were linked to those who killed Kogi business mogul, Theophilus Ofodile popularly known as Chuks. Chuks was killed sometime last month along Lokoja/Abuja road by heavily armed robbers in his car. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-822492 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_20200729_131308_6-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="555" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_20200729_131308_6-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_20200729_131308_6-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_20200729_131308_6-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_20200729_131308_6-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

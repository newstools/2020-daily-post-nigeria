Four Big Brother Naija 2020 housemates, on Saturday night, shared kisses in the ‘Lockdown’ reality show. It all started during a truth or dare game which occurred after the Saturday night party. Praise had dared Wathoni to kiss any guy in the house. However, Wathoni who was confused on who to pick, asked the Head of House, Nengi, to choose a suitable guy between Kiddwaya and Praise. After Nengi picked Kiddwaya, Wathoni kissed him for 20 seconds. Also, Eric and Lilo who have been spotted together severally, had some sort of physical contact after the party. The duo were subtly cuddled up on the same bed and kissing after the party. These can be dubbed as the first official kisses in the BBNaija Lockdown house.

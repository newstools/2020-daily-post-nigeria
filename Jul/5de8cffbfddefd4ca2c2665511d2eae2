The Federal Government (FG) has said that it was not yet safe for academic activities to resume in schools across the country. The Minister of state for education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, said this while addressing journalists at the end of the eighth virtual federal executive council meeting, on Wednesday. Nwajiuba also disclosed that WAEC is negotiating with other West African countries to look at possible shifts in date for the 2020 WASSCE. The FG had ordered the closure of schools since March to curtail the spread of coronavirus. Despite demand by the House of Representatives for the reopening of schools to allow students to write the 2020 West African Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), Nwajiuba said academic institutions would remain closed till adequate safety is assured. He said after a review, the ministry discovered that it would be risky for schools to partially resume amid the rising number of coronavirus cases. “We are still meeting with parents over that, we are not confident, yet that everywhere is safe, the number of COVID-19 infections from the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is still very alarming, and we have presented this to parents and all stakeholders in the education ecosystem,” Nwajiuba said. “We are still meeting with them; in fact, there is a stakeholder meeting slated for Monday next week. “WAEC on its own part is also negotiating with other West African countries to look at possible shifts in date, and once they are through with that meeting and hopefully when we are also through with the consultations if there is any change in the ministry’s position, we will communicate,” he said. Meanwhile, Nigeria has recorded 33,616 cases of COVID-19, with 13,792 recoveries and 754 deaths as of Tuesday night, according to the NCDC.

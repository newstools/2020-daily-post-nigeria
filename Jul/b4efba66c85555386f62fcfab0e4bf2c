Former Arsenal forward, Charlie Nicholas and former Liverpool defender, Mark Lawrenson, have predicted the winner of tonight’s Premier League clash between Tottenham Hotspur and Everton. Tottenham was defeated 3-1 against Sheffield United in their last Premier League clash on Thursday, while Everton won Leicester City 2-1 on Wednesday. Writing in his column for Sky Sports, Nicholas said: “Mourinho looks a lonely figure, and I do not see Tottenham winning here either. “Everton improved massively, and I see them nicking a point here in a score draw.” Also, providing his prediction, Lawrenson wrote in his column for BBC Sport: “The Toffees are going to be an interesting team next season because they have got money and they’ll back Ancelotti in the transfer market. They’ll be targeting the top six, for starters. “So will Tottenham. After what happened to them against Sheffield United on Thursday, I would expect a reaction from Jose Mourinho’s side. “It will be a good battle, but I am going for a Spurs win.” The match is scheduled at 8 pm.

The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has declared that coronavirus cases in Nigeria will increase. Secretary to the Government (PTF) of the Federation and Chairman of the PTF, Boss Mustapha, said this at a media briefing on Thursday. According to Mustapha, the ease in restrictions would jerk up infections. Mustapha appealed to Nigerians not to assume that the relaxation meant that the battle against COVID-19 was over. “One significant observation the PTF wishes to make is that new rises in cases are to be expected as nations start to ease restrictions. We shall, however, proceed with caution and we shall not hesitate to change course when the need arises” What this means, he explained, was that “Nigerians should never mistake the relaxation by the government as a signal that the COVID-19 battle had been concluded.”

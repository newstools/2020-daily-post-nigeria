Former England striker, Michael Owen and former Arsenal forward, Charlie Nicholas, have predicted tonight’s Premier League clash between Aston Villa and Manchester United at Villa Park. Man United head to the game after beating Bournemouth 5-2 in their previous match, while Aston Villa lost 2-0 against Premier League champions, Liverpool. Providing his prediction, Owen wrote in his column for BetVictor: “Aston Villa actually played well at Anfield against Liverpool on Sunday but came away with nothing for their efforts. “They are now without a win in 10 games, and things do not get any easier as far as their fixtures are concerned. “Manchester United have won eleven of the last 13 Premier League meetings between these two sides, and I cannot see beyond another stroll in the park for the Red Devils.” On his part, Nicholas wrote in his column for Sky Sports: “I have said that the one team who have not faltered has been Man United. “They should have won at Tottenham, but their restart has been full of pace, power, excellent finishing – Anthony Martial now has 15 goals in the Premier League. “Aston Villa is due a break, I think. They played well against Liverpool at Anfield and should have gone ahead on a couple of occasions but didn’t take their chances, and couldn’t make the most of their counter-attacks. “They rely on Jack Grealish, who is by far their most talented player. “I do think they’re due something, and it might be this one where they get something back from it. “I don’t know how I’m coming up with 2 goals for Aston Villa. “I have a feeling they may get something from this one, Aston Villa 2, Man Utd 2.” The game is scheduled at 8:15 pm.

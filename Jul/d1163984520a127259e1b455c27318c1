Delta State House of Assembly has assured Governor Ifeanyi Okowa and his family of prayers for their speedy recovery. The governor, his wife, Edith and daughter, tested positive to coronavirus in one week. The Speaker, Sheriff Oborevwori, told newsmen on Thursday in Asaba, that the House leadership and members identified with the Okowas at this time. He commended the governor for the courage in disclosing the status of the family. Oborevwori hailed “the strength of character, integrity and honour of the governor in embracing the full disclosure option”. The lawmaker prayed that “God would allow His divine healing hand rest upon the first family of the state”. He assured Okowa and family that the Assembly would also continue to pray for the “quick recovery of the governor’s wife and daughter, as well as all others, who had contracted the virus”. Oborevwori appealed to Deltans to fully comply with preventive measures announced by the Nigeria Centre For Disease Control (NCDC). Okowa announced he tested positive for coronavirus, a day after Ondo Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, confirmed that he had contracted the virus.

Former representative of Rivers South-East Senatorial District at the National Assembly, Magnus Abe, has urged politicians to play politics of progress and prosperity and not wish others death. He made the call in a statement on Monday by his spokesperson, Parry Benson. Abe said it was unfortunate that his opponents announced his physical and political death and burial. The ex-lawmaker condemned such negative mindsets, describing it as undemocratic and evil. He described as shameful, how some people “conceive and imagine these negative thoughts”. “Everyday you bury Senator Abe in the morning, by evening you are shouting about the same man you buried in the morning and then you bury him again and again,” he said. Abe recalled that some politicians of Ogoni descent and their cohorts two years ago, carried out a funeral procession with his name on a coffin in Bori furtherance of their politics of hatred and bitterness. “It got to the point where a coffin with Senator Abe was carried on live television in Bori and buried, yet Senator Abe is still here. The purpose of our politics should not be the burial of anyone. It should be about the progress and prosperity of our nation. “I represent the truth, the truth does not die and so it can never be buried. Real people cannot bury the truth, hirelings, with real names or pseudo names cannot bury the truth. Change is always a painful process. But change must come,” he admonished.

Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar has reacted to the exoneration of the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwumi Adesina, by an Independent Review Panel set up to investigate him. DAILY POST had reported that the panel was set up by AFDB Bureau of Governors, following a complaint by the United States. The panel found out that the allegations against Adesina were properly considered and dismissed by the Committee. The panel said it “considered the President’s submissions on their face and finds them consistent with his innocence and to be persuasive.” Reacting, Atiku said the exoneration means that a lie has no legs. He tweeted, ”The exoneration of @akin_adesina of allegations of fraud by an independent @AfDB_Group review panel confirms the saying that a lie has no legs.”

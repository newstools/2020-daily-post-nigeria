Napoli star, Dries Mertens, has promised to help Nigerian striker, Victor Osimhen to settle at the club next season once he officially joins the Serie A club this summer. Mertens said this ahead of Napoli’s Serie A clash against Lazio on Saturday night. DAILY POST recalls that Napoli are favourite to sign Osimhen from Lille this summer transfer window after the Nigerian international visited Italy some weeks ago to hold talks with Gennaro Gattuso’s side over a possible move. Osimhen, who enjoyed a dazzling debut season at Lille, has also been linked with several big clubs in England, Spain and Italy, but he could now be set to join the Naples outfit. “I want to help the team and the young people, that’s my future. I want to help Osimhen and Petagna, we can play together,” Mertens told Radio Kiss Kiss Napoli. “It’s difficult to come from another country and settle in, we must help them fit in here.” He added: “On Saturday we have an important match against Lazio, and we must be confident and ready. “Anything can happen. It was strange when we first played behind closed doors against Inter, you could hear everything. I’m used to it by now.”

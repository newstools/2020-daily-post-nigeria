The Nigeria Police Force has warned intending applicants to beware of scammers who may want to dupe them during its recently announced recruitment exercise. Police, in an update on its verified Facebook page, said the recruitment exercise is absolutely free, charging applicants to beware of fake recruitment sites. DAILY POST reports that the recruitment portal was finally opened to applicants who may want to join the Police on Tuesday. The recruitment is for applicants who must have obtained five credits in WASSCE, NECO, NABTEB and GCE, and between the age of 17 and 25. As the portal became accessible, it was observed that applicants are mandated to create an account with their National Identification Number (NIN). Police said the application required the NIN, as those who have not been captured by the NIMC will not be able to access the recruitment portal. According to information displayed on the portal, police said, by providing the NIN, an applicant has given the “NPF the right to get his/her biodata i.e. Basic information from NIMC and the data will not be editable after creating the account.”

Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said their LaLiga title win this year, tastes sweeter than any of the three Champions League crowns he has won. Los Blancos clinched their 34th league title with a 2-1 victory over Villarreal on Thursday. Zidane’s men have won all 10 fixtures since the league resumed following a COVID-19 lockdown. “The Champions League is the Champions League but La Liga makes me happier, because La Liga is what it’s all about. “This is a tremendous feeling because what these players have done is incredible. I am lost for words because I am too emotional,” the Frenchman told MOvistar. Zidane has now won 11 trophies as Real Madrid manager, but this is only his second league title.

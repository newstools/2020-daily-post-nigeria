Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has refused to be drawn into his plans for the transfer market this summer. However, the Spaniard feels Lionel Messi should remain at Barcelona next season. Guardiola worked with Messi during his four-year spell at Barca, during which they won two Champions League and three LaLiga titles. However, with Messi being linked with a move away, Guardiola feels the Argentine superstar should end his career at the Camp Nou. “As I’ve said before, we’ll talk about the transfer market at the end of the season and I won’t say anything now. “But my preference is for Messi to stay at Barcelona,” Guardiola told a virtual press conference on Tuesday.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has already got a ‘clear plan’ that will make the club sell midfielder, Jorginho this summer’s transfer window. This claim was made by former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville. Jorginho only made his first appearance for Chelsea since the Premier League restart in their 3-2 win against Crystal Palace on Tuesday night. The 28-year-old, who was signed by current Juventus coach, Maurizio Sarri, made a brief cameo at the end of their win at Palace. But Neville believes Lampard is ready to sell the Italy international this summer. “You have to think that he [Jorginho] is being managed out of Stamford Bridge,” Neville told Sky Sports. “I think it has been clear from the moment Frank Lampard came in that he wants to build a young and hungry squad. “Look at the way David Luiz was let go. “With the way Jorginho has been dealt with, it is quite clear where Lampard wants to take the team. “When you think of Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp over the last few years, they do not veer away from the plan for any player. “Frank Lampard has got a clear plan.”

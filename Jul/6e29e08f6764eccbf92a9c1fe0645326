A Kwara State high court sitting in Ilorin on Thursday, convicted a 25-year-old internet fraud suspect, Salawu Victor. The presiding judge, Justice Sikiru Oyinloye, who convicted the suspect, ordered him “to sweep and clear the popular Ahmadu Bello Way to the state Commissioner of Police quarters in GRA, Ilorin the state capital.” Justice Oyinloye also ordered the convict to pay a fine of N50,000. The judge further ordered that “the two phones recovered from the defendant be forfeited to the Federal government with a right to re-purchase them.” The Ilorin Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, in a charge sheet brought against the convict in court, stated “that Salawu Victor, sometime in the month of February 2019, in Ilorin, within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, did attempt to cheat by impersonation by portraying yourself as a “white male named James Chris” via your email address, jameschris 231411@gmail.com to one Seth B to induce him to send you money, a representation you knew to be false and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 95 of the Penal code and punishable under Section 324 of the same law.” At the resumed hearing of the matter on Thursday, the prosecuting counsel, Andrew Akoja, informed the court “My Lord, before this honourable court is a one-count charge dated June 2020, we pray the court to accept the charge and allow it to be read to the defendant.” Salawu Victor thereafter pleaded guilty to the charge. Delivering judgement, Justice Oyinloye said, “the defendant in his statement to the commission did not deny the allegation levelled against him. “He Salawu also did not offer any explanation to discredit the charge. “It is the opinion of this honourable court that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and you “Salawu Victor” is hereby convicted as charged,” Justice Oyinloye declared.

The Adamawa State Government has imposed a dusk to dawn curfew on the entire Guyuk Local Government Area following renewed violence there. Also affected by the curfew is Lafiya town in Lamurde Local Government Area, according to a statement released on Thursday by the Press Secretary to Governor Umaru Fintiri, Mr. Humwashi Wonosikou. The curfew followed the violence that erupted in some communities and the attendant tension, the statement explained. It said Governor Ahmadu Fintiri who is saddened by the breach of peace in the areas had approved the imposition of a curfew from 6:00pm to 6:00am with immediate effect. The statement quoted the governor as saying, “I’m worried that the warring communities have refused to sheath their swords despite the government’s peace-building initiative.” It said the governor warned those sponsoring violence to have a rethink and allow peace to reign in the areas. “Government requires residents to abide by this directive until further notice, to restore normalcy to the areas,” the statement said. It added that security agencies had been directed to enforce the curfew, and urged residents of Guyuk Local Government and Lafiya community in Lamurde Local Government area to shun rumour-mongering and provide relevant information to security agencies to ensure peace. Scores of residents died and an even higher number of homes were destroyed last month when communal clashes occurred in communities around both Lamurde and Guyuk LGAs, throwing hundreds of people into hurriedly established camps. Most of the internally displaced people were still in such camps as the latest clashes occurred, although details of the latest conflicts were yet to be ascertained by press time Thursday night.

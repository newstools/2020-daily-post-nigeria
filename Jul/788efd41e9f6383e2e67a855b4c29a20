The management of University of Lagos (UNILAG) has reacted to the threat to the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of Council, Wale Babalakin by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). The UNILAG chapter of ASUU also warned against the governing council meeting scheduled for Wednesday, July 15, at the Foyer of the Council Chambers. Oladejo Azeez, Registrar and Secretary to Council, in a statement on Sunday, said the meeting, apart from being statutory, was called by the Vice Chancellor, Professor Oluwatoyin Ogundipe. Azeez recalled that the VC requisitioned the meeting to Babalakin on May 11, 2020 and June 26, 2020 respectively. He noted that the time and topic by ASUU for their congress indicate plan to disrupt management meeting, especially since the body has issued threats to prevent the Babalakin from entering the university. The Registrar said the action “is violently against the provision of Section 41, subsection 1 of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) ( Fourth Alteration), which guarantees freedom of movement of Nigerians within Nigeria”. Azeez reminded ASUU that Section 4 of the Trade Union Act states that “No person shall subject any other person to any form of constraint or restriction in the course of persuasion.” The official said the UNILAG chapter has shown that it is a group that does not adhere to the Constitution of Nigeria or the Trade Union law which it is a part of. “As a responsible Council, we will not engage ASUU, University of Lagos branch on issues that are beyond its duties, powers and responsibilities under the laws of Nigeria. “We therefore advice all law abiding Nigerians to discountenance the action of the leadership of ASUU, University of Lagos branch and go about their legitimate duties as they will be protected under the laws of the federation”, Azeez added.

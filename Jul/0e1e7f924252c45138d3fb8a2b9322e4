Former Governor of Bayelsa State, Chief Seriake Dickson, has paid tribute to his successor, Douye Diri, over the verdict of the Supreme Court which affirmed him as the fittingly nominated candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for the 2019 governorship election in the state. DAILY POST had earlier reported that the apex court dismissed a suit by a PDP’s aspirant, Timi Alaibe challenging the emergence of Governor Douye Diri as the candidate of the PDP in the November 2019 governorship election in Bayelsa State. The suit was dismissed by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour, following its dramatic withdrawal by the appellant. Reacting, Dickson, in a statement by his media advisor, Mr. Fidelis Soriwei, on Tuesday, said that Gov. Diri could now focus his attention on the effective execution of the mandate given to him by the good people of Bayelsa without distraction. He said: “Having been at the forefront of the politics of the state for over two decades and occupied sensitive positions including being the first two-term Governor, and also being the one God used to midwife Bayelsa’s first-ever transition to select the Governor and his Deputy, this historical verdict is again a personal vindication and another show of God’s boundless mercy and grace for me as imperfect as I am. “My role from henceforth is to guide and provide advice when that advice is needed. I thank the leaders of the PDP and the delegates whose votes are now being vindicated today. I thank the national leadership of the party for their support. I join Governor Diri in saying there are no victors or losers. I thank the Supreme Court and their Lordships.”

Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said he was a delighted man after his side’s 2-1 win over Granada on Monday night. Ferland Mendy opened the scoring for Los Blancos with a fine solo effort, before Karim Benzema doubled their advantage. However, after the break, Darwin Machis pulled one back for the hosts. Real had to hold on for an important win, which opens a four-point gap at the top ahead of rivals Barcelona. “I let out a shout because I was happy and because in football you have to suffer. “I shouted out loud because the three points were very important and I wanted to tell my players that they had played a superb game. To win this league you have to suffer a little bit and we dug in as a team. You have to be proud of this team,” Zidane told the media about his full-time celebrations. Real Madrid will now have a chance to seal a first La Liga title since 2017 on Thursday against Villarreal.

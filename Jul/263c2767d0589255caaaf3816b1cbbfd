Arsenal hero, Paul Merson, has predicted that Liverpool will win the Premier League title next season again ahead of Manchester City. According to Merson, Liverpool is more consistent than Man City, adding that he would be surprised if Jurgen Klopp’s side does not win the English top-flight title next season. Recall that Liverpool won this year’s Premier League title ahead of second-place Man City. “I would be surprised if they [Liverpool] didn’t go on and do it again next season,” Merson told StarSport. “Manchester City are a brilliant team, make no mistake, and they can blow anyone away on their day. “But Liverpool are more consistent. They can win games when they are not playing well and City haven’t been able to do that because their defence hasn’t been as good.’ Merson added: ‘It’s a shame Liverpool had to lift the Premier League trophy in front of an empty stadium at Anfield. “I can remember the last time Liverpool won the title in 1990 because I was in the Arsenal side that did the same thing the following season. “Back then you knew if you finished above Liverpool, then you’d basically be champions. They were so dominant at that time. “But I think their fans will definitely get the chance to celebrate a Premier League trophy presentation inside Anfield in the future because this won’t be the last time Liverpool win the title.”

The Igbo community residing in Zamfara State has seriously demanded a full compensation for a doctor, Dr. Enoch Okpara, who was killed and burnt in his residence in Gusau, the state capital. In an exclusive interview with DAILY POST, the Igbo traditional leader in Zamfara state, Mr. Egbuna Obitiaku said both the Federal and the state government ought to have compensated the family of the deceased, pointing out that it is unconstitutional to bury the matter just like that. “I want the federal and state governments to understand that the Igbos are no longer safe in the north even though we all belong to one entity called Nigeria,” he lamented. According to him, the Igbos were about to take to the streets because of the gruesome murder of the doctor, saying that he blocked the demonstration for the sake of peace in the state. “There is a limit to human endurance and I can never stop my people from carrying out for their legitimate rights.” He, however, advised the government to as a matter of urgency address the issue before it becomes uncontrollable ” Egbuna further advised both the federal and state governments to act quickly before the Igbo youths in the East would begin to act negatively in a matter that is not above the capacities of both the federal and state governments. However, the Igbo traditional leader enjoined all Igbo men and women especially the people from the doctor’s hometown to be calm down as they are handling the situation tactfully and with care. “I want all of you to believe that you have leaders and no stone shall be left unturned and I have promised to do my best.”

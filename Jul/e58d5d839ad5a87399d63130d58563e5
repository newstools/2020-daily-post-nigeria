The Federal Government has rejected the increment of license fee proposed by the Nigerian Postal Service (NIPOST) for courier services. Isa Pantami, the Minister of Communication and Digital Economy, stated this in a tweet on Saturday morning. He made it clear that the increase was not part of the regulation he approved for the agency on Friday, July 24. “Our attention has been drawn to an increase of licence fee, which was not part of the regulation I earlier approved for you,” he stated. He added that NIPOST chairman and Post Master General, “were yesterday (Friday) contacted to put the implementation on hold and send a report to our ministry by Monday.” NIPOST’s proposed increase as announced, has attracted big criticism especially on social media. The new charges introduced by NIPOST would have led to an increase in the cost of courier services and delivery goods. According to NIPOST, companies which provide international courier services like DHL, UPS and FEDEX, are expected to pay N20m for a new licence, while those who offer national services are expected to pay N10m.

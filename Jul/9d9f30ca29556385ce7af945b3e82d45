Ifeoluwa Oyedele has debunked allegations that he collected money to step down for Governor Rotimi Akeredolu. Oyedele stated this while addressing his supporters in Akure, the Ondo State capital. According to the Executive Director of Niger Delta Power Holding Company Ltd, he stepped down for the greater interest of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the people of the state. He assured his supporters that he would not abandon them as he is a man of integrity. Oyedele further explained that what he negotiated with Akeredolu, was the future of the state and the betterment of its people. “No leader of the APC will look me in the face and offer me anything that is going to be of my own benefit. “I am a national leader of this party. All those in the negotiation table acknowledged that fact,” Oyedele said. Akeredolu has since emerged the APC candidate for the Ondo state governorship election.

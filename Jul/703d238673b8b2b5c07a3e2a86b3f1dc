The U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ICE, is set to deport foreign students in the United States whose schools will switch to online classes due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program, SEVP, which is run by ICE, made the announcement in a statement on Monday. The new rule states that foreign nationals enrolled in U.S. educational institutions will have to deploy other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person or they must take the online classes out of the country or risk deportation if they stay. Also, the U.S Department of State will no longer issue visas to students if they are going to schools that offer online classes only. The statement reads, “The U.S. Department of State no longer issue visas to students enrolled in schools or programs that are fully online for the fall semester nor will U.S. Customs and Border Protection permit such students to enter the United States. “Active students who currently in the United States and enrolled in such programs must leave the country or take other measures, such as transferring to a school with in-person instruction to remain in lawful status. “If not, they will have to face immigration consequences. “Non-immigrant students attending schools adopting a hybrid model that is, a mixture of online and in-person classes will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online. “These schools must clarify with the SEVP, through the “Certificate of Eligibility for Non-immigrant Student Status,” certifying that the program is not entirely online, that the students are not taking an entirely online course load this semester, and that the student is taking the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree program. “The above exemptions do not apply to students in English language training programs or students pursuing vocational degrees, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses. “Schools are also required to update their information in the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, SEVIS, within 10 days of the change if they begin the fall semester with in-person classes but are later required to switch to only online classes, or a non-immigrant student changes their course selections, and as a result, ends up taking an online course load. “Non-immigrant students within the US are not permitted to take a full course of study through online classes. “Students who find themselves in this category, must exist the country or take alternative steps such as a reduced course load or appropriate medical leave to maintain their non-immigrant status.” See picture below… <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813788" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa1.jpg" alt="" width="812" height="2289" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa1.jpg 812w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa1-106x300.jpg 106w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa1-363x1024.jpg 363w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa1-545x1536.jpg 545w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa1-727x2048.jpg 727w" sizes="(max-width: 812px) 100vw, 812px"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813787" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa2.jpg" alt="" width="724" height="2503" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa2.jpg 724w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa2-87x300.jpg 87w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa2-296x1024.jpg 296w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa2-444x1536.jpg 444w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/usa2-592x2048.jpg 592w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px">

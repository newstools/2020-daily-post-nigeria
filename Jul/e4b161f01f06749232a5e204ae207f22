Nat Adojutelegan, one of All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirants for the Ondo governorship election, has urged the party to reconcile factions. He warned that failure to achieve unity before the poll may cause a repeat of what happened in Zamfara State. In 2019, the Supreme Court handed victory to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) even though the APC won the majority votes. The apex court ruled that the party failed to submit the name of its flagbearer within the stipulated time. Adojutelegan, after submitting his expression of interest and nomination forms, recalled the 2018 APC Congress in Ondo was fraught with irregularities. The aspirant pointed out that the fallout of the congress, which produced parallel executive committees was still pending in court. On the mode of primary, he said “11 of the 12 aspirants contesting in the primary election prefer direct primary. I respectfully ask the national leadership of the party to adopt direct primary.” Adojutelegan explained that his suggestion would unify all members, ensure they are not disenfranchised, create a level playing field for aspirants, and avoid “the Zamfara experience.”

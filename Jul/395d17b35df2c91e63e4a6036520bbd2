Led in evidence by prosecuting counsel, M. T. Iko, Suleiman told the court how the agency conducted investigations that led to the suspect’s arrest in Umuahia, Abia State.

He disclosed that in the course of the investigation, letters questioning his activities were written to Egypt, Thailand and United States Embassies, United Bank for Africa (UBA), Polaris Bank and Ecobank. The letters marked as Exhibit A1 to E respectively were accepted by the court as evidence. Kingsley is a native of Umurokoala North LGA of Abia State. He is being prosecuted on eight-count charges bordering on conspiracy, impersonation, forgery, possession of proceeds and obtaining money by false pretence to the tune of $8,502,000. Kingsley allegedly presented himself as one Jeff Sikora, President/CEO of Prime Trust Credit Union Bank in America. He used the false identity to defraud his victims. They included an Egyptian defrauded of the sum of $6,500,000. Kingsley told the victim that he was a beneficiary of inheritance funds in a fixed deposit account in Prime Trust Financial Bank. Justice Mohammed adjourned the matter to July 16 and 17 for the continuation of trial.

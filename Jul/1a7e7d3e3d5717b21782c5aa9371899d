The United States Government has expanded the scope of metals sanctions on Iran. America has added 22 materials connected to Iran’s nuclear, military or ballistic missile programmes. Secretary of State, Michael Pompeo made the announcement on Thursday. The official insisted that Iran’s programmes were a grave threat to international security. Pompeo warned companies and individuals in both countries against transfer of the identified metals. “Those who knowingly transfer such materials to Iran are now sanctionable pursuant to Section 1245 of the Iranian Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act,” Pompeo said. The banned metals include different alloys of aluminum, copper, steel and aluminum powder with purity above 98 percent. In 2018, President Donald Trump pulled US out of the Iran nuclear deal. He said the agreement negiotiated by President Barack Obama failed to address Tehran’s ballistic missile programme.

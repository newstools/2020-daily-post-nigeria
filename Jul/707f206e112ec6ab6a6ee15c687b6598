The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has condemned President Muhammadu Buhari over his trip to Mali. HURIWA described Buhari’s peace-making trip to Mali as shameful The civil rights advocacy group wondered why Buhari should travel to Mali on a peace-making mission when Nigeria was having challenges of Insecurity. A statement by HURIWA’s National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko and its National Media Affairs Director, Zainab Yusuf lamented the killings by Fulani herdsmen across the country. The statement reads partly: “We condemn the shameful Peace-making mission by President Muhammadu Buhari; President and Commander in Chief of the Armed forces of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to Mali when half of Nigeria is on fire due to Insecurity. “Insecurity could be said to be the greatest challenge facing the administration of President Buhari. Since the return to democracy in 1999, traditional security threats such as violent conflicts, militancy, armed robbery and kidnapping have assumed worrisome dimensions in Nigeria. Evolving threats such as insurgency and terrorism have further complicated the situation. “The internal situation in Nigeria calls for greater attention, as the country continues to suffer all manner of security challenges, ranging from wide-spread robbery to kidnapping, ethnoreligious conflicts, and now terrorism. Just like other years since 2015, this year 2020 is not so different. Security-wise, Nigeria is currently going through ups and downs. From kidnappings to murders, suicide bombings, armed robbery, car snatching, terrorism, armed Fulani herdsmen attacks to the continued disappearance of Leah Sharibu, arrests and flouting of court orders, amongst others. This 2020 is a deodorizer of events.”

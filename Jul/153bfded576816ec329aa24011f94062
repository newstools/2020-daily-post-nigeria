Former Glee star, Naya Rivera is presumed dead. She played high school cheerleader Santana Lopez in the television series until 2015. Rivera, 33, drowned while boating on a lake near Los Angeles. The actress went missing on Wednesday after renting a boat on Lake Piru with her four-year-old son Josey. Her body has not been found 24 hours after she was last seen, Rueters reports. On Thursday, Ventura Country Sheriff’s spokesman, Chris Dyer, said they were “presuming that an accident happened and that she drowned in the lake”. The son was found alone and sleeping in a drifting boat. He told authorities they had both gone swimming but his mother never returned. Sgt. Kevin Donoghue told reporters that if the body is entangled in something beneath the water, it may never come back up. “This is a terrible tragedy for all of them,” Donoghue said, adding that the search would resume on Friday. Glee, the musical drama about a high school choir, was one of the biggest pop culture hits 10 years ago. In 2013, Cory Monteith, who played football player Finn, died of a drug overdose. In 2018, Mark Salling, who played Puck, killed himself after pleading guilty to possessing child pornography.

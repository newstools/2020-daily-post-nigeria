Southampton striker, Michael Obafemi, has revealed the advice manager, Ralph Hasenhuttl, told him before he scored a late goal against Manchester United in their Premier League 2-2 draw on Monday night. Man United failed to beat Southampton at Old Trafford after Michael Obafemi scored in the 96th minute to ensure the Hasenhuttl’s side got a point against the Red Devils. Speaking to Sky Sport after the game, Obafemi said that Hasenhuttl told him to arrive at the back post to boost his chances of scoring and it paid off in style. Obafemi said: “He [Hasenhuttl] told me what to do. He told me to get to the back post, and I got there, and I scored the goal. “It’s what I’m here to do, to score goals and thankfully, I got the equalizer. Obafemi added: “We’ve picked up amazing results ever since the restart. We look to finish the season strong. “We go into any game thinking we can get three points.” The result means Southampton are now in the 12th position on the log with 45 points after 35 games. The Saints will host Brighton in their next fixture on Thursday.

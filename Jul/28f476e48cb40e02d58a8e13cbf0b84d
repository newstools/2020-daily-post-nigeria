Former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has reacted to the claim by a Nigerian frontline lawyer, Barrister Olusegun Bamgbose, that he may return to the All Progressives Congress, APC, ahead of the 2023 presidential election . Bamgbose in a chat with DAILY POST on Friday, said “As we draw closer to 2023 Presidential race and politicians are busy strategising on how to be relevant, I foresee Atiku defecting back to APC. “This may seem absurd and incredible, but it will come to pass. This, however, is conditioned on APC not splitting before the end of 2021. “The ignoble sack of Oshiomhole, by the power brokers in APC, has, in fact, signaled a new dawn in APC. Other things being equal, APC is getting set to zone its presidential slot to the North.” According to him, all this put together will make the former Vice President retrace his steps back to the ruling party. Atiku Abubakar dumped the ruling APC in 2018 ahead of the 2019 presidential election which he contested on the platform of the PDP and lost to the incumbent President and candidate of the APC, Muhammadu Buhari. “The Northern oligarchy won’t back him come 2023. The North hardly backed a multi-billionaire to become President of Nigeria…” Bamgbose added. But reacting to the claim through a tweet by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Paul Ibe, the 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, said, “Mr. Olusegun Bamgbose’s so called ‘seeing’ is delusional, possibly induced by cerebral malaria, and requires immediate intensive medical help. “He is a third-rate seer and is urged to desist from this mischief.”

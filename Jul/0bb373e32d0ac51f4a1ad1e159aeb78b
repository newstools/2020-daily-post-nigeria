A Federal High Court sitting in Benin City has adjourned the trial of Osagie Ize-Iyamu, along with others, due to his ill-health. Others are ex-Edo Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Chairman, Dan Orbih; his successor, Tony Aziegbemi; ex-Edo Deputy Governor, Lucky Imasuen, and Efe Erimuoghae-Anthony. Ize-Iyamu is the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Edo State. The court had on June 18, validated the corruption charges against the defendants, and, therefore, adjourned the case until July 7 for hearing. All five are being tried on money laundering charges filed against them by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The defendants are accused of receiving public funds to the tune of N700million for the 2015 general elections. They allegedly conspired and committed the offence in March 2015, by taking possession and control of the funds without any contract award. On Tuesday, Charles Edosomwan (SAN), Ize-Iyamuâ€™s lawyer, told the court that his client was absent because he was currently indisposed. Edosomwan prayed the judge to allow him to present the certificate of ill-health as certified by his medical doctor. Justice Mohammed Garba Umar, after listening to the counsel, adjourned the case until July 14 for hearing.

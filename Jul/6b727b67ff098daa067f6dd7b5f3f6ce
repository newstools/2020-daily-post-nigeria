The Lagos State Government has provided alternative routes for motorists to use, during the partial closure of the Third Mainland Bridge. In a statement signed by the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, on Friday, the six-month exercise, would target “fixing the worn out expansion joints on the structure of the bridge.” Oladeinde noted that ongoing repair works on the alternative routes were being rounded up in readiness for the partial closure which begins on Friday, July 24. He advised motorists driving towards Ikeja and Ikorodu from Osborne Road, Ikoyi in the morning to use the Carter Bridge to access Eko Bridge through Ijora Olopa. This would lead them through Funsho Williams Avenue to Doman Long Bridge to Ikorodu. Or use Carter Bridge to Iddo through Oyingbo to Herbert Macaulay to Jibowu and link Ikorodu Road. For motorists leaving Victoria Island, he urged them to drive through Ozumba Mbadiwe Road to Falomo Bridge through Alfred Rewane to Old Kingsway Road, Osborn to Ilubirin and Catter Bridge. A second option for this category of motorists is to take Bonny Camp to Independence Bridge to Marina Bridge through Apongbon to Eko Bridge, Ijora Olopa, Iddo, and Oyingbo. Stressing further, the Commissioner urged afternoon road users inbound Lagos Island to use Ojota on Ikorodu road to access Funsho Williams Avenue through Eko Bridge/Apongbon axis or utilize Ikorodu road to access Fadeyi/Jibowu/Yaba axis and also access Oyingbo-Iddo to Carter Bridge. Alternatively, Oladeinde stated that motorists can use Oshodi/Charity through Agege Motor Road to access Cappa to link Ilupeju Bypass or Mushin to get to Town Planning Way to link Ikorodu road or access Moshalasi/Idi-Oro from Mushin to access Funsho Williams avenue and connect Eko Bridge to get to Apongbon or use Empire road to access Yaba to link Oyingbo-Iddo axis.

One Mr. Joseph Akporugo has been arrested alongside his wife, Janet Akporugo, for allegedly maltreating a seven-year-old girl, over claims that she was a witch. Police said the girl is the granddaughter of the 57-year-old Joseph Akporugo. It was gathered that the little girl has wounds all over her body after she was allegedly burnt by the couple. According to a statement by the Ogun State Police Spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Wednesday, the girl had walked into the resident of a police constable living in their neighbourhood in Awa-Ijebu, to recount her ordeals. She was said to have reported to the constable the maltreatment being meted out to her by her grandfather and his wife, “who she has been living with since the death of her biological father.” Oyeyemi informed that the girl explained to the cop, how the couple put rubber on fire and used it to burn her all over her body, on the allegation that she is a witch. Their accusation against her, Oyeyemi hinted, was that she was the one who killed her biological father with her witchcraft. “The Constable there and then brought her to Awa-Ijebu police station where the case was incidented,” he said. The DPO, CSP Adewalehinmi was said to have detailed detectives to the couple’s house and got them arrested. While interrogated, police told DAILY POST that the couple could not justify “their devilish maltreatment of the innocent little girl.” Kenneth Ebrimson, the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, said the case should be properly investigated so as to prosecute the suspects.

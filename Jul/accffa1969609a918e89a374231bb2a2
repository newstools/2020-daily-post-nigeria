President of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Rev Samson Ayokunle, has asked state governments to reopen churches. He said the continued lockdown order on the places of worship was no longer acceptable and justifiable. A statement on Tuesday by his spokesman, Bayo Oladeji, said that despite the directive Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, states like Lagos and Ogun were yet to allow worship places reopen. “What sin have the places of worship committed?”, CAN quipped. The body recalled that when coronavirus broke out, it agreed with the government on the need to close down the places of worship, schools and others. CAN said with the reopening of the economy, some markets, airports and schools, the closure of churches anywhere must end. “Is it not our members in the places of worship that go to markets and other sectors? Is it that people cannot contract the virus in the markets and airports?” CAN reminded the authorities that the Church too has a role to play by seeking for divine solutions as well. The statement added that while the Christian leadership believes that COVID-19 deserves attention, state governments should not “turn a deaf ear to our quest”.

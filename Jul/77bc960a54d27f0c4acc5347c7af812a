The Minority leader in the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu, has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to sack his service chiefs, following the attack on the convoy of Borno state Governor, Babagana Zulum. Elumelu, in a statement on Friday, said the service chiefs could not handle the security situation in the country and need to step aside. Gov. Zulum had accused the military of complicity in the attack by bandits suspected to be members of Boko Haram. Elumelu has now urged Buhari to immediately implement the recent resolution of both chambers of the National Assembly, asking him to sack his Service Chiefs. “The worsening security situation in the country under the current Service Chiefs has reached an unbearable state to the extent that insurgents have the temerity to attack the convoy of a state governor. “This is more so with the insistence by Governor Zulum of compromise of the security system in the area, allegedly creating an opening to the attack; a position that validates the call for immediate reorganizing of the nation’s security architecture. “We the opposition lawmakers hereby in the strongest terms restate the call to President Muhammadu Buhari to honor the resolution of the National Assembly and immediately remove the Service Chiefs and bring in new hands to effectively confront the security challenges confronting our nation,” Elumelu said.

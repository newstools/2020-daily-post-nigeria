Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, says he would prefer that youngster, Bukayo Saka, plays for England instead of Nigeria at senior level. While Saka grew up in England and had represented the country at youth levels, the 18-year-old’s parents are Nigerians. Recently, the young winger said it would be tough for him to choose between Nigeria and England. However, speaking to Daily Mail, Saka’s Spanish coach, said, “If I get asked the question then I can give my opinion.” The Arsenal boss, however, noted that the youngster has not come to him for advice, adding that “for now, I will leave it totally independent with the player and his family as they normally have a big say with their background, their culture and where they are coming from. I don’t want to step in there.” Arteta insisted that Saka is “Absolutely [he is good enough to play for England] – and he’s very clever to make the right decision, as well.”

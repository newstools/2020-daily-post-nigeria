UEFA have confirmed that up to eight Premier League teams could play in the Champions League and Europa League next season, according to Sky Sports. Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea have already qualified for the Champions League group stage next season, after finishing in the top four places in the 2019/2020 campaign. Leicester, who finished in fifth place, have qualified for the Europa League group stage next season. Tottenham Hotspur were sixth and also qualified for the Europa League second qualifying round. If Manchester City or Chelsea go on to win the Champions League this season, there will be no extra slot for an English club next season. Also, if Manchester United win the Europa League and qualify for the Champions League group stage – which they have already reached through Premier League top-four spot – there will be no additional slot for an English club. If Chelsea beat Arsenal in the FA Cup final this weekend, Tottenham do not need to play in Europa League qualifying round. Wolves will qualify for the Europa League’s second qualifying round, as the Premier League’s seventh-placed team. However, if Arsenal win, the Gunners will qualify for the Europa League group stage. Wolves will only play in Europe if they win the Europa League this season. The only way eight Premier League clubs could play in European competitions next season: Wolves join Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea in the Champions League group stage next season as Europa League winners. Arsenal qualify for the Europa League group stage as FA Cup winners. Leicester will have qualified for the Europa League group stage next season as the fifth-placed team.

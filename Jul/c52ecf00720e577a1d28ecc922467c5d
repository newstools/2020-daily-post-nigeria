The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has claimed the former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, is making a u-turn, by presenting a candidate he previously castigated. Wike stated this on Saturday, during the flag-off of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) campaign for the Edo State governorship election in Benin City, the state capital. According to him, the South-South region of the country belongs to the PDP. Wike, who is Chairman of the PDP National Campaign Council for the election, said: “Former national Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole is making a u-turn to lick his vomit by presenting a candidate he earlier rejected and castigated. “Four years ago, Adams Oshiomhole said he cannot trust the APC governorship candidate, that he was rusticated from school. “Today, Oshiomhole is coming back to present the same person to Edo people. He thinks Edo people are fools. I challenge Edo people not to vote for any person presented to them by Oshiomhole.”

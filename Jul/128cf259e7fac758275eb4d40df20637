Manchester United midfielder, Nemanja Matic, on Monday signed a new three-year contract extension with the club. The 31-year-old will now remain at Old Trafford until the summer of 2023. Matic has been a key figure in Man United’s impressive form since the Premier League’s restart, coming off the bench against Tottenham before starting in each of their last three league wins. The Serbian international joined Man United from Chelsea in 2017 following three-and-a-half years at Stamford Bridge. The 31-year-old has since featured 114 times for the Red Devils, scoring four goals. “I’m very happy that I will continue to be part of this great club,” Matic told the club’s website. “As a player, I still have a lot more to give and achieve in my career and to do that with Manchester United will be a huge honour.” Reacting, Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, told Man United’s official website: “I’m delighted that Nemanja has signed a new contract. “I know his experience, professionalism and leadership will be invaluable to this young talented group. “We have great strength in midfield, and Nemanja’s attributes are a key part of that. “Nemanja has been here for 3 seasons now and really understands the values of playing for Manchester United.”

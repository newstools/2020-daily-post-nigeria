Women from Ihitte-uboma local government area of Imo State have protested the brutal killing of madam Uchechi Okafor by unidentified assassins last weekend. The women clad in black attires protested in Ihitte-uboma council area of the state and displayed placards with various inscriptions. Addressing the women, the state Commissioner for Special Projects, Simon Ebegbulem described the development as barbaric, promising that perpetrators will soon be apprehended. He lamented that several killings have occurred within the last few months in the same LGA. The Commissioner disclosed that he is in touch with the state Police Commissioner over the issue, commending the protesting women for their peaceful demonstration. “The perpetrators of these dastardly acts must be apprehended and brought to book. They will not go unpunished.” Recall that the lawmaker representing Ihitte-uboma state constituency in Imo House of Assembly, Michael Onyemechi Njoku recently moved a motion urging the state government to wade into the incessant killings in the community. DAILY POST gathered that the slain mother, Uchechi Okafor was found dead in her farm in a pool of her own blood.

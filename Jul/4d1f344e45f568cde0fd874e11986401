The Adamawa State Government has fixed August 4 as the resumption date for students in Junior Secondary Schools (JSS) and Senior Secondary Schools (SSS) as well as primary six pupils that will be writing their terminal examinations. Mrs. Wilbina Jackson, the State’s Commissioner for Education and Human Capital disclosed this in a statement on Wednesday in Yola. The statement read in part, “Governor Ahmadu Fintiri has directed that the resumption date for the 2019-20 Academic session in the state for the existing students in Primary six, JSS3 and SSS3 is August 4, 2020. “Subsequently, resumption is to be observed strictly within the necessary COVID-19 preventive guidelines as outlined by the NCDC.” Jackson, however, called on traditional rulers, religious leaders and other stakeholders to educate their wards and communities over the development. Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria is 29,879, according to NCDC.

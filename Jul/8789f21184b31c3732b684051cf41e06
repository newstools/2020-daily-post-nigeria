Former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has alleged that Ibrahim Magu, the suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, worked for Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, and the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu while in office. He insisted that Osinbajo and Tinubu are the two godfathers of Magu. Fani-Kayode also claimed that Magu never worked for President Muhammadu Buhari while in office. According to him, what is happening to Magu, who is being held at the Police headquarters, Abuja, over allegations of lack of transparency in managing recovered assets and mismanagement of the EFCC, was planned years ago. Fani-Kayode said this in a tweet on his official Twitter handle on Sunday night. He said: “What is happening to Magu today was planned years ago. “The real target is not Magu but those he worked for and protected for the last 4 years. “He NEVER worked for Buhari. He worked for Tinubu & Osinbajo. “When they finish crushing him, they will move against his two godfathers.” Magu is expected to reappear before the Justice Ayo Salami probe panel on Monday, to defend himself against several other allegations. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-815975" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fani.jpg" alt="" width="597" height="225" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fani.jpg 597w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/fani-300x113.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px">

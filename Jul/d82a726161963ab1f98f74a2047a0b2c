Hamzat made the appeal while speaking with newsmen in Lagos. The Medical Guild is the Association of Medical Doctors under the employment of the Lagos State Government. The doctors had on Monday began a three-day warning strike over issues affecting their safety and welfare. Hamzat said it was wrong for the doctors to go on strike at a time when the Coronavirus pandemic was ravaging the state and country at large, NAN reports. “This is not the right time when there is a global issue. It is inhumane, wrong and we must call a spade a spade. “Are we going to mortgage the lives of our people? Please doctors go back to work so that you can serve and protect the people you have sworn to protect,” he added.

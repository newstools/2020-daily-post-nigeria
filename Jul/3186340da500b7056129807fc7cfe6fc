Only students in Senior Secondary 3 classes will resume in Lagos and Ogun states. This was confirmed by the Lagos Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, on Tuesday, according to The Nation. The Federal Ministry of Education has earlier given go-ahead for resumption of JSS3 and SS3 classes in secondary schools. The Special Adviser to the Ogun State Governor on Education, Mrs. Ronke Soyombo, also confirmed resumption for only SS3 pupils. However, the Ekiti Education Commissioner, Mr. Foluso Daramola, said a decision would be taken on JSS3 classes after a meeting with Governor Kayode Fayemi. “I am just coming from a meeting at the Governor’s Office on the issue. We will make a statement on it,” Daramola said. Federal Government Colleges (aka Unity Schools) will resume August 4 for SS3 pupils only.

Chelsea has announced their new intake of academy scholars, with three Nigerian starlets making the cut. According to a statement on the club’s website, they are goalkeepers Kelechi Chibueze and Prince Adegoke as well as defender Derick Abu. They have all been offered scholarships for the 2020/2021 season. The three Nigerians signed their contracts in a socially-distanced signing session at Cobham this week. “All players in their Under-17 year are required to start the season on a scholarship agreement before they are permitted to sign a first professional football contract on or after their 17th birthday,” part of the statement read. Only Adegoke, 16, has been officially invited to train with the Golden Eaglet. However, he could not travel because of the club and educational commitments. Abu, Adegoke and Chibueze have been promoted to Chelsea under-18 squad for the 2020/2021 campaign.

A former Real Madrid and Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted that Chelsea will beat Crystal Palace in today’s Premier League clash at Selhurst Park. Owen also backed Arsenal to defeat Leicester City 2-0 when both teams clash at the Emirates Stadium tonight. Chelsea defeated Watford 3-0 in their last Premier League clash over the weekend, while Arsenal won 2-0 against Wolves. Providing his prediction, Owen wrote in his column for BetVictor: “Chelsea have won 15 of the 21 matches between these two sides in the Premier League, and you have to go back to 2017 for the last time the Eagles managed a win. “I see this being another win for Chelsea, adding further pressure to those teams in and around the Champions League qualification places.” On the Arsenal vs Leicester fixture, Owen said: “Arsenal made their claims for a Europa League spot power of good with an impressive 2-0 victory over Wolves at Molineux on Saturday, and that will have really given Mikel Arteta a huge boost going into the closing stages of the season. “Leicester got their quest for a top-four finish right back on track with their first win since the restart when they beat Crystal Palace 3-0 at the King Power Stadium. “One worrying stat for all Foxes fans is that they haven’t been able to record a win away at Arsenal in 26 attempts in all competitions, and that was before I was born (2-0 on September 8th 1973). “I see that unenviable run continuing with a 2-1 home win to the Gunners.” The kick-off time for Arsenal vs Leicester City is 8: 15 pm, while that of Crystal Palace vs Chelsea is 6 pm.

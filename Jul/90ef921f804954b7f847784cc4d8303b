The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved the use of two types of spray against coronavirus. The announcement was made in a statement on Monday. EPA approved Lysol Disinfectant Spray and Lysol Disinfectant Max Cover Mist. The body said these are the “first List N products” which the agency has reviewed laboratory testing data and approved label claims”. EPA is expected to approve such claims for additional List N products in the coming weeks. It explained that the approval was based on laboratory testing that showed the products were effective against COVID-19. The Administrator, Andrew Wheeler, said EPA remains committed to identifying new tools and providing accurate and up-to-date information to help the American public protect themselves and their families from coronavirus. The official added that EPA’s review of products tested against this virus “marks an important milestone in President Trump’s government approach towards fighting the spread of COVID-19.”

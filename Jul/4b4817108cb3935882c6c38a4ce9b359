Barcelona face a big battle to retain their LaLiga crown, following a 2-2 draw with Atletico Madrid at home on Tuesday night. The champions went in front in the 11th minute, after Lionel Messi’s corner was flicked into his own net by Diego Costa. Atletico responded almost immediately, as Yannick Carrasco was fouled in the box, but Marc Ter Stegen saved Costa’s effort. However, a retake was ordered by the referee and this time, Saul Niguez slotted home coolly. Lionel Messi restored Barca’s lead from the spot, but Niguez then buried his second spot kick of the game. Quique Setien’s side will end the week four points behind rivals Real Madrid, if Zinedine Zidane’s team defeat Getafe on Thursday.

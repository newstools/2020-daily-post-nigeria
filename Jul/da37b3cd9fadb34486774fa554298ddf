Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has made a u-turn, and he’s now pushing for a transfer move for Aston Villa captain, Jack Grealish, after concerns over the Red Devils squad depth, the Independent UK reports. Man United initially cooled their interest in Grealish over the last few weeks, but Solskjaer has now reconsidered after realising that his squad was short of options during the 2019/20 Premier League run-in. DAILY POST had reported that Grealish had drawn the interest of Man United in the few months. The 24-year-old, alongside Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho was among four-man attacking midfielders shortlisted by United to sign this summer’s transfer window. Grealish has already been told he may not be a regular starter under Solskjaer, who is expected to have additional funds to work with after qualifying the Old Trafford club to next season’s Champions League. Aston Villa will demand in excess of £50 million for Grealish. Speaking on Grealish’s future, Aston Villa coach, Dean Smith said on Sunday after his side’s Premier League 1-1 draw with West Ham United that the midfielder’s future will be resolved within the next month. Smith also warned Man United that the Grealish would not be sold in a cut-price deal. “I have said many times before we have billionaire owners,” Smith said at a post-match press conference. “If people want to come and get our best players, they will cost an awful lot of money. “Grealish is an Aston Villa fan and will be immensely proud he scored the goal today which kept us in the Premier League.” Grealish played a pivotal part in Aston Villa’s push for Premier League survival. He scored eight goals and registered six assists in 36 appearances for Villa.

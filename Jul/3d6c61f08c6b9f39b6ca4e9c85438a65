Barcelona stars want Quique Setien sacked as manager and former player, Patrick Kluivert hired, according to Mundo Deportivo. Setien is under increasing pressure, after Real Madrid snatched the LaLiga title from Barca last week. Kluivert, who scored 122 goals in 256 games for Barcelona as a player, is currently their academy director. After the former Holland striker hung up his boots, he became an assistant coach at Dutch side AZ Alkmaar and NEC Nijmegen. He then took on the role of head coach of the FC Twente’s reserve side and won the reserves league with them. Kluivert was Louis van Gaal’s assistant manager for the Netherlands national team, when they finished third at the 2014 World Cup. From there he became the head coach of the Curacao national team before taking over Ajax’s under-19 side where he coached his son, Justin.

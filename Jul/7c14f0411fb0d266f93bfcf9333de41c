Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said he is not sure he will remain at the club next season. Zidane this week led Los Blancos to their 34th LaLiga title, following a 2-1 win over Villarreal on Thursday. The Frenchman is now only three trophies short of Miguel Munoz’s club record of 14 pieces of silverware, having lifted the Spanish league title twice, the Supercopa de Espana twice, the Champions League three times, the UEFA Super Cup twice and two FIFA Club World Cups during his two stints in charge. Zidane ended his first stint as manager five days after winning his third Champions League, claiming the club “needed a change”. But he returned less than a year later in March 2019, after Santiago Solari and Julien Lopetegui were sacked. Zidane’s current deal at the Bernabeu runs until 2022, but he has refused to guarantee that he will be in the dugout next year. “No-one knows what will happen,” he said at a press conference on Saturday. “I have a contract. I like being here, but you never know what will happen in football. “It changes from one day to the next in this sport. I don’t know what will happen in the future.”

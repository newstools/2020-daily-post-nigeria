Nigerian female singer, Seyi Shay has said her husband can have more than one ‘sidechick.’ The singer revealed this during Simi’s “Stoopid sessions” According to her, she is comfortable with the idea of her partner having ‘sidechicks’ but not just one particular one. When asked if she would allow her partner to have a side chic, Seyi Shay said: “I will actually be cool with my man having ‘chicks’ outside, as long as they are ‘chicks’ and not one. The 34-year-old singer stressed that her partner having just one side chic will be a problem to her as she feels he definitely will become attached to that person. “If my man has one chic on the side, then he is more likely to fall in love with that one chic but if he has got many chicks outside, and he’s doing his thing but I’m number one clearly in every way, it is fine,” Seyi Shay added. She, however, concluded that her partner must have the conversation with her in the beginning that there are people.

Prof. Akin Abayomi, Lagos State Commissioner for Health, has confirmed that the State has so far recorded 177 COVID-19 deaths. He also revealed that the state has conducted a total of 42,348 tests for COVID-19. Abayomi, who gave the confirmation on his Twitter page, said that out of the 42,348 samples, 10,926 returned positive. “Out of the total number of confirmed cases, 1,695 patients have since been discharged from the Lagos COVID-19 care centres following full recovery. “A total of 6,259 of the cases monitored in communities by COVID-19 Lagos Response Team have either fully recovered or are positively responding to treatments,” he said. He explained that 2,430 active cases in the communities were yet to turn up for admittance in care centres. According to him, it may be due to fear of stigmatization or preference for home care treatments. He, therefore, urged the state residents to observe physical distancing and regular washing of hands.

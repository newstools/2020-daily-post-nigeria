Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has urged the Presidential Panel investigating the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, to formalize his detention. He said the panel should do this by obtaining a 28-days Remand Order from a court to enable them complete the investigations of the embattled Magu. Fayose had earlier called on President Muhammadu Buhari to order an investigation into the sales of properties seized by the EFCC under Magu. In a series of tweets on Saturday, the former Governor also berated Magu’s lawyer, Wahab Shittu, who had expressed concern over the continued detention of his client. “The Panel should formalize Magu’s detention by obtaining a 28-days Remand Order from court to enable the completion of investigations,” Fayose said. “The panel must equally get a Temporary & Permanent Forfeiture of loots linked to him. That’s Magu’s style & procedure while in office. He can’t complain now “Wahab Shittu, EFCC lawyer turned Magu’s defender understands their style, so why is he complaining? “Or didn’t he work with Magu to secure court orders to detain people indefinitely and forfeit properties linked to people being investigated?” President Muhammadu Buhari had on Friday suspended Magu as the acting chairman of the EFCC. The agency’s Director of Operations, Mohammed Umar, has taken charge and now oversees the activities of the Commission pending the conclusion of the ongoing investigation into Magu’s case.

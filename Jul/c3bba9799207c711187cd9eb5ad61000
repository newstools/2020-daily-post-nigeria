Bayer Leverkusen’s Kai Havertz is pushing hard for the club to agree a deal with Chelsea, before their Europa League tie against Rangers next week. Havertz wants to join the Blues and only an agreement about the transfer fee is delaying the deal. Leverkusen value Havertz at £90m, but all parties are hopeful a deal can be done at £70m plus add-ons. Chelsea’s qualification for the Champions League, means Frank Lampard has more money to spend after signing Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech. Havertz is back in training with Leverkusen ahead of the Rangers game, but the 21-year-old would like the deal completed before that match. It will be a busy summer at Stamford Bridge with Lampard also looking for a new goalkeeper, left-back and centre-back.

The Commissioner of Police in Rivers State, CP Joseph Mukan, has asked Governor Nyesom Wike to hand over the former Acting Managing Director of NDDC, Joi Nunieh. Governor Wike on Thursday prevented the arrest of Nunieh from armed Police Officers from the IGP Monitoring Team at her residence in Old GRA, Port Harcourt. Nunieh is currently taking refuge at Government House Port Harcourt. CP Mukan while reacting to Thursday’s incident also dismissed the rumour that efforts were made to reach him, insisting that no one reached out to him in connection to Nunieh’s arrest. He said the Governor was wrong to have whisked Nunieh away without recourse to the Law. According to him, “What people fail to understand is that it is not in every situation that you need warrant of arrest before you can arrest anybody. It depends on the crime of the individual. “It is really unfortunate what happened yesterday because when the Governor said he is going to rescue her (Nunieh), he should hand her over to me. I am the Commissioner of Police in Rivers state and I am in a better position to take her. “Nobody is saying the Governor should not protect his citizens but everything should be done within the confines of the law. I am the Chief Law officer of the Command and he wants to rescue his citizen you hand her over to the police for safety. “I still believe he (Wike) is going to turn her (Nunieh) in because the Police were on a legitimate duty,” Mukan said.

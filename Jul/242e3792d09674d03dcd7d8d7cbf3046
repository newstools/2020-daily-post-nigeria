United States President, Donald Trump has called for the postponement of the 2020 election. On Thursday, the American leader made the call on Twitter. Trump expressed concern that the election would be fraudulent. His reason was the controversial universal mail-in voting. “With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting, which is good), 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly, securely and safely vote???”, he tweeted. The presidential election is scheduled for November. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-822841 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_20200730-150119_Twitter-1024x1008.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="728" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_20200730-150119_Twitter-1024x1008.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_20200730-150119_Twitter-300x295.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_20200730-150119_Twitter-80x80.jpg 80w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_20200730-150119_Twitter-45x45.jpg 45w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Screenshot_20200730-150119_Twitter.jpg 1075w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

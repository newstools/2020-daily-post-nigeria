Tanzanian actress, Wema Sepetu has said she missed being assaulted by her ex-boyfriend, Diamond Platnumz. The singer and the Actress dated sometime ago but their relationship ended in 2014. However, Sepetu has come out six years later disclosing that Diamond Platnumz used to “beat her up”. In her interview with Swahili newspaper, Ijumaa Wikienda, the Actress said: “Diamond would beat me up thoroughly back then. “Ironically, I loved it when he battered me, I just don’t know why that was the case. According to her, she loved it when he assaulted her because he would pamper her after that. “But, I remember he would pamper me after assaulting me, and, I think I loved it because he would give me attention after the beating.” She added that she honestly missed being assaulted by him, a lot. “I remember there was a day he saw a suggestive message on my phone. Out of anger, he gave me a hard slap on the cheek. “My siblings got to know that I was a victim of domestic abuse. They pleaded with me to leave Diamond but I told them I was enjoying being beaten up by him,” Sapetu added.

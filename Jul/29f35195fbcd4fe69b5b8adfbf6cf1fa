President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to sack the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami. Austin Okah, National Coordinator of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Youth Frontier, made the call in a statement on Saturday. He said Malami’s exit would will pave way for an unbiased investigation of responses Ibrahim Magu, suspended chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), provided to the Justice Ayo Salami led panel. Okah warned that Magu’s allegation against Malami must not be swept under the carpet. He claimed there were overwhelming evidences of massive corruption against the AGF, adding that he has also been accused of abuse of office. The PDP Youth leader said it’s impossible for Malami to remain in office and not interfere in the assignment given to Justice Salami. “The only way Magu’s allegations can be given a fair view is to have Malami fired by the president”, Okah said. He wondered why the Buhari government that claimed to be fighting graft “is soaked deeply in corrupt activities”. Magu, in a 44-page document tendered to the presidential panel, insisted that the complaints against him were fabricated and meant to tarnish his image and EFCC credibility. Magu was released after 9 days in detention on Wednesday. He was arrested by a combined team of the Department of State Services (DSS) and Police on July 6. Meanwhile, Malami has petitioned the Police over what he called defamatory publications against him.

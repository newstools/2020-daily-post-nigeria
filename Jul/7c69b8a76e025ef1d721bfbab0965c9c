The Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, on Wednesday, said that the West Africa Examination Council, WAEC, timetable is not determined by Nigeria. The PTF Coordinator, Dr. Sani Aliyu, while speaking during an interview on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily, stated that the Federal Government will not want a spill-over in the nation’s academic calendar which will end up affecting graduating students. According to him, this is the main reason why schools will be reopened nationwide for graduating students with immediate effect. He said “We already have a large number of students that are in their exit year and they really need to move on. “We have exams that are not specific only to Nigeria but in West Africa, WAEC for instance. “So, we need to find a way to safely get these students to do their exams and exit, otherwise we will have a serious spill-over when it comes to education. “COVID19 will go away eventually even though we don’t know when but It may take a year or longer, and what we don’t want is for it to have such a significant impact on our educational program where children are unable to move at home where there is no mobility.” Recall that the PTF Chairman, Boss Mustapha, had on Monday, said that schools will be reopened nationwide for graduating students with immediate effect. He explained that the measure was to allow the graduating classes prepare for their final examinations.

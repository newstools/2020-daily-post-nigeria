Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has given reasons why they were able to defeat Liverpool 4-0 on Thursday. Guardiola, speaking to the media after the match, said they had to take “risks” because of the Reds’ high pressing style. “We tried to play football, taking risks. “Because they are the best team I ever faced in my life with high pressing, it is incredible how fast they are, how quick they play,” he said. Kevin De Bruyne put City one goal up after Joe Gomez dragged Raheem Sterling down inside the box. Sterling himself made it 2-0 with a scruffed effort before Phil Foden finished off a fine move. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain then diverted Sterling’s shot into his next, as Liverpool were humiliated at The Etihad, exactly one week after becoming the new champions of England.

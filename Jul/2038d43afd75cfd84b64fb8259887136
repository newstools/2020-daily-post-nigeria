Activist lawyer, Femi Falana (SAN), has denied being a member of a pressure group named Nigerian Consultative Forum (NCF) recently formed. About 30 prominent Nigerians including Oby Ezekwesili, Pat Utomi were earlier listed as members of the new political coalition. Falana gave this clarification in a statement in Lagos on Friday titled: “I am not involved in NCF” said he was not informed as one of the pillars of NCF. He said he would inform Nigerians at the appropriate time of a new platform which would be predicated upon pro-masses oriented anti-poverty programme. He, however, commended the genuine motive of NCF, adding that some of the promoters of the NCF are people who are motivated by the common good and have made sacrifices to make Nigeria a better place. His statement read in part: “I commend what appears to be the genuine motive of the organisers of the National Consultative Forum. “However, I observe that my name has been mentioned as one of the pillars behind this initiative. “I wish to say that at no time have I been consulted neither did I attend the meeting where the forum was launched. “I appreciate the almost desperate situation progressive Nigerians find themselves in the bid to save Nigeria from what looks like an imminent shipwreck.” Falana noted that his clarification does not depict opposition to NCF. “At the appropriate time, we shall inform Nigerians to present the new platform which would be predicated upon pro-masses oriented anti-poverty programme, and hopefully, the founders of the new initiative will be proud not to be left out.”

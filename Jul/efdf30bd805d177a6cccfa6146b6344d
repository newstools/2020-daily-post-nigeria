Manchester United legend, Paul Scholes, has insisted that the Red Devils are in top 10 on the Premier League table because of goalkeeper, David de Gea. Scholes said this while hitting out at De Gea’s critics following the Spaniard’s latest mistake against Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final on Sunday. DAILY POST had reported that De Gea came under fire after an awful display in Man United’s FA Cup semi-final 3-1 defeat to Chelsea. A former England striker, Alan Shearer, urged Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, that the time has come for goalkeeper, Dean Henderson, to replace De Gea as the club’s no.1 shot-stopper. But despite his recent errors, De Gea was backed by Solskjaer after the defeat to Chelsea. Reacting to the development ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash with West Ham United on Wednesday, Scholes agrees with Solskjaer and claims Man United would not have finished in the top half of the Premier League table in the last six seasons if not for the 29-year-old keeper. “Yep, he’s having a bad time, but without him, United wouldn’t have finished in the top 10 in the last six years,” Scholes wrote on Instagram. “He’ll be back!”

Atletico Madrid have rejected an offer from Arsenal to sign their midfielder, Thomas Partey after the Gunners offered Matteo Guendouzi plus £22.5million in a swap deal for the Ghanaian international. According to Get French Football News, Atletico Madrid are believed to have reiterated to Arsenal that they want Partey’s £45.6million release clause to be paid out in full. Partey had drawn the interest of Arsenal in recent weeks as their manager, Mikel Arteta looks to make his first signing of the summer. Guendouzi, on the other hand, has been frozen out at the Emirates. The 21-year-old is Arsenal’s main make-weight in any potential deal with Arteta having few assets to use. Partey’s current contract at Atletico Madrid will expire in 2023. The 27-year-old had said in the summer of 2018 that he was hopeful of playing in the English Premier League, one day. “The Premier League is good. It is very competitive and has some of the best players in the world. “Hopefully, one day. I want to play there,” Partey said.

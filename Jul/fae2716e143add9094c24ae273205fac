The suspended Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, has written to the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to be released on bail. In a letter dated July 10, 2020, Magu’s legal representative, Oluwatosin Ojaomo, asked Adamu to grant bail to his client on “self recognizance”. Magu was arrested on Monday and taken to the presidential villa in Abuja, where he was interrogated by an Ayo Salami-led panel headed by Ayo Salami, a retired president of the Appeal Court. He has been in detention since Monday night, answering questions on embezzled recovered loot and selling of seized assets to associates. President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, approved Magu’s suspension as acting chairman of EFCC. The agency’s Director of Operations, Mohammed Umar, will take charge and oversee the activities of the Commission pending the conclusion of the ongoing investigation.

Eunice Ortom, wife of the Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has tested positive for COVID-19. Mrs. Ortom in a statement on Friday confirmed that her son and some of her staff also tested positive. She said she has since gone into total isolation and has urged people who had contact with her in the last two weeks to get tested for the disease. “A few moments ago this evening, I received my result from the tests earlier carried out on me by NCDC personnel on routine screening at the Government House, Makurdi which returned positive. I, my son, and some staff are COVID-19 positive. “We have from this moment, gone into total isolation as required by the NCDC protocol and would immediately begin the management and treatment as advised by medical experts,” she added. The governor’s wife stressed that COVID-19 is not a death sentence, adding that everyone should be responsible for their actions to keep others safe.

There was panic on Saturday afternoon at the Onitsha Army Baracks as a Volkswagen Golf car reportedly went up in flames at the gate of the barracks. An eyewitness said the panic was mostly from traders who sell wares by the roadside close to the gate of the barracks as it was thought to be an attack on the military. The eyewitness, who identified himself as Mr. Innocent said, “I was inside a vehicle in front of the golf car, while going to Onitsha, and suddenly, the driver just drove close to the area and jumped out, while fire engulfed the car. “Everyone was confused and started running, but later the fire was put off by some people in the area,” he said. Meanwhile, the state command of the Federal Road Safety Corps, through its PRO, Mr Pascal Anigbo confirmed the incident, but attributed it to an electrical fault in the vehicle. “Today, Saturday, July 4, 2020, a blue coloured Volkswagen Golf with registration number FU935LND reportedly went up in flames, near Army Gate Onitsha, along Onitsha-Awka expressway. “The fire, which was reported to have been caused by some mechanical faults in the vehicle, was arrested by operatives of Anambra State Fire Service. No injury and no death recorded. The driver who was the only victim is yet to be identified. “FRSC personnel from Upper-Iweka Outpost have cordoned off the area and diverted traffic to ensure free flow and other traffic management,” he said.

Prof. Charles Ayo, Vice- Chancellor, Trinity University, has said there will be consequences if Nigerian students failed to participate in the 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). The ex-Vice-Chancellor of Covenant University, spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday. The don said that the non-participation of students in the 2020 WASSCE would affect the admission of students into tertiary institutions. He, however, admitted that there was wisdom in the government’s decision. Ayo noted that the outbreak of COVID-19 is better imagined than experienced. “It is obvious that there be a delay in having the examination and not outright cancellation. It is better for the federal government to thread on the part of caution than to allow our students to fall victims of the disease,” he said. The VC urged the federal government to intensify efforts in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic so that students could resume. He told authorities to ensure compliance of precautionary measures to further curb the spread of coronavirus.

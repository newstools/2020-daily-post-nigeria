The Speaker of the Imo State House of Assembly, Chiji Collins, has been accused of sidelining the opposition members of the House in the scheme of things while protecting the interest of colleagues from the ruling All Progressives Congress. The member representing Oguta State constituency, Frank Egbuoma laid this claim while on a phone-in program on Ozisa FM, Owerri today. Egbuoma said that the speaker arrogates too much power to himself that he takes charge of everything in the House. “He has been functioning as the chairman of all the committees and has not held leadership meeting for one year. The speaker has committed so many impeachable offenses. Take for instance, the use of a single microphone at plenaries leaves much to be desired. “If the speaker had allowed the various committees to function without let or hindrances, the committee in charge of the functionality of the House would have been held responsible for the recent invasion of coronavirus that got so many members infected. This is height of incompetence,” he said. On the rumour making the rounds that the speaker has been on the move to instigate the salary cut of members of the PDP, he confirmed it as true, describing him as a true definition of what a speaker should not be. Similarly, it was alleged that twenty-two out of twenty-seven members of the Assembly are seriously plotting for the speaker’s impeachment. Our correspondent who spoke with the Special Adviser to the speaker, Emeka Ahaneku, reported that the purported moved was without basis as, according to him, “They lack the powers to impeach the speaker.”

The federal government on Thursday restated that it had not directed schools to reopen. Secretary to the Government of the federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha, said this at a media briefing on Thursday. The administration had been criticised by stakeholders over reports that authorities were set to reopen schools. The Colleges Of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) issued stern warnings. Mustapha, Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on the COVID-19, announced that the Federal Ministry of Education would consult more widely. He said: “For the avoidance of doubts, schools have not resumed. Only critical examination classes will be allowed to resume for those who need revision before examinations.” The official added that the Ministry of Education “will consult further with stakeholders before issuing guidelines that will lead to full resumption”. The SGF appealed to Nigerians “to continue to show understanding and to ensure that their wards take full advantage of electronic platforms provided for learning”.

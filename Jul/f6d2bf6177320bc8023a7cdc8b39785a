The Defence Headquarters has said that the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation Lafiya Dole, on Friday, killed several Boko Haram terrorists in airstrikes at Mina along the Gulumba Gana-Kumshe axis in Northern Borno. Major Gen. John Enenche, the Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, in a statement on Saturday, disclosed that the airstrikes also destroyed Boko Haram’s logistics supplies at the location. Enenche explained that the operation was executed after intelligence reports showed that the terrorists’ location had recently been reinforced with fighters and logistics supplies. He said: “Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets that engaged the location scored accurate hits in their bombing runs, neutralizing some of the terrorists and destroying some of their structures, including one of the terrorists’ logistics’ huts which were seen engulfed in flames. “Some of the terrorists who escaped the bomb attacks were mopped as the jets strafed their hiding positions.”

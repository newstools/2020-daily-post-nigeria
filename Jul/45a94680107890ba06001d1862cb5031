A Kano High Court has nullified the election of a House of Assembly Member of APC platform, Magaji Dahiru Zarewa. With this development, the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) gained an additional seat in the Kano State House of Assembly. The Court in Kano on Friday sacked Magaji Dahiru Zarewa of the APC and declared Jibril Isma’il Falgore of the PDP as the elected member, representing Rogo Federal Constituency. The court said Mr Zarewa failed to resign from his position as the Managing Director of the Kano Drugs and Consumables Supply Agency 30 days to the election. It, therefore, directed the state Assembly clerk to immediately swear-in Mr Falgore as the legitimate member for Rogo constituency. With this ruling, PDP now has 13 members while the ruling APC has 27 members in the Kano state House of Assembly.

Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, personally monitored the observance of COVID-19 protocols at the burial of his mother-in-law, Florence Mopelola Adenekan. She was laid to rest at Isara, in Remo North local government area of Ogun State, on Friday. Mrs Adenekan, who died just days to her 90th birthday, was the mother of Mrs Bola Obasanjo. However, Bola was absent at the ceremony. She has been in the United Kingdom.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-815376" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20200710-WA0052.jpg" alt="" width="1008" height="567" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20200710-WA0052.jpg 1008w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20200710-WA0052-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px">At the St. Peter’s Anglican Church, Diocese of Remo, venue of the Order of Service, Obasanjo ensured that the approved limit of those to be allowed was adhered to. He personally shut the church doors as the Archibishop of Lagos Ecclesiastical Province of Lagos/Bishop of Remo Diocese, Most Rev Dr M.O Fape, presided. Some of his close aides and associates were locked out despite having their face masks on. Shortly after the burial service, the interment took place at the Church cemetery located behind the church, with Obasanjo leading family members to pay the dust to dust rites. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-815377" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20200710-WA0049.jpg" alt="" width="1008" height="567" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20200710-WA0049.jpg 1008w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20200710-WA0049-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px"> The former President later paid homage to the four traditional rulers at Ode and Isara areas of the local government. He visited Oba Mukaila Akanbi Olabinjo (Isara); the Iraye Remo, Oba Samuel Olatunji Kalejaiye; the Eleposo Eposo Ode Remo, Oba Albert Adebose Mayungbe; and the Alaye Ode, Oba (Suvr.) Adetunji Osho. Oba Osho said Obasanjo’s visit, despite being on personal engagement, demonstrated he is a true Yoruba son. “We shall continue to learn from your wisdom. The entire people of Ode is proud and appreciate these visits,” the traditional leader said. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-815378" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20200710-WA0051.jpg" alt="" width="1008" height="567" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20200710-WA0051.jpg 1008w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG-20200710-WA0051-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px">

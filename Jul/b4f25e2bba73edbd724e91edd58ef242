ASA, a football club in Brazil, abandoned its long-awaited return to training on Sunday. This followed the discovery that most of their boots had been stolen from the stadium, Reuters reports. The 21 pairs of boots worth total of 7,000 reais (1,300 dollars) went missing from the club in Alagoas state. Emanuel Cerquera, Director of Football, confirmed the development. “Training was suspended because the team isn’t able to get back to work due to this embarrassing situation,” he told the club’s website. He said ASA has financial problems, “and then something like this happens. I ask for the author of this crime to have some sympathy with ASA’s situation.” The club is prominent in the Alagoas league, having won the state title six times since 2000. The players were expecting to restart training after a long break caused by coronavirus.

Mr Paul Ibe, the senior special adviser to the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the 2019 general election, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has said that Godswill Akpabio, the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, lied when he denied saying that the National Assembly received 60 percent of Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, contracts. While answering questions at the ongoing probe of the NDDC by the House of Representatives committee, Akpabio had linked contracts awarded by the Commission to members of the National Assembly, saying that the majority of the contracts awarded were handled by the lawmakers. According to Akpabio: “Most of the contracts at NDDC are handled by members of the National Assembly. “Most of the contracts in NDDC are given out to the members of the National Assembly. If you don’t know, please ask the two chairmen.” But in a letter read on the floor of the House of Representatives during plenary by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila on Thursday, Akpabio denied accusing members of the National Assembly of collecting 60 percent of the contracts awarded by the NDDC. Reacting to the development, Ibe wrote on Twitter, “Akpabio has done a 360° somersault by denying that no 9th NASS member received any contract from @NDDCOnline.” He shared a video proving the former lawmaker actual made the comments, adding, “This video confirms he’s lying. He’s obliged to name lawmakers from previous NASS who received 60% of the NDDC contracts as claimed on live television.” Video… VIDEO FACT CHECK: Akpabio has done a 360° somersault by denying that no 9th NASS member received any contract from @NDDCOnline.

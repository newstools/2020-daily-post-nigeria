Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, has set a new record after he added $13 billion to his net worth on Monday. According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, it is the largest single-day jump for an individual since 2012. Bezos has now seen his fortune increase from $74 billion in 2020 to $189.3 billion, despite the United States entering its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. He is now personally worth more than the market valuation of giants such as Exxon Mobil Corp., Nike Inc. and McDonaldâ€™s Corp. Meanwhile, Mackenzie Bezos, his ex-wife, gained $4.6 billion Monday and is now the 13th-richest person in the world, while Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer, Mark Zuckerberg has added almost $15 billion to his net worth so far this year. DAILY POST had reported that Bezos overtook owner of Microsoft, Bill Gates, to become the wealthiest person alive last month. His previous record was set in 2018, before his divorce from wife Mackenzie Bezos.

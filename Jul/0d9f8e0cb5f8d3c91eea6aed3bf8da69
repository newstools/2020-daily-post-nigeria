Emir of Fika and Chairman Yobe State Council of Chiefs Dr. Muhammad Ibn Abali Muhammadu Idrissa has appealed to the government to come up with stiffer penalties against indiscriminate cutting down of trees for domestic use. The Monarch made the appeal on Saturday while receiving the Yobe State Commissioner of Environment, Sidi Yakubu Karasuwa during advocacy and sensitization on tree planting and preservation of the environment. The traditional ruler said the visit by the Commissioner and his team to the palace was timely considering the recent windstorm that blew up house roofings and destroyed property across the state. “We want a law to prevent unnecessary felling down of trees, it has serious effects on our environment, people use the trees as sources of firewood for cooking. “We will continue to enlighten people to change habits for the betterment and safety of our environment”, he pledged. Earlier speaking, the State Commissioner of Environment, Sidi Yakubu Karasuwa revealed that they were at the Palace on the directives of the Yobe State Governor, Maimala Buni to pass the message on environmental preservation for the future use. He commended the emir for his untiring efforts in stopping the destruction of the environment in his domain. “This year, we have set aside 3 million tree seedlings ready for transplant across the state. “The Governor is disturbed with the hazards of the environment especially the reported indices of the environmental consequences. There has been unnecessary cutting down of trees for domestic use which is exposing our environment to global warming”, he stated. Karasuwa appealed for the planting of more trees on roadsides, farms and houses pointing out that the seedlings will soon be made available to the people of the State.

The Nigerian government has facilitated the release of thirty-nine Nigerians detained for illegally entering Ghana. The Nigerians in the Diaspora Commission, NIDCOM, disclosed this on its official Twitter page. The Nigerian citizens were arrested at Aflao border as they attempted to enter the country illegally. The statement read in part: “The Nigerian consular team was dispatched by the High Commission to intervene immediately. “On getting there we met with about 30 more Nigerians who were arrested for also trying to enter Ghana through illegal routes due to the border closure.” The consular team, however, appealed to the immigration officials not to prosecute the culprits but allow the easy evacuation of stranded Nigerians. The citizens would be brought back to Nigeria after taking the COVID-19 test in line with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control protocols. The statement read in part: “There are about 50 Nigerians detained by the Ghanaian immigration authorities because some were moved away from the Aflao border and kept somewhere else. “As soon as the COVID-19 test is done they will return with the next set of returnees. “However, it should be noted that 11 of the detainees have escaped, according to Ghanaian immigration.”

The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) on Wednesday lifted the ban placed on market operations from three to seven days a week, effective from July 30, 2020. The FCT Minister, Malam Muhammad Bello, disclosed this in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Anthony Ogunleye, on Wednesday in Abuja. Bello, however, said that the markets would open from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. The decision was reached at a virtual meeting between members of the FCT COVID-19 Response Team, senior members of the administration and members of the Coalition of FCT Market Chairmen and Secretaries led by its Chairman Mr. Raphael Okorie. The ban was lifted to decongest the markets and to further check the spread of COVID-19. “Access to the markets and operations within the markets will only be permitted with the wearing of face mask and adherence to other guidelines such as hand washing and maintenance of physical distancing.” Bello warned that the FCTA might withdraw this extension should the coalition of FCT Market Chairmen and Secretaries fail to implement the guidelines.

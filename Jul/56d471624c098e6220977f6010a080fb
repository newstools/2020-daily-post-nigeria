The Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio, has now appeared before the House of Representative Committee which is investigating the alleged misappropriation of funds in the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. Recall that the committee had on Friday summoned Akpabio, following allegations levelled against him by the former Managing Director of the NDDC, Joy Nunieh. The House Committee is investigating alleged mismanagement of funds by the current NDDC’s Interim Management Committee (IMC). Nunieh had accused Akpabio of fraud, padding, sexual harassment, among others. However, Akpabio has ordered his lawyer to commence legal actions against Nunieh over the said allegations. The former Governor of Akwa Ibom had State described Nunieh’s claims against him, as “cornucopia of false, malicious and libelous.”

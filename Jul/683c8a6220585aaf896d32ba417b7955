Manchester United gaffer, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has reiterated his belief that his team would finish top four on the Premier League table and qualify for Champions League next season, despite their FA Cup semi-final 3-1 defeat to Chelsea at Wembley Stadium on Sunday. Solskjaer’s men are presently occupying the fifth position on the Premier League table with 62 points after 36 games. The Red Devils could move past Chelsea, who are in the third position on the log if they beat West Ham United on Wednesday and the Blues lose against Liverpool. “We have been great in the last few months, giving ourselves a chance going into the last two games,” Solskjaer told MUTV. “We always said that if we can get into the Leicester game needing to beat them, that would be a great achievement and we might be able to even go one step further than that if we get a good result against West Ham United.” He added: “Of course we cannot do anything about that, but it is between us, Chelsea and Leicester for those two last positions and the more help we get from others, the better, of course. “But if we do our job on Wednesday we will be in a good position. We will go into the Leicester game and hope that if we win that one, we can qualify for the Champions League. “We have just got to regroup and go again on Wednesday against West Ham.”

The Trade Union Congress (TUC) has warned the federal government to reverse the new stamp duties on house rents. TUC in a statement jointly signed by its President, Quadri Olaleye and the Secretary General, Musa-Lawal questioned the timing of the new fiscal measure. According to the new stamp duties released by the Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS) rent between 1-7 years is 0.78%; above 7 to 21 years is 3%; above 21 years is 6%. The Union leaders said while other countries are giving palatives to their citizens, Nigerian government intends to further burden the citizens. “We are calling on the federal government to immediately order the FIRS to stay action if it does not want to incur the wrath of workers and Nigerians. “We read that Ghanaians will not be paying for power throughout this year. Why is our case always different? Why increase our burden now?” The union queried.

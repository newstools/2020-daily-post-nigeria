Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, remains “very interested” in Lille striker, Victor Osimhen, according to L’Equipe. The striker who is valued at around £75m is also being linked with Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea in England. In May this year, Lille reportedly received an offer from Spurs for the 21-year-old striker. Osimhen’s agent, Ariyo Igbayilola, later revealed that the player would not consider a move to White Hart Lane unless Harry Kane left. Although Osimhen has flown to Napoli for talks this week, it is understood Klopp is still in the race to land the Nigerian. Klopp is looking to strengthen his squad ahead of a Premier League title defence next season.

Barcelona president, Josep Bartomeu, has insisted Lionel Messi will not be leaving the club any time soon. There have been recent speculations that Messi could quit at the end of next season. It is believed the 33-year-old is frustrated at the Nou Camp and could take advantage of a clause in his contract to leave. Speaking after a 4-1 win over Villarreal on Sunday, Bartomeu told Movistar: “I’m not going to give details of the negotiations, but he has said many times that he wants to finish his career at Barcelona. “Right now, we are focused on the competition and there are negotiations with lots of players. Messi wants to continue at Barca and he wants to end (his career) here. He has many years left and we’re going to enjoy him for a long time.” Barca’s win moves the champions to within four points of league leaders Real Madrid with four games each left to play.

Barcelona president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, on Friday held crisis talks with manager Quique Setien, ESPN reports. The Catalan side are in a delicate situation after losing their LaLiga crown to Real Madrid. Real clinched their 34th title on Thursday, following a 2-1 win over Villarreal and Barca’s 2-1 home defeat to Osasuna. A day later, Bartomeu met with Setien to assess his state of mind and if he feels strong enough to lead the team through the crisis. Setien is expected to be in the dugout on Sunday, for their last game of the LaLiga campaign against Alaves. Bartomeu wants him to still be in charge, when they welcome Napoli in the second leg of their Champions League last-16 tie on August 8. After the loss to Osasuna, Barca captain Lionel Messi, branded the club “inconsistent” and “weak”, emphasizing the need to “change a lot”. Bartomeu is aware of the tense relationship between the players and Setien, but is hopeful that the five days off the team will have next week after LaLiga is over, will help to decompress the situation.

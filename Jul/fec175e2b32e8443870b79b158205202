Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, has criticised Leicester City defender, Ryan Bennett, for the first goal the Foxes conceived following their 3-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. James Justin’s own goal and Harry Kane’s brace gave Jose Mourinho’s side all three points against Leicester. Neville, speaking on Sky Sports afterwards, slammed Bennett for his poor defending against Spurs. “We see it a lot in the game generally, when you allow a player to cut back inside on his stronger foot, it really does cause the goalkeeper problems, it causes the defence problems,” Neville said. “He is got to keep him going outside, and Ryan Bennett just allows him [Harry Kane] to cut back in, and once he does that you’re in the lap of the gods. “James Justin, who’s followed that really hard run by Harry Kane into the box is in a position where he shouldn’t be, and he deflects it into his own goal. “You’re not going to win the ball back if you are Ryan Bennett against Son running in the box, but what you have to make sure is you show them the way in which it’s easiest for your goalkeeper. “Once you let the player come back inside on their right foot, your goalkeeper has got a nightmare. He’s got to adjust his position, move his feet, the other defenders are panicking. “You have to make sure you almost over-cover and show them on the outside, and it makes it a lot easier than for Kasper Schmeichel or any goalkeeper to close down that angle and just set himself.”

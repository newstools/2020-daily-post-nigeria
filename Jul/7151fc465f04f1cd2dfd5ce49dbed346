The Senior Pastor of Omega Fire Ministries, Apostle Johnson Suleman, has reacted to the killing of some aid workers by Boko Haram terrorists. Apostle Suleman said the latest Boko Haram killing was an indication that the federal government needs to intensify its fight against terrorism. The clergyman who condemned the killing wondered when the government would pay much attention to security. In a tweet on his verified Twitter handle, Apostle Suleman wrote: ”I totally condemn the gruesome killing of the 5 aid workers by Boko Haram. This is dastardly. Watching the clip makes one wonder when security would become priority in our nation. The govt should intensify its fight against these terrorists. May their souls rest in peace.” The insurgents in a footage had confirmed that the deceased were humanitarian staff of a non-governmental organisation. Before shooting the five aid workers, the insurgents had their faces covered and described them as infidels.

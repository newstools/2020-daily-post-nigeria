Award-winning American rapper, Megan Thee Stallion has cleared the air on her alleged arrest which landed her in a hospital on Sunday morning Reports had it that Tory Lanez was arrested by the police following a fight that broke out at a house party in Hollywood Hills on Sunday, July 12. Megan and her best friend Kelsey Nicole were in the car with Tory Lanez when the Canadian rapper was arrested and charged with carrying a concealed weapon in his vehicle. Megan was said to have suffered an injury during the incident and was hospitalized. However, Megan on her Instagram page explained that she actually ‘suffered gunshot wounds’ as a result of the crime and underwent surgery at the hospital to remove the bullets. Her post read: “The narrative being reported about the events on Sunday morning are inaccurate and I would like to set the record straight. “On Sunday morning, I suffered gunshot wounds, as a result of a crime that was committed against me and done with the intention to physically harm me.” Megan, however, said unlike reports she was not arrested as she was the victim of the crime. “I was never arrested, the police officers drove me to the hospital where I underwent surgery to remove the bullets. “I’m incredibly grateful to be alive and that I’m expected to make a full recovery, but it was important for me to clarify the details about this traumatic night.” The ‘Savage’ crooner said she is currently focused on recovery and hopeful to return to making music as soon as possible. “This whole experience was an eye opener and a blessing in disguise. I hate that it took this experience for me to learn how to protect my energy,” she added.

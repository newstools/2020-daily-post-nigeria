The Rwandan police on Thursday arrested four people who had escaped from a COVID-19 treatment center in Eastern province.
The Ngoma district police in a statement said that the patients who contracted the disease and were receiving treatment at the center set up at a secondary school in Ngoma district escaped on Wednesday evening after breaking iron window bars.
According to the statement, it took the efforts of Security officers and local leaders to locate their whereabouts and arrest them following a tip-off from people who saw them.
It also stated that Security officers and medics are tracing their likely contacts, including their families, according to the statement.
The police, however, urged those who could have had contact with the quartet to come forward for tests and due treatment to prevent the spread of the pandemic.
NAN reports that Rwanda on Thursday reported 16 new cases and 13 recoveries, bringing the total confirmed cases to 1,210 and total recoveries to 623. The country so far has recorded three deaths from the virus.

Meanwhile, the outcome of the primaries had been predicted by political observers to be a tight race among the two leading aspirants who are Ajayi, Jegede. The two top aspirants command large support base of PDP members across the three senatorial district of the state. One of them among the six other aspirants will no doubt win the primaries.

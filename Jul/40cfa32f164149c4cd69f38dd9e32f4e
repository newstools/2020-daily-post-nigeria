Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has again called on governor Rotimi Akeredolu to quit from October 20 governorship race and retire to his home in Ibadan. Giwa, while reacting to political developments in the state on Tuesday, said nothing could stop the good people of Ondo State from voting out Akeredolu’s administration. The cleric in a statement to DAILY POST on Tuesday, described Governor Akeredolu as an opportunist who was lured from Ibadan to become the governor in Ondo State. He said, “Don’t forget that it was Asiwaju Bola Tinubu who sold Governor Akeredolu to Ondo State people in 2012 under the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria “Tinubu tried to impose Chief Akeredolu on the people of Ondo state, but they refused because nobody knew him. “Governor Akeredolu has offended the people of Ondo state by increasing tuition fees from N25,000 to N150,000. “Ondo State people cannot also forgive him by not taking steps to resuscitate at least two out of the various moribund industries in the state. “I have advised the governor a long time ago to start packing his bags. His wife, children, in-laws and his Chief of Staff from Owo are those he can only trust as it is. “When God rejected Saul as king of Israel, thousands of his soldiers slipped away. Saul counted those who were with him, he only found six hundred. “When preparation meets opportunity, try to lessen the suffering of others and do what is right in the sight of the Lord.”

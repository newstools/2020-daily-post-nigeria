Former Liverpool defender, Glen Johnson, has predicted the position Chelsea, Leicester City and Manchester United will finish in the Premier League this season. Chelsea is currently in the third position on the Premier League table with one point ahead of fourth place, Leicester City and two points ahead of fifth-place Man United after 35 games. However, Man United will go third position on the log ahead of Chelsea and Leicester if they beat Southampton on Monday night at Old Trafford. But Johnson, who played for Chelsea between 2003 and 2007, believes Frank Lampard’s men and the Red Devils will secure the third and fourth positions ahead of Leicester. When asked which teams will finish in third and fourth position between Chelsea, Man United, and Leicester, Johnson told Daily Mirror: “I think it will be Chelsea and United. “It would have been a different answer if you’d asked me six weeks ago, but I just think United the way they have found some form, they are blowing teams away. “They are probably the hottest team right now, and I know Leicester have got a couple of tough games, and they played United last game so it could boil down to that. “But I think I’d go Chelsea third and United fourth.”

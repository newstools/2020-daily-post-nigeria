Ibrahim Magu, the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has declared that he will no longer hide but was now ready to fight back at orchestrated attacks against his person. Magu said he will henceforth reply to all the allegations against him in public. This was contained in a statement made available to reporters by Wahab Shittu, Magu’s lawyer on Sunday. In the lengthy letter, the ex-EFCC boss also denied relooting funds recovered from the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC. Magu noted that these allegations against him in the public domain were never brought before the Presidential Panel probing the activities of the EFCC under him. Magu said that the over N329 million recovered under his watch by the agency was remitted directly into NNPC dedicated accounts via remita under a special arrangement endorsed by the NNPC, EFCC, and the affected NNPC marketers. He said this can be independently verified both at the NNPC and the EFCC records and that the issue of NNPC recovered funds never featured in the proceedings of the presidential panel. Allegations such as assets declaration and failure by him to properly explain the rationale for the exclusion of culprits in the alleged misapplication of three billion naira in the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) were also dispelled by the suspended acting Chairman. Summing up all the allegations Magu said they were fraudulent and deliberate attempts to malign him.

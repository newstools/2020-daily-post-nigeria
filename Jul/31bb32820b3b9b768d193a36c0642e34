A gay Premier League footballer has admitted he is afraid to come out. In an open letter published by the UK Sun, the player who is not yet ready to reveal his identity, said only some members of his family and a “select group” of friends know about his sexuality. He confirmed that none of his teammates and manager know he is gay, but “dearly hopes” he will be able to tell them “one day soon”. He wrote: “I am gay. Even writing that down in this letter is a big step for me. “How does it feel having to live like this? Day-to-day, it can be an absolute nightmare. And it is affecting my mental health more and more. “I feel trapped and my fear is disclosing the truth about what I am will only make things worse.” The letter was released by the Justin Fashanu Foundation, who are supporting the player.

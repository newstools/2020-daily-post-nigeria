Juventus sporting director, Fabio Paratici, has denied that Cristiano Ronaldo will leave the club this summer. There have been speculations that Ronaldo could seek a move away, after losing confidence in their Champions League prospects. But Paratici told Sky Italia: “Cristiano is super convinced to stay. He is very well with us.” On Paulo Dybala, he added: We are talking about Paulo frequently with his entourage. We are on the same line of finding the best solution for the renewal. “Paulo must stay with us, he is a very important player and he can still give a lot at Juve in the coming years.” Ronaldo netted twice in a 2-1 win over Lazio on Monday night, with the Turin side set to clinch the Serie A title this weekend. With his brace, Ronaldo became the first player to score at least 50 goals in the Premier League, LaLiga and Serie A. Juve has now moved eight points clear of Inter Milan four rounds of fixtures left.

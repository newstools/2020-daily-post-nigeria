Manchester United, Arsenal, Everton and Wolves are involved in a transfer ‘war’ over the signing of Real Madrid attacking midfielder, James Rodríguez, according to MARCA. The Four Premier League clubs have made inquiries about the availability of the Colombian international this summer’s transfer window. Real Madrid wants to sell Rodríguez, who has one year left on his contract, rather than lose him for free next year. Rodriquez is keen to leave Zinedine Zidane’s side this summer to get more regular first-team football. The 28-year-old was among the four players the Los Blancos wanted to leave the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season. Rodriquez who also spent two years on loan at Bayern Munich in the past, was once valued at around £100m by Real Madrid.

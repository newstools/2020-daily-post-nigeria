Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool are set to benefit from Manchester City’s £9million (€10m) UEFA fine, following the Court of Arbitration’s (CAS) ruling on Monday. UEFA had banned City from European football for two years following alleged breaches to Financial Fair Play (FFP). Following this historic victory, the ban will no longer be imposed while the €30m fine has been reduced to €10m (£9m). According to the UEFA ruling, this money will now be shared out among clubs in the Champions League and Europa League competitions, who have adhered to all rules set out. This means the likes of Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea will receive small monetary boosts as a result. This mirrors a situation from six years ago, in which City was fined £50m by UEFA for the FFP breaches, but was informed they would only pay around £20m if they went on to comply with the break-even rules in future seasons. In 2014, the first tranche of payments from City, along with Paris Saint-Germain and Zenit St Petersburg who was also found guilty of breaking the rules totalled £20m and was also split among the Champions League and Europa League clubs.

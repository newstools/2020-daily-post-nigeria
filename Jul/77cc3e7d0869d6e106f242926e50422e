A forty-one-year-old man, Effiom Etowa, who allegedly defiled his 3-year old daughter, was remanded in the custody of Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, by an Ibadan Chief Magistrates’ Court on Friday. Etowa, who lives in Tinuoye Estate, Ojoo, in Ibadan, is standing trial on a count charge of defilement. Chief Magistrate Taiwo Oladiran, who did not take the plea of Etowa, ordered that he should be remanded in NSCDC custody in Ibadan. Oladiran said, “Etowa cannot be admitted at the Correctional Centre, Agodi, Ibadan, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “Etowa is hereby remanded at the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps Headquarter, Ibadan, pending an advice from the Oyo State Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP).” Oladiran, however, adjourned the case until 16 July for hearing. Earlier, ASP Sunday Ogunremi, the Prosecution Counsel, told the court that Etowa committed the offence on 15 June at Ibadan. According to Ogunremi, the offence contravened the provisions of Section 387 Criminal Law of Oyo State, 2000.

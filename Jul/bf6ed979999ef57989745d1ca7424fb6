Chelsea have tabled an offer for Barcelona goalkeeper, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, according to Cadena Ser. Blues boss, Frank Lampard, is looking to address his goalkeeping issues this summer. Chelsea are believed to be ready to cut their losses with Kepa Arrizabalaga, despite making him the most expensive goalkeeper in football history in August 2018. The Stamford Bridge outfit paid £72million to Athletic Bilbao for Kepa, eclipsing the £67m Liverpool paid for Alisson Becker just a month prior. Kepa signed a mammoth seven-year deal, but now fears he has played his final game for the club. However, the Premier League side will face fierce competition from Bayern Munich, who are desperate to bring Ter Stegen back to his homeland, as a long term replacement for Manuel Neuer. Other major European clubs are also keen and are monitoring the situation at the Nou Camp with Ter Stegen’s contract quickly running out. The 28-year-old is yet to reach an agreement with Barca over an extension, although he is understood to be settled in Spain with his family.

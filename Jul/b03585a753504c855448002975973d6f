Former Liverpool defender, Stephen Warnock, has urged Jurgen Klopp to sign Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for the club. Klopp has previously worked with the Arsenal captain when he was at Borussia Dortmund. Having led the Reds to their first-ever Premier League title, the German is already to reinforce his squad ahead of next season. Aubameyang is in the final year of his contract with Arsenal and is still negotiating over an extension. The Gabon striker, who has scored 20 goals this campaign, could be sold this summer or leave as a free agent next year and Klopp has been advised to make a move. Warnock told BBC Radio 5 Live: “If I was Jurgen Klopp, I’d be going for him with a year left on his contract. “He will challenge the front three, he doesn’t need time to settle, you know he’s proven, he knows the manager and the manager knows what he’s about.”

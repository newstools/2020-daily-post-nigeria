The senator representing Borno south, Ali Ndume, has kicked against the reintegration of former Boko Haram fighters into the society. At least 600 former insurgents completed a de-radicalisation, rehabilitation and reintegration (DRR) programme in July this year. But during an interview on BBC Hausa, Ndume warned the government to stop rehabilitating them, because they will never repent. “This government’s programme is unacceptable to our people. The right thing is to stop it, forthwith. “They are like Kharajites. Many among those released have since run away. They will never repent. “The government should know what to do about them. But not re-introducing someone to you, who has killed your parent, or your relations,” Ndume said. The military had in 2016 launched Operation Safe Corridor, an initiative for the deradicalisation and rehabilitation of ex-Boko Haram fighters, with the aim of reintegrating repentant Boko Haram members into society.

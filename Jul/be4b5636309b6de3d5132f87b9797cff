Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, was left fuming after his side lost 3-0 against Sheffield United on Saturday night. Lampard blamed the defeat on lack of chances created and problems made by his players. Two goals from David McGoldrick and a strike from Oli McBurnie ensured Sheffield defeated Chelsea at Bramall Lane. “They play in a certain way, a unique one,” Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying after the match. “But if you play in a slow way and not compete in the way you should do, then you can’t expect to match them. “We didn’t create enough. There were problems in our game.” Chelsea’s next match is against Norwich City on Tuesday.

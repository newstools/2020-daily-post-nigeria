The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State has warned that no governorship aspirant can dictate the mode of the party’s July 20 governorship primary in the state. APC said this in a statement by Mr Alex Kalejaiye, the state’s Publicity Secretary, in Akure on Sunday. “The attention of the Ondo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been drawn to an aggressive agitation for a mode of primary ahead of the governorship election in October 2020,” the statement read in part. “We wish to place it on record that it’s inconceivable that aspirants would dictate to the party on which mode to adopt. “For the sake of emphasis, APC’s constitution approves three modes of primaries to select its candidates for an election: direct, indirect and consensus. “Any of these could be chosen at random, depending on the discretion of the supervising authority. “The supervising authority in this regard is Governor Mai- Mala Bunni-led Caretaker Committee, and saddled with the responsibility to decide the option for Ondo State 2020.” DAILY POST recalls that APC had on Friday said there are no divisions among the party members in Ondo State irrespective of insinuations and conjectures.

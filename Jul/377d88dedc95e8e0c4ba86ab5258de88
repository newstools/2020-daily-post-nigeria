The draws for the delayed quarter-finals and semi-finals of this year’s Champions League were conducted on Friday. Like almost every other sporting competition around the globe, Europe’s top tier club competition was put on hold, as the world grappled with the effects of COVID-19. However, in August, Champions League football returns. Interestingly, from the draws conducted today, only one out of Bayern Munich, Barcelona, Manchester City, Juventus and Real Madrid can play in the final. City is 2-1 up from their first leg against Real and hosts the second leg at the Etihad. Whoever wins the tie, will take on either Lyon or Juventus. That game ended 1-1 in the first leg. Whatever happens only one of Juventus, Man City or Real will make it to the semis, where they will face Bayern Munich or Barcelona. The other side of the draw seems to favour Paris Saint-Germain and Atletico Madrid, either of whom may make it to the final.

Arsenal midfielder, Granit Xhaka, has questioned his team-mates’ mentality following their 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Tuesday night. Trezeguet netted the winner for the hosts in the first half. The Gunners failed to record a single shot on target in their penultimate league fixture. The result implies Mikel Artete’s side can only qualify for next season’s Europa League by winning the FA Cup final against Chelsea on August 1. “In my opinion you can’t come here and play like this. It’s not good enough and you can’t play with this mentality. “It was not enough to take something from (the game) and we knew if we won and then won the last game as well we could have got into the Europa League. “But now we have to win the FA Cup and we have more pressure. But we will do everything to win the FA Cup now. “I think it was Aston Villa, their fight, they put everything out in each half and in my opinion they deserved the three points,” Xhaka told the club’s official website.

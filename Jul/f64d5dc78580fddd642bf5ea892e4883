Manchester United have signed at least six new players, the UK Mirror reports. The Red Devils are being linked with big names like Jadon Sancho and Jack Grealish, as they look to bolster their first-team squad. However, there is one eye on the future and four deals have already been sealed, to strengthen their youth ranks. Sunderland duo Logan Pye and Joe Hugill have put pen to paper with United, while goalkeeper Radek Vitek will also join the U-18s from Sigma Olomouc. Three more players are poised to join them with international clearance the only obstacle left. The club has landed former Liverpool and Everton trialist Isak Hansen-Aaroens last year when he was just 14 years. He will be able to join United on his 16th birthday in August. They are also reported to have agreed on deals with Barcelona and Real Madrid youngsters Marc Jurado and Alvaro Fernandez.

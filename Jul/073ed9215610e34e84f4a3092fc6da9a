Members of the Peoples Democratic Party in Jigawa State have rejected the appointment of 135 local government caretakers committee members by the state caretakers committee. The Gubernatorial Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP in the 2019 general election, Aminu Ibrahim Ringim disclosed this while briefing newsmen in Dutse the state capital. He said they had lost confidence in the state caretakers committee assigned to intervene in the crisis between two factions and bring in the party’s new executive. DAILY POST reported that the National Working Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party PDP had constituted state caretaker committees headed by RT. Hon. Umar Mungadi following the expiration of the executive tenure and to solve the party internal crises between two factions, that of former Governor of the state, Alhaji Sule Lamido
and Gubernatorial candidate in the last general election Aminu Ibrahim Ringim. The factions, however, accused the state caretaker committee members of conniving with Sule Lamido’s faction to approve the appointment of 135 local government committee members without considering the other faction. “We just saw it over the media that the state caretakers committee had appointed local government caretaker committees across the 27 local governments, five-persons from each local government” he noted. “Unfortunately our faction did not consent, we were not asked to give our representatives and there is no single person that represents us in the local government caretakers committees across the 27 local governments” “We, therefore, lost confidence in the state committee because they do not intend to put the house in order” The Gubernatorial candidate, therefore, urged the party National headquarters to change the state caretakers committee for the success of the party.

Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has described the death of Isa Funtua as a rude shock. He also said it was a severe blow to the media industry in Nigeria. Funtua, President Muhammadu Buhari’s ally, died Monday night. On Tuesday, Mohammed hailed his “contribution to media development and his untiring defence for free speech and the freedom of the press”. He said this started when Funtua founded the Democrat Newspapers and later President of the Newspaper Proprietors’ Association of Nigeria (NPAN). The minister added that Funtua’s passion for the media industry saw him serving as the life patron of the NPAN and taking active interest in matters concerning the industry until his death. “Mallam Isa Funtua was a man of many parts, with his eventful life highlighted by service, whether as a media icon, an entrepreneur or a philanthropist,” he said. Mohammed extended his condolences to the President, family, friends and others. He prayed for the repose of his soul.

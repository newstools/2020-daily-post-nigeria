The All Progressives Congress in Imo State led by Marcellus Nlemigbo has raised alarm over plots to unseat Senator Hope Uzodinma as the Governor. In a statement issued by the party’s Director-General, New Media, Cajetan Duke, the APC alleged that two former Governors of the state, Rochas Okorocha and Emeka Ihedioha have aligned forces to unseat Senator Hope Uzodinma, using Uche Nwosu as a pawn to contest the authenticity of Uzodinma’s candidacy in APC during the 2019 governorship election. The statement said that Uche Nwosu who eventually emerged the governorship candidate of Action Alliance in the state had instituted a legal action against the Governor on the grounds that he (Uche Nwosu) was the validly nominated 2019 governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress in the state. The DG said, “it is laughable that Nwosu kept the media space awash with claims of dissociating himself from the dead-on-arrival suit filed on behalf of Ihedioha by Kingdom Okere, the ghost candidate of RAP. “That Uche Nwosu went ahead to sue for peace and pledged his support to the government of Governor Hope Uzodinma is, to say the least, a play to the gallery. “We are not surprised that Uche Nwosu has taken after his father-in-law who cannot honour their words and are not worthy to hold the mandate of the people.” The APC spokesman said Nwosu is fighting a lost battle, expressing surprise that two sworn political enemies, Okorocha and Ihedioha have come together because of some political interest. Recall that the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Monday, July 20, 2020, adjourned to September 29, 2020, a suit filed by Kingdom Okere of RAP, seeking judicial interpretation to ascertain if the APC sponsored Senator Hope Uzodinma as its governorship candidate in 2019 election. DAILY POST, however, learned that the AA candidate, Uche Nwosu has earlier made a statement denying his alleged involvement in the said alliance with the former Governors to oust Hope Uzodinma.

At least, four top officials in the deputy governor’s office in Kwara State have been infected with the deadly coronavirus disease. Warning the people of the state to always adhere strictly with the safety protocols on the disease, the deputy governor, Mr Kayode Alabi, called on Kwarans “to take responsibility in the fight against COVID-19.” In a statement by the Press Secretary in Ilorin on Sunday, Modupe Joel, the deputy governor said, “The only antidote against COVID-19, is to obey all government and health officials precautionary measures. These he explained, included wearing of face masks, avoidance of large gatherings, adherence to physical distancing, washing of hands with soap and running water or sanitizers among others.” Alabi also advised all ministries, departments, and agencies to emulate his action by testing staff of their respective organisations. He described the pandemic, “as real and that which presents danger and requires caution.” The deputy governor assured the people that, “the government is determined to flatten the curve of coronavirus and curb community transmission,” the statement added. DAILY POST reports that just a few hours ago, the state government announced 71 new cases of COVID-19 in the state. Although, there is a frightening spike in the number of infected citizens, only 12 deaths have so far been recorded in the state. The early release of results of the cases may not be unconnected with the new equipment just procured and put to use by the state government, and approved by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC.

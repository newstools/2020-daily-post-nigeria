Bayer Leverkusen director, Rudi Voller, has made it clear Kai Havertz will not leave the club before their Europe League quest is over next month. Havertz is Chelsea’s top target this summer, as Frank Lampard looks to add to the arrivals of Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner. However, with Leverkusen taking a 3-1 lead into their Europa League last-16 second-leg against Rangers on August 6, Voller insists the 21-year-old will be available for selection. When asked whether Havertz would be with the squad, Voller told Kicker: “It is set in stone. There is no new stance.” Voller also stated that Chelsea would have to pay full value for Havertz, as “there will be no ‘corona bonus’.” While Havertz’s valuation is set at around £90m, the Blues are hopeful they can lower that asking price to around £70m in the coming weeks.

Women farmers in Bauchi State, under the aegis of Small Scale Women Farmers of Nigeria (SWOFON), have decried the non-availability of agricultural inputs to boost their farming activities. This was contained in a press release signed and made available to DAILY POST by the coordinator SWOFON, Mrs Makka Abbas. She said unlike their counterparts in some states, women farmers in the state did not get agricultural inputs from the state government to support them this year. “Our members in Gombe, Jigawa and Kano States got seven cartons of herbicides for rice and maize each and their members are registered in agricultural food and job plan projects,” Mrs Abbas stated. According to her, N3.5 million was allocated to Gombe State small scale women farmers in the state for this year’s agriculture budget and lamented that women farmers are left behind in the Bauchi State budget. She further lamented that the groundnut oil factory allocated to small scale women farmers by the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) to support smallholder women farmers in Darazo Local Government Area of the state is yet to commence operation. The SWOFON state coordinator urged NDE to expedite action to commission the factory for it to start working to enable women who farm groundnuts to process them and market their products to maximize profits.

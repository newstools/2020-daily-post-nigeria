A group under the aegis of Concerned Niger Delta Youths on Thursday called on President Muhammadu Buhari to set up a panel to investigate and persecute any criminal in the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. The group made the call during a rally at the Effurun round-about in Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State. The convener of the group, Comrade Israel Joe who spoke about the rot in the NDDC, insisted that the president set a panel of Inquiry to investigate, arrest and prosecute everyone that has been indicted or involved in the NDDC scam. Joe decried the way Niger Delta leaders have turned the commission into an Automated Teller Machine, ATM with different passwords in forms of contracts and inflation of ghost projects. The group which gathered a large crowd also sought the intervention of foreign bodies in the forensic audit just as it urged the Federal Government to ensure the National Assembly members implicated are prosecuted. Comrade Kelvin Ejumudo also said the careless spendings in the NDDC has led to underdevelopment in both human and infrastructure development in the region. Ejumudo said healthcare, education and other sectors suffer because of the looting in the commission.

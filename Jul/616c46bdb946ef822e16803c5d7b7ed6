Atletico Madrid gaffer, Diego Simeone, has insisted that Real Madrid get more penalties from referees than other teams because the Los Blancos are on the attack more often. Simeone said this ahead of Atletico Madrid’s La Liga clash with Celta Vigo on Tuesday. Recall that Barcelona defender, Gerard Pique and club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, have suggested Real Madrid are benefiting from favourable decisions from referees. But Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane on Sunday said he was ‘tired’ of hearing such comments after his team beat Athletic Bilbao 1-0 on Sunday, thanks to captain, Sergio Ramos’ penalty goal. “VAR exposes everything. Before we did not have the possibility of seeing some things that we now see. The referees are people who can be wrong as well,” Simeone was quoted by Goal as saying. “It’s fairer. If they give you more penalties, it is because you are in the opposition’s area more. If they attack more, like Real Madrid, it means you are there longer. “In the speed of the game it is difficult to see what happens, but now another referee sees it with calmness on television — people too, from their homes. “Then there is a person who decides, which is the VAR. It can hurt you or help you, but now we are all clear on if it is offside if it is a penalty, we are all more exposed.”

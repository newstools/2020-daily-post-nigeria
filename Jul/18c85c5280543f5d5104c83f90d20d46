Secretary to the Benue State Government, SSG, Tony Ijohor has recovered from the deadly coronavirus. Governor Samuel Ortom had earlier in July announced that Secretary to the State Government, Ijohor and his Chief of Staff, Terwase Orbunde tested positive for COVID-19. However, Ijohor in a statement he personally signed and made available to newsmen on Friday, said he has recovered from the virus. He said, “It is with praise and thanksgiving to God Almighty that I announce that after subsequent tests, NCDC has declared that I am COVID-19 negative. “I return all glory to God Almighty for His mercy. I also appreciate my wife and my entire family for their support during the time I was in isolation.” He also appreciated Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, his Deputy, Engineer Benson Abounu and the entire State Executive Council for their concern, prayers and support. “The COVID-19 team has been wonderful. “ I join thousands of other well-wishers in prayers for Benue’s First Lady, Dr. Mrs. Eunice Ortom, the Head of Service, Mrs Veronica Onyeke and others. We are optimistic that they will all come out negative and remain hale and hearty,” the SSG added.

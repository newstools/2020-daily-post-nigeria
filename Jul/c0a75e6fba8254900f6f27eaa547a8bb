Kanye West has reportedly dropped out of the U.S. presidential race less than two weeks after announcing his intention to run for president. DAILY POST had reported that the renowned rapper had announced that he has joined the race for the 2020 US presidential election. However, New York Magazine’s Intelligencer, reports that Steve Kramer, an election strategist hired by West to focus on getting his name on the ballot in Florida and South Carolina, said ‘he’s out’ of the 2020 race. He also said the campaign staff who were looking into getting his name listed as a third-party candidate in Florida and several other states have been told the bid is off. Kramer admitted that his bid was serious and there were 180 people working in the ground in Florida before they decided to call off the effort. Also, he didn’t give specific reasons why the rapper allegedly withdrew but said it would be made public once everything is resolved. “I have nothing good or bad to say about Kanye. “Everyone has their personal decision about why they make decisions. ”Running for president has to be one of the hardest things for someone to actually contemplate at that level,” Kramer said. He also said they had ‘overwhelming support to get him on the ballot’ and that ‘whether anybody is going to vote for him or not is up to them’. ”Any candidate running for president for the first time goes through these hiccups,” he added.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has warned his team about four Manchester United players, ahead of Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final. Both clubs clash at Wembley, with the winner set to face Manchester City or Arsenal in the final on August 1. Lampard’s men go into the fixture sitting third in the Premier League, one point above United and Leicester City. The Red Devils have not lost since the season resumed and Lampard is wary of the threat of United’s in-form front three of Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood and Bruno Fernandes. “We know Manchester United are playing well,” Lampard said at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “They have a very potent front three, probably the most potent front three in the country on pure numbers anyway and obviously Fernandes has made a huge difference since arriving in January. “You see the strength that’s brought to their team with individual quality but we know that. We have to be confident in ourselves, deal with their threats and worry about us as well.”

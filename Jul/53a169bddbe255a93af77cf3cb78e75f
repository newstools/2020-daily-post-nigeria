Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has warned that no harm must befall the former Managing Director of the Niger-Delta Development Commission, NDDC, Joi Nunieh. Governor Wike issued the warning in a statement by his Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim in Port Harcourt. The state government said while it commends the ongoing probe in the NDDC, it will never support any action that will prevent or jeopardize the laudable intentions of President Muhammadu Buhari, to positively reposition the NDDC and fulfil the yearnings and aspirations of the people of the Niger Delta. Wike said Rivers State owes it a duty to protect her citizens from danger no matter their political affiliation and we cannot fold our hands and watch anyone harm her or any Rivers citizen. “The Rivers State Government has viewed with concern, the recent developments at the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) in which the name of our daughter, Dr. Joi Nunieh, the immediate past Acting Managing Director of the Commission, has been dragged into. “However, we wish to state that while we are not interested in identifying with the present unfolding drama in the NDDC, we will not, however, fail to protect our daughter from actual harm or perceived danger,” the statement reads. The Rivers State government called on those involved in the ongoing investigations in the NDDC to ensure that Joi Nunieh does not suffer any harm in the course of their undertakings. The former NDDC boss, Joi Nunieh is embroiled in an altercation with the Minister of Niger-Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio with the former accusing the Minister of malfeasance, oath-taking and sexual harassment, allegations Akpabio have denied.

The Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika has disclosed that aides of Very Important Persons, VIPs, and politicians who have no business traveling would not be allowed to enter the airports when domestic flights resume later this month. Siriki stated this at an interactive session with members of the Senate Committee on Aviation in Abuja on Thursday while responding to questions on protocols put in place to stop further spread of the COVID-19 Pandemic. “We have circulated this information, and Mr. President has approved it,” the minister said. “All those who have no business traveling will certainly have no business to enter the airport. They will not enter the airport, not at all. “So, anybody coming into the airport this time around as a personality, a minister or even our honourable members, distinguished senators, will not be carrying their aides into the airports anymore. “We will provide security for all VIPs, and the VIP will get in and travel. “So the VIPs should help us and take responsibility and ensure that they do not add to our problems in this country.” DAILY POST recalls that Abuja and Lagos airports will reopen on Wednesday, July 8, while those in Kano, Port Harcourt, Maiduguri and Owerri will resume operations three days after. However, there is no date for the resumption of international flights yet.

Chelsea winger, Willian, has said that he would prefer to join an MLS club instead of returning to Brazil once his career in Europe is over. Willian has signed a short-term deal to play for the Blues until the end of this season. However, he could be playing for another Premier League side next term, with Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur interested in the Brazilian. The 31-year-old is looking beyond his next club to a time when he will be close to retiring. “I have plans to stay in Europe and try to play here maybe for three or four more seasons,” Willian told ESPN Brasil’s Futebol no Mundo. “I believe I can still perform on a high level. After that, when I will be 35, 36 years old, I intend to go to the United States and play there. It is a goal that I have.”

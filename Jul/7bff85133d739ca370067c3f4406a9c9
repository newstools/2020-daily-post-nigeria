Nigeria Police operatives have rescued an American lady confined in a Lagos hotel where she was held against her wish for over a year. Force spokesman, Frank Mba, made this known in a statement on Sunday. The victim, from Washington DC, is a retired civil servant in the United States. She arrived Nigeria on 13th February, 2019 on a visit to a Nigerian, Chukwuebuka Kasi Obiaku. The 34-year-old is a native of Ikeduru LGA of Imo State. The duo met on Facebook. The victim was freed by agents attached to the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Ogun State annex. The operation followed information received from a Nigerian in the Meiran area of Lagos State. The Police described Obiaku, a graduate of Business Administration and Management, as an internet fraudster who has defrauded many both locally and internationally. He lured the America to Nigeria under the pretext of love and deceitfully married her on 15th May, 2019. The suspect subsequently held her captive in a hotel and extorted a total of $48,000. Obiaku also forcefully took control of her credit and debit cards and operated her bank accounts, including the receipt of her monthly retirement benefits and allowances. This went on for a period of fifteen months. Obiaku also used the victim as a front to defraud her associates and other foreign personalities and companies. He will be charged to court upon conclusion of investigation and prosecuted in line with the Cybercrime Prevention/Prohibition Act, 2015.

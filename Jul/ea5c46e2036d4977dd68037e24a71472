Chelsea is reportedly ready to loan out Fikayo Tomori with the centre-back potentially heading to English Premier League (EPL) side, West Ham United in a swap deal for Declan Rice. According to The Athletic, Chelsea is not willing to contemplate a permanent exit for Tomori, but a new loan is possible. Tomori has only played once for Chelsea in the Premier League in 2020. He featured in Chelsea’s away Premier League 2-2 draw against Bournemouth that saw him substituted after the host scored two quick goals at the start of the second half. Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, is a huge admirer of Rice, who has a reported price tag of around £70million. Lampard is keen to sign the 21-year-old to slot into his starting XI next season, likely at the expense of midfielder, Jorginho, who joined Chelsea in 2018 from Napoli. Chelsea could face competition from Man United for Rice’s signature. Rice began his career at Chelsea, but he joined West Ham after he was let go by Stamford Bridge club as a teenager. The England international is a close friend of Chelsea star, Mason Mount, following his time at the West London club.

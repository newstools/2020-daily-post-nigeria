The Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi on Sunday lashed out at his boss, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for tagging him a wrong choice of deputy. Ajayi emphasized that the governor was trying to put his frustration on him following the failed attempt to use the state House of Assembly to impeach him as the deputy governor. On Saturday, Akeredolu had expressed regret over the choice of Ajayi as his running mate in 2016, despite several warnings which he said he ignored. The deputy governor who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Babatope Okeowo stated that after allegedly running the state aground, Akeredolu has been casting aspersions on him. He disclosed that Akeredolu who caused himself many injuries cannot blame him for his shortcomings as he emphasized that the governor sidelined him from governance for three and half years. Ajayi added that his political experience helped Akeredolu to win the 2016 election after he failed woefully in his first attempt in 2012 when he came a distant third at the polls. “The Yoruba proverb that says when the head is rotten, the whole body is destroyed is apt in Ondo State as Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has destroyed the economy of the state and cornered her resources for few cronies and family members. “If there is any wrong choice, it is Governor Akeredolu who has refused to take all wise counsels not only from his Deputy but from senior citizens of Ondo State.”

As reactions continue to trail the arrest and suspension of the former Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, ‘Concerned Patriots for Accountability and Good Governance’ has asked those pummeling the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami to ceasefire. The group in a statement signed by Malam Musa Abubakar and Comrade Tasiu Safana, Chairman and Secretary respectively, which was sent to DAILY POST in Abuja on Tuesday condemned the campaign of calumny against Malami for exposing corruption in EFCC. The group described the tantrums against the Justice Minister as corruption fighting back, wondering why those allegations not raised before Malami exposed the EFCC former boss. “We stand to condemn the campaign of calumny unleashed against the Attorney General of the Federation Abubakar Malami. The allegations are baseless, unfounded and borne out of vindictiveness because of his stand against massive corruption now uncovered in the EFCC. “AGF Malami had made it bluntly clear that all the actions he took as regards the issue of the vessel was done in accordance with the laid down procedures and processes. They challenged those making allegations pertaining to the sales of vessels to prove where the processes laid down were breached by the Attorney-General of the Federation. The group reminded Nigerians on how Malami worked hard to recover loots in billions which they alleged has partly been re-looted by the former EFCC acting Chairman. “Since his appointment as a substantive Minister, Malami has worked tirelessly to recover billions of Nigeria’s wealth stashed abroad in the case of Abacha loot and also working hard to remedy the massive loss Nigeria may suffer as a result of the unforgivable mistake of the past in the case of P and ID. The Attorney-General has been under heavy criticisms following Ibrahim Magu’s statement to the inter-agency Presidential panel over some vessels that were ceased and sold.

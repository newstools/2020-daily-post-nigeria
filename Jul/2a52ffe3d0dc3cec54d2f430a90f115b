Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has described the administration of the Ondo State governor, Rotimi Akeredolu as the most insincere and selfish the state has ever witnessed. Giwa claimed that Akeredolu was governing Ondo State the same way President Muhammadu Buhari was ruling Nigeria. He said Akeredolu’s administration also lacked accountability. The pastor who spoke while addressing his members also pointed out that Akeredolu can only win the coming All Progressives Congress, APC, primary election through the back door. He said indirect primary was the only form of election that could make Akeredolu get the ticket of the All Progressives Congress. The cleric said the people of Ondo State had made up their minds to vote out the administration of Akeredolu. A statement he signed and sent to DAILY POST reads: “As you all know, we have been experiencing bad governance in Ondo State since Governor Akeredolu and his family took over. “We have never experienced this kind of senseless and selfish government before. No accountability, no sincerity. What kind of government is this? “They are governing Ondo State the way president Buhari is ruling Nigeria. Let me tell you that governor Akeredolu can only get the ticket of the party through the back door. “He can only win the ticket of his political party through indirect primary election. If he rigs himself in through the indirect primary, the people of Ondo State will vote him out through the governorship election. “The primary election is meant for politicians or party loyalists while the citizens of the state determine who wins the governorship election. “APC should forget Ondo State if Akeredolu secures the ticket of the party. Ondo people cannot continue to serve Governor Akeredolu, his children, wife and in-laws.”

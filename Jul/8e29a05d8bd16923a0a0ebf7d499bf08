Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has accused Arsenal of revelling in their downfall, even when “they don’t have much to celebrate”. This followed a Facebook post by the Gunners media team last week. After Spurs lost to Sheffield United, Arsenal uploaded highlights of their FA Cup quarter-final victory over the Blades to their 38 million Facebook followers. The caption read: “It’s not easy beating Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Here’s a reminder of how it’s done.” Tottenham face Arsenal this Sunday and Mourinho told reporters ahead of Monday’s game against Everton that: “If they were top of the league or fighting for top four and in a really good moment, they wouldn’t enjoy the problems of others. “You only enjoy the problems of others when you are also in trouble. So I think in the end, it’s a little more about that. They don’t have much to celebrate, so they have to take any opportunity to do it. They are in a very similar situation to us in the table. “I don’t like to connect the club with such posts or tweets because probably, the person who did it, did it by himself. I don’t believe it was (Mikel) Arteta who posted it — probably it was some guy who has been working from home for three months. No problem, at home we will be waiting for them!”

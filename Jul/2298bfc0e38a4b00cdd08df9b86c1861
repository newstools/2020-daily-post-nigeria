Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has pointed out some of the upcoming fixtures that might decide the top four spots in the Premier League. Solskjaer, however, expects the race to qualify for next season’s Champions League to go down to the last matchday of the season. United will move into the top four for some hours at least if they beat Bournemouth on Saturday before Chelsea take on Watford later on Saturday. Solskjaer’s men are only three points behind third-placed Leicester City, who they play on the last day of the season. Chelsea faces a potentially decisive final day game against Wolves, who are currently sixth and level on points with Solskjaer’s side. “I think the last round of fixtures is going to be vital. “You have got Chelsea vs Wolves and us against Leicester – so it might be a three-point advantage for us or Leicester and it is still an important game. “And I can’t see the difference between us and Leicester being a lot more than three points either way and it is the same with Chelsea and Wolves. “It’s looking exciting, It’s a short space of time and so many games in that time but I think it will go down to the last game,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports.

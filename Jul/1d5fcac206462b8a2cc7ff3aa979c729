The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, has denied he is planning for president in 2023. This was contained in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media, Ola Awoniyi, on Saturday. Lawan was reacting to speculations that he could run for the highest office in the land, after President Muhammadu Buhari’s second term elapses. In the statement, he said it was too early for anyone to harbour ambitions for 2023. “The report apparently has its source in beer parlour gossips and should be treated with the contempt which it and those who concocted it deserves. “It is true that the Senate President was involved in the consultations that President Muhammadu Buhari held prior to the last emergency meeting of the National Executive Committee of the ruling All Progressives Congress,” the statement read in part.

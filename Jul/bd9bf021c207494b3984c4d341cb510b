President Muhammadu Buhari has come under fire over the decision of his government to free over 600 Boko Haram terrorists on Saturday. The ex-Boko Haram members were freed and integrated into the society on Saturday. The decision has since angered many Nigerians who believe that it is dangerous to have such persons in society. Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, is one of those against the decision. He tweeted, “Look at this nonsense released by General @MBuhari’s government. They have the gall to release graduation photos of so-called ‘repentant’ Boko Haram. “What rubbish! Because of these people, Leah Sharibu and Chibok Girls could not graduate! This is why I fully support #ArrestBuhari.” DAILY POST broke the news on Saturday that the Nigerian military has reintegrated 601 ex-Boko Haram terrorists into the society. The terrorists, according to the report, include 14 foreign nationals from Cameroon, Chad and Niger. The Coordinator, Operation Safe Corridor, Major General Bamidele Shafa made the announcement on Saturday. The former fighters were freed at the DRR Camp in Mallam Sidi, Gombe State. General Shafa said on arrival at the camp, “the clients went through documentation processes to obtain vital background information and were subjected to comprehensive medical screening to determine their health status”.

Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie has advised Nigerian youths to be judicious in spending their money while voting for Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemates this season. Edochie urged viewers to rather channel the resources to voting for himself and the likes of Banky Wellington during elections. The actor gave the advice on Saturday in a post on his Twitter page. According to him, the looters will keep winning if youths do not campaign for credible people like him. His tweet read: “I love the fact that youths are getting angry with the system. Elections will come again. “As you spend your money campaigning for BBNaija housemates, reserve the one you’ll use to campaign for credible youths like me, Banky W & others. “If not, the looters and fainters will win us.”

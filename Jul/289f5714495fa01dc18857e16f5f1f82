The Leadership of Tiv people in Taraba State said it is ever ready to welcome the military investigative team that was promised to conduct investigations into allegations of military killings, raping and destruction in State. This was disclosed during an interview with the President-General, Tiv Cultural and Social Association (TCSA), Goodman Dahida while reacting to the response of the military over the recent accusations against its troops in the state. The Tiv people in Taraba on Thursday accused military troops deployed to Taraba to end the Tiv/Jukun crisis of killings, raping and destroying properties of the Tiv people. But the military in a statement issued on Friday by Major General John Enenche, Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Defence Headquarters, debunked the claims, Eneche in the statement said the military will, therefore, not hesitate to conduct investigations to unravel the claims by the Tiv leadership in Taraba State. Goodman while speaking on claims by the military said the Tiv people are well equipped with facts, evidence and human beings who were shot by the military troops who claimed they were looking for bandits in the area. The Tiv leader also displayed pictures of children who were shot and killed at the spot by the military within the village, pictures of women, adults and young men who were treated in different hospitals were also displayed during the interview. He said such investigations if conducted by the Army will expose so many misdeeds and illegal operations conducted against poor and helpless civilians who he said were rather supposed to be protected by the military.

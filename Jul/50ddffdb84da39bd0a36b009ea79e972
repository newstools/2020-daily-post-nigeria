Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, has said that the All Progressives Congress, APC, will shock the incumbent Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, in the September 19 governorship election. Ganduje accused Obaseki of failure in the service of the people of his state, adding that the Governor was only busy fighting everyone. Governor Ganduje said that apart from all manner of litigation, Obaseki has nothing else on ground to convince the people to reelect him. The Kano Governor, who is the Chairman, Edo State Governorship Campaign Council for the APC, predicted that Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu would floor Obaseki. A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Abba Anwar quoted Ganduje as saying his party would comply with the provisions of the Electoral Act, adding that they would also comply with the COVID-19 public health protocols. The Governor said, “The art of governance is to provide social and economic development, infrastructural facilities, peace and stability. But all of these are lacking in Edo state under Mr Obaseki.” “What has he (Obaseki) on the ground to show to Edo people that he deserves re-election? He has 53 cases in courts and was busy fighting with his people. Apart from all such litigation, he then crossed over to another party and abandoned the governance of his people. “He has his people in his heart,’ the governor said of Ize-Iyamu adding that “when he came to our party, he came with all his people.” He claimed that when the incumbent Obaseki joined the main opposition PDP, he was accompanied by his cabinet alone, “because his people didn’t see any reason why he should be followed.”

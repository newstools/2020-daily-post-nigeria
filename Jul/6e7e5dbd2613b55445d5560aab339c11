The Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri has reacted to the Supreme Court ruling affirming him as the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, during the November 2019 gubernatorial election in the State. Diri described his victory at the apex court as God’s divine intervention in the affairs of the ‘Prosperity Government’. The Supreme Court had dismissed a suit by a governorship aspirant on the platform of PDP, Timi Alaibe challenging the candidacy of Diri during the last election in the state. Alaibe’s suit was dismissed by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour, after the appellant withdrew from the matter. Reacting, the governor urged people of the state and those in opposition to join hands with him in building the state. Represented by his deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, he spoke at the state Government House Chapel, in Yenagoa, the state capital, yesterday. He commended the Supreme Court for its uprightness and incorruptibility in the dispensation of justice. According to Diri, the ruling has rekindled the people’s confidence in the Judiciary. He said: “We want to give all the glory, adoration, thanks and praises to God for what He has done for us again. “This victory again shows that power comes from God alone. We also want to thank God for giving us, mortal and sinful people, the opportunity to serve this state. “As you are aware, there has been a lot of hype about this case. But we thank God, He has proved His supremacy over the affairs of men. “Let me on behalf of the Miracle Gov. Douye Diri appreciate the uprightness of the Supreme Court and the determination and incorruptibility of the Judiciary. “This is because right from the Federal High Court, Owerri, it has been the same song that he has no case,” he said.

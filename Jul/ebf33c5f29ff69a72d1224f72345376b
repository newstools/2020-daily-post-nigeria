He said the Command has mobilized its men to the area to salvage the situation. “We are aware of the unfortunate cult clash between Greenlanders and Icelanders today at the Amadi-Ama axis. They engaged in their usual senseless war of seeking for supremacy. “We were alerted and we mobilized almost immediately and we were able to restore normalcy. A keke driver was shot on the leg and he is receiving medical attention. “We immediately mobilized to the scene of the crime and took over the place. The bad boys fled on our arrival.”

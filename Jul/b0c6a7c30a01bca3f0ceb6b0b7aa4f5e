The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has condemned the call that its chieftains be probed over alleged link to a fraudster, Ramond Abbas popularly known as Hushpuppi. Recall that APC’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Yekini Nabena had called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to probe ex-PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar; ex-Senate President, Bukola Saraki, and ex-Kogi West Senator, Dino Melaye over alleged link to Hushpuppi. However, PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan described APC’s call as irresponsible and reckless. Ologbondiyan stated that such a call has exposed APC’s victimization agenda in using agencies under its control to frame innocent opposition members, perceived opponents of the government on trumped-up charges under the guise of fighting corruption. The statement reads partly: “PDP describes the fabrications by the APC against prominent opposition members over alleged fraudster, Raymond Abbas, aka Hushpuppi, as reckless, irresponsible and further exposed the victimization agenda of the “The desperate bid to frame innocent Nigerians who are not in any way involved with Hushpuppi, even after a very broad investigation by prominent investigators including the United States’ Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), leaves no one in doubt that APC government has been victimizing opposition members with fabricated charges. “While our party has no link whatsoever with Hushpuppi, as the APC also acknowledged, Nigerians are aware that his pictures with some prominent Nigerians, such as former Vice President Atiku which the APC is frenzied about, do not suggest any affinity beyond the usual jostling by people, world over, to be photographed with leaders.”

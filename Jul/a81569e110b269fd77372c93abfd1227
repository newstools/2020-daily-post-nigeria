Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has alleged that the All Progressives Congress, APC, chose the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Umar Ganduje as the Chairman of their campaign council for Edo governorship election because they saw him pocketing dollars. Wike said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) cannot be intimidated by the APC. Wike said this at the inauguration of a 93-man PDP National campaign council for the election at the party’s national secretariat in Abuja, yesterday. Recall that Ganduje had threatened that his party will isolate Wike until the election is over . Wike, who heads the PDP 93-man National campaign council for the governorship election, said, “Let me tell you; why they made Ganduje chairman of the campaign council is because of the dollar they saw. “But for dollar, Ganduje could not have been made the chairman of the campaign council. “But what he doesn’t understand is that we, from the Niger Delta, we shall chop his dollar and chop him into coma. So, Ganduje your dollar will not work in Edo State. We have integrity in our party.

Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville has blasted midfielder, Paul Pogba for handing West Ham United a penalty during the Red Devils’ Premier League 1-1 draw against the visitors on Wednesday night at Old Trafford. Pogba was punished for handball in the area, and a penalty was awarded to West Ham which was converted by Michail Antonio to give the Hammers a 1-0 lead in the first half. Man United levelled in the second half through Mason Greenwood and now need a point against Leicester City on Sunday, to qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League. But Neville, who was not happy with Pogba’s display, labelled the France World Cup winner as ‘rubbish and embarrassing’, adding that the 27-year-old should have taken Declan Rice’s shot “in the grid”, rather than throwing up his hands against West Ham. “He’s in trouble, Paul Pogba, he’s in big, big trouble,” Neville said on Sky Sports as replays confirmed the handball. “He’s given a penalty away, he’s put his arms up and pretends it’s hit his head. “Rubbish, Rubbish from him. To think, I felt a little bit sorry for him, I thought he took a whack in the head. Embarrassing. “You don’t do that. You take it in the grid. It’s Rubbish from him, Rubbish!”

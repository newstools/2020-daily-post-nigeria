The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Niger Delta, Olubumi Ojo has excused himself from the hearing into the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) following accusation of conflict of interest. The lawmaker stepped aside for Thomas Ereyitomi to continue the investigation into mismanagement of funds by the Commission. It would be recalled that the Acting Managing Director of the commission, Prof Kemebradikumo Pondei last week staged a walkout on the committee, stating that Mr. Ojo is a man of interest in the ongoing investigation. The committee again on Friday summoned both Prof. Pondei and Sen Godswill Akpabio, the minister for Niger Delta Affairs, following revelations by the former Acting Managing Director of the Commission, Joi Nunieh. At the commencement of the investigation today, Mr. Ojo declared that, “I want say clearly that my colleagues and the leadership has passed a vote of confidence on me, however, I will like to excuse myself from this investigative hearing.”

On Sunday, a 60-year-old man, whose details were not given was arrested in Nkwelle Ezunaka, near Onitsha for raping a nine-year-old girl, while another 28 year-old-man, Chinonso Ugochukwu was arrested in Uli, Ihiala LGA for raping a five-year-old girl. The third, Mr Sunday Eyim was on Tuesday arrested in Amawbia, Awka South LGA, after neighbours reported that he had canal knowledge of a four-year-old girl. Police Public Relations Officer for Anambra State Police Command, SP Haruna Mohammed who disclosed this in a press release said Eyim was arrested a day after he lured the minor to his room and had canal knowledge of her. He said, “On the 13/7/2020 following a tip-off, police operatives attached to CPS Awka arrested one Sunday Eyim ‘m’ aged 31 years, of Oruana village Amawbia in Awka South LGA of Anambra State. “Suspect had on the 11/7/2020 allegedly defiled a 4-year-old girl in his room. The scene was visited by police detectives and the victim taken to the hospital for medical examination where penetration was confirmed.” Haruna quoted the state police commissioner, CP John B.Abang as having directed that the case be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Awka for discreet investigation after which suspect would be charged to court for prosecution. He also called on members of the public particularly, parents/guardians to be watchful and caution their children against strangers and also encourage them to report any person making sexual advances or harassment on them to enable the parent to take proactive measures before it becomes intractable. “The public should also be security conscious at all times and always report suspicious rape cases in their neighborhood to the nearest police stations for prompt action.”

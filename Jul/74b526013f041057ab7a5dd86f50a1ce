The Magistrate Court sitting in Issele-Uku Magisterial District in Aniocha North local government area of Delta State on Wednesday, ordered the remand of Prince Chukwunronso Justin Nwoko a.k.a Obi Nonso and five others in police custody over alleged murder, pending the determination of the case at the next court sitting. The Delta State Police Command (Homicide Section) had charged the Idumuje-Ugboko Prince to court after concluding their investigations on his involvement in the murder and unlawful disposal of the body of a motorcycle rider, Cyprian Kumaoro during the 2017 intra-communal violence allegedly instigated by Prince Nonso Nwoko. Prince Nonso was charged alongside other suspects; Chetachukwu Okolo, Onyeisi Isuzor, Ifejoku Okey, Prince Ejimofor Nwoko and Prince Obiajulu Richard Nwoko for murder and criminal conspiracy. Recall that Prince Nonso Nwoko was arrested by a team of policemen on July 17, 2020 and released on self-recognition on July 18, 2020. He was later invited for further questioning over the murder of Cyprian Kumaoro following the confession of two suspects earlier arrested and charged on the same matter. The Police Commissioner in Delta, CP Hafiz Mohammed Inuwa, had in his briefing to the press, stated that nobody was above the law and anyone who had committed a crime as serious as murder would face justice. However, the Magistrate in his ruling ordered that Prince Nonso Nwoko and others be remanded at the Police Commandâ€™s detention facility as the Prisons were not holding inmates due to COVID-19 pandemic. The commencement of court trial of Prince Nonso among others marked the end of rigorous investigation on the celebrated case of murder at Idumuje-Ugboko kingdom in 2017.

Barcelona have made a formal contract offer for Chelsea winger, Willian, according to Sky Sports. The La Liga giants are understood to have fulfilled Willian’ request for a three-year deal. Willian’s contract with Chelsea is due to expire this summer. The 31-year-old has been holding out for a 3-year deal from Chelsea, but Frank Lampard’s side are only willing to offer a contract for the next two years. But Barcelona have now pleased Willian’s request. DAILY POST recalls that the Brazilian international was reportedly offered a deal worth £250,000 a week earlier this year by Arsenal, but the North London club were forced to reconsider due to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Willian has also drawn interest from Manchester United, Tottenham and Inter Miami. He is now expected to decide on his future after this Saturday’s FA Cup against Arsenal. Meanwhile, Willian’s agent, Kia Joorabchian, had a few days ago provided the latest update on his client’s future at Chelsea.

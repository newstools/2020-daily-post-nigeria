Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, is set to break Premier League records when his team host Chelsea in today’s fixture at Anfield. This was made known in a post via Liverpool’s official website on Wednesday. A win for Liverpool against Frank Lampard’s side will ensure Klopp’s men equal the Premier League record for most home points earned in a season. The three points would take the Reds to 55 to match the tallies totaled by Chelsea in 2005/2006, Manchester United in 2010/2011 and Manchester City in 2011/2012. Liverpool will also for the first time in the club’s history remain undefeated at Anfield in three consecutive league seasons. Klopp’s side are three goals short of recording 50 at home for the second successive season – a feat not achieved since 1983/1984. A win tonight would also see the Premier League champions becoming only the fourth team to win more than 30 league matches. Liverpool have had seventeen different scorers in the league this season to equal the club record previously set in 1911/1912 and 2015/2016.

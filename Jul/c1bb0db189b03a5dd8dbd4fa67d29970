Reno Omokri has warned against any form of attack on Joy Nunieh, a former Acting Managing Director of Interim Management Committee of the Niger Delta Development Commission, who recently made some damning revelations about the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio. Addressing the press after she appeared before the Senate ad-hoc Committee investigating NDDC, Mrs. Nunieh recounted her ordeal at the hands of the Minister before she was removed as the NDDC MD. Among other claims, she said “Nobody makes any payment in NDDC without Godswill Akpabio’s approval. When we first came, on the day of the inauguration, he said to me in the car, ‘Madam MD, if you don’t do what I say, the same pen with which I used to sign your paper is the same pen I’ll use to remove you. Following her many revelations, Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan on New Media believes Nunieh’s revelations could put her life in danger. In a tweet on Saturday, Omokri said, “Nothing must happen to the ex-Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Corporation, Joy Nunieh, who has just made shocking allegations of corruption against @Senator_Akpabio, Festus @FKeyamo and Gen @MBuhari. “I have been informed of a threat to her life.”

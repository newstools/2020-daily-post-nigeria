Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has described the decision to overturn Manchester City’s two-year European ban as “disgraceful” and “a disaster”. City are free to play in the Champions League next term, following Monday’s successful appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). CAS also reduced their £26.8million fine to £8.9million. Mourinho, speaking at a virtual press conference on Tuesday, said he could not understand why City will pay a fine if they are not guilty. “It’s a disgraceful decision. If City are not guilty of it, then you are not punished with €10m. “If you’re not guilty then you shouldn’t have a fine. If they are guilty then the decision is also a disgrace and you should be banned from the competition. “I don’t know if Manchester City are guilty or not but either way, it’s a disgraceful decision,” Mourinho said.

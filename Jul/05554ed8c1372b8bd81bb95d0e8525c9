Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp will be without three players, Jordan Henderson, Joel Matip and James Milner when they face Arsenal in tonight’s Premier League clash at Emirates Stadium due to injury. Henderson and Matip have knee and foot injuries respectively, while Milner is continuing his rehabilitation from a minor muscle injury. Liverpool made this known in a post via its official website on Tuesday night. The Reds head to the game following a 1-1 draw with Burnley in their last game. Speaking at his pre-match press conference, Klopp said: “Millie is in contention, or is pretty safe, for the Chelsea game [next week Wednesday]. “We should have the same squad as we had for the Burnley game.” “Jordan Henderson (knee) and Joel Matip (foot) remain sidelined,” he added. The game is scheduled at 8:15 pm.

Barcelona manager, Quique Setién and Manchester City coach, Pep Guardiola have reacted to their side’s UEFA Champions League quarter-finals draws. DAILY POST had earlier reported that UEFA on Friday announced the draws in Nyon, Switzerland. Barcelona, who will battle Napoli in the Champions League second leg, round of 16 clashes in August will face the winner between Bayern Munich and Chelsea if they beat the Italian Serie A side at Camp Nou. Man City, who will tackle Real Madrid in the Champions League second leg round of 16 clash in August, will face the winner between Lyon and Juventus if they defeat or draw against the La Liga giants at Etihad. Reacting, Setien told a pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of Barcelona’s La Liga clash against Valladolid on Saturday: “I think it’s important that we focus on the game against Napoli which is the key. We know that we are going to be playing at home now, which I think is fair. As for the rest of the draw, it’s OK to know what it is, and it’s good to analyse some of the possible opponents, but the first thing we have to do is focus on, first of all, tomorrow against Real Valladolid. We need three points if we want to be up there, then the game against Napoli is vital for us. When the moment comes we will face that but right now we’re focused on the first challenge. We have to win and keep our options open on winning the title.” Also reacting, Guardiola told a pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of Man City’s Premier League clash against Brighton on Saturday: “In this organisation, there is no one who knows Real better than me. They are the dominant team in the Champions League, and we have to focus on them,” Guardiola told reporters ahead of Saturday’s Premier League clash against Brighton & Hove Albion. “We think about Real. If we think about the next step when we are playing against the king of this competition, they will put us out.”

One Sunday Odigwe and his wife, Rosemary have been arrested by policemen from Ovwian/Aladja Divisional Headquarters for allegedly torturing and inflicting bodily injuries on a thirteen-year-old girl simply identified as Chioma. The couple who almost killed the thirteen-year-old girl before were arrested at their residence situated at DSC Shell Quarters in Udu Local Government Area of Delta State. Their arrest was made possible following a tip-off from one Adeniyi who was directed by Tobore Anne to call a human rights activist, Comrade Israel Joe over the matter. It was learned that the couple are the guardian of the young girl whose father died long ago, leaving her in the hands of her stepbrother and his wife who had allegedly tortured the girl for many years. An eyewitness who craved anonymity said the couple boasted that they will use their money to cover up the case should the police or court get involved in the matter. Comrade Israel Joe who confirmed the arrest of the couple in a chat with DAILY POST in Warri also condemned the alleged act by the couple saying,”Parents should endeavour to take care of their children themselves. “They should not give out their children to any guardian who cannot take care of themselves.” Joe thanked the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Mohammed Hafiz Inuwa, especially for continued support in the fight against child torture, molestation, rape and sexual harassment in the society. “I equally appreciate Mr. Adeniyi who against all odds including threats confronted the injustice and the DPO Ovwian/Aladja Division, CSP Muhammed Muazu who promptly detailed an emergency patrol team to me for the arrest. We hope the couple will be charged to Court and Chioma be taken away from them.” The Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Mohammed Hafiz Inuwa is yet to pick calls or respond to text messages sent across to his mobile phone. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya who acknowledged receiving a text message from Our correspondent said, “I have not gotten a response yet,” just as she promised to return with details. However, the Ovwian/Aladja Divisional Police Officer, CSP Muhammed Mu’Azu who confirmed the arrest of the couple said, “We are on it Sir. No problems.”

Security agencies have neutralized several Ansaru sect terrorists engaged in banditry in Kaduna State. An intelligence source in the anti-banditry operation told PRNigeria that the Ansaru elements have been responsible for a number of recent deadly attacks. He said aggressive ground attack, as well as air onslaught by Nigerian Air Force (NAF) jets, took out the group’s fighters in this week. They had been spotted via drones and other tracking devices deployed around forests they use as hideouts. The source said the Kaduna government, through the Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, now runs a 24-hour Situation Room. “The facility receives and process vital intelligence for instant transmission to relevant security agencies. This has assisted us greatly in terms of swift response to attacks”. The security operative, however, regretted retaliatory attacks between Fulani and farmers, revealing that some were actually caused by outlaws. “Some captured kingpins of gangs, during interrogations, confessed their sinister roles in the crises. “The state should further engage community leaders, youths, media and others to realise that the enemies are local and foreign criminals not innocent citizens,” he added.

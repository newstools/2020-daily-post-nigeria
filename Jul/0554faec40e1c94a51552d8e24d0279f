The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom on Monday, signed into law, the revised appropriation bill of N108.8 billion for the year 2020. The Governor said the action became necessary following the reduction in oil-related and non-oil revenues to the state occasioned by coronavirus. He also said that despite the reduction in the current expenditure estimates by 59 percent, government had kept faith with its responsibility to the general workforce by protecting the personnel budget with very minimal reductions in some discretionary allowances. According to him, the bulk of the reduction were made on non-critical overhead costs, stressing that overhead provisions that are critical to the COVID-19 response had been retained or increased in some cases. He also reiterated his determination towards provision of infrastructure, security of lives and property of Benue people and the general welfare of the people despite reduction in the budget estimates. DAILY POST reports that the revised budget has a total reduction of N80 billion from the earlier N190.8bn assented to by the Governor. This translates to 43 per cent reduction in the earlier reviewed budget signed by the Governor on 30th December, 2020.

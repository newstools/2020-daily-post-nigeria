The General Overseer of New Life Church of God, Shagamu, has been arrested for the kidnap of Mr. Job Jonathan, a Dispatch Rider with a logistics company. The Force Public Relations Officer, (FPRO), Mr Frank MBA, confirmed his arrest at a media briefing on Wednesday in Abuja. The pastor who is the leader of the gang was also arrested with three other members, NAN reports. He said the logistics company, which majored in the distribution of Forever Living Products, had detailed Jonathan to deliver the product following orders placed online. “Jonathan rode his motorcycle to Ikorodu, but directed to proceed to Sagamu without knowledge of the fact that he was going to be kidnapped.<img class="aligncenter wp-image-822602 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspect2.jpeg" alt="" width="720" height="720" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspect2.jpeg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspect2-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspect2-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspect2-80x80.jpeg 80w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspect2-45x45.jpeg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> “On arrival at the location which turned out to be a church, the product was not only collected, but the dispatch rider was also immediately held hostage,” Mba told newsmen. Mba disclosed that the pastor, also the leader of the gang, held the dispatch rider in a beautiful underground cabin he built within the church premises for 10 days. According to him, when Jonathan began to struggle to escape, the pastor, who clearly is not a certified health personnel, forcefully administered anesthesia on Jonathan. He said Jonathan was rescued by the police after complaints by the company of his disappearance.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-822603" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspects.jpeg" alt="" width="662" height="662" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspects.jpeg 662w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspects-300x300.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspects-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspects-80x80.jpeg 80w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/suspects-45x45.jpeg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 662px) 100vw, 662px">

Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., National Coordinator Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has maintained that he was not being mischievous about his claim that former Vice President Atiku Abubakar could return to the All Progressives Congress, APC, ahead of the 2023 presidential election. Recall that Atiku Abubakar dumped the ruling APC in 2018 ahead of the 2019 presidential election which he contested on the platform of the PDP and lost to the incumbent President and candidate of the APC, Muhammadu Buhari. But in a chat with DAILY POST on Friday, Bamgbose said that as the 2023 presidential election draws near and politician strategise, that he foresees Atiku going back to the APC. In his reaction through Mr. Paul Ibe, his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, the 2019 presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, said, “Mr. Olusegun Bamgbose so-called ‘seeing’ is delusional, possibly induced by cerebral malaria, and requires immediate intensive medical help”. “He is a third-rate seer and is urged to desist from this mischief.” Bamgbose insisted that it was only a matter of time and that Atiku will leave the PDP again, adding that he won’t join issues with the former VP who he described as a political giant. “Atiku, the former Vice President has reacted to my opinion that he may switch over to APC in 2021, harshly. “I’m actually not bothered because Atiku is a political heavyweight in Nigerian politics and I won’t be prepared to join issues with him. He is my senior in age and in politics. “He is the former Vice President of the country. He deserves some respect. However, I still insist on what I’ve said. It’s only time that can prove me wrong. “Come 2023, we shall meet on the field and I’ll be prepared to slug it out with him. He is no doubt a political giant, but then, I’m not in any way intimidated by his political pedigree.

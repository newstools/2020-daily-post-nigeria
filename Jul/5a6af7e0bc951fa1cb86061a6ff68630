Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has spoken on the distinctions between winger, Christian Pulisic and former Blues winger, Eden Hazard ahead of his side’s Premier League clash with Crystal Palace on Tuesday evening. Hazard left Chelsea last summer to join Real Madrid after leading the club to win the UEFA Europa League. Pulisic joined Chelsea from Borussia Dortmund following the departure of Hazard. When asked on what he sees as the main differences between them, Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying on Monday that: “Eden [Hazard] had a special talent straightaway of being able to receive the ball, show great balance and go past players. “He would draw a lot of players towards him to open up space for his teammates, and he was pretty unselfish with making assists that way. “Christian [Pulisic] is possibly more direct in his style sometimes, in terms of how he goes past players and runs off the ball, which I like. “He has a real ability to break a line and run forward. That is an excellent trait in the modern game. “Eden has been here and done it, and did it to an incredible level. “Christian has it in his hands to make a real impact over a period of time.”

Lille president, Gérard Lopez, has predicted that striker, Victor Osimhen, will become a ‘superstar’ at Napoli if he eventually joins the Serie A giants this summer’s transfer window. Lopez also said that Osimhen has the strength to perform under pressure, adding that the 21-year-old has an extraordinary life. DAILY POST recalls that Napoli are favourite to sign Osimhen this summer after the Nigerian international visited Italy last week to hold talks with Gennaro Gattuso’s side over a possible move. Osimhen, who enjoyed a brilliant debut season at Lille, has also been linked with several big clubs in Italy, Spain and England, but he could now be set to join the Naples outfit. “If he goes there [Napoli], he’ll be their superstar. Having Naples at your feet must be something in the life of a footballer. Victor has the strength to perform under pressure,” Lopez told France Football. “We had several offers for Victor. We exchanged a lot. We get on well, and he has an extraordinary life. “He asked me, and I gave him the name of the club that we think is best for him. And by his style of play, the coach and the progression he envisions.”

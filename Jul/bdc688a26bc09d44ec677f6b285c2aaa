Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said Harry Kane “would not be so special” at another team. Kane, who recovered from a hamstring tendon issue during the COVID-19 break, looked back to his best with two sublime goals as Spurs defeated Leicester 3-0 on Sunday. The 26-year-old had signed a six-year contract extension in 2018, but admitted in March he could leave if the North London club don’t progress in the right direction. “I think everyone thinks he’s a fantastic player and Tottenham are so lucky to have him because he’s the player, the person and the Tottenham boy,” Mourinho told reporters. “All this together makes him really a special player for us that probably would not be so special playing for another team. He’s really special for us, he’s really special for Tottenham.” Spurs are on course to secure a place in the Europa League next season after the win against the Foxes.

The Bauchi State Government has denied that it has concluded arrangements to reopen schools in the state as currently being rumoured in the state. The denial was made today by the state Commissioner for Education, Aliyu Usman Tilde, during an interview with journalists in Bauchi. According to Tilde, schools resuming at this critical period will gulp millions of naira from the Federal Government, which has to put necessary arrangements in place towards preventing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. He stated that such arrangements include the provision of hand sanitizers, face masks for students and teachers as well as creating more classrooms for physical distancing. Tilde informed that stakeholders in the education sector, including the Federal Government, are working hard to ensure Covid-19 protocols as enumerated by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) are put in place before schools reopen. “The Federal Government and other stakeholders in the education sector are working to ensure that all the NCDC protocols in preventing the spread of Coronavirus is fully in place before the schools reopen in order to save the lives of both students and teachers,” the commissioner stated. He assured that schools in the state will reopen as soon as the Federal Government provides assistance for the control of Covid-19 in the country. “The schools in the state will be opened as soon as the Federal Government provides the needed assistance for the control of the pandemic in the country. “So, it is not true that the state government wants to open schools, because the decision to do that is based on the directives of the Federal Government. “We want to comply with the instruction of the Federal Government on school resumption,” Tilde said.

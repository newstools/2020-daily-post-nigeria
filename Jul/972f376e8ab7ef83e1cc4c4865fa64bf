A member of the Federal Government Special Public Works Programme (SPWP) in Ebonyi, Ann Agomeze, has explained the criteria for selection. Agomeze spoke on Friday in Onicha Local Government at a stakeholders meeting in Abakaliki. The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain said selection of beneficiaries of the programme will be based on merit. She said Nigerians to benefit are “the lowly and vulnerable members” of every local government across Nigeria. Agomeze confirmed that the committee will engage both skilled and unskilled labours. It will look out for people with low education qualifications, such as secondary school leavers, trained artisans as well as graduates. Agomeze urged stakeholders to ensure that only eligible members were mobilised to take part in empowerment programme. She told the that the exercise must be “inclusive and non political”. “We must do things better and should bear in mind that the success of the programme in our council lies on everyone of us. The success of the programme will determine if it will continue. “It is our duty to ensure that the 1000 persons expected to participate in the programme in the local government are carefully selected to represent categories of people needed.” The committee member noted that the recruitment was part of government strategies to cushion the COVID-19 impact She added that the programme “will benefit more, less privileged Nigerians unlike the N-power that only those with higher educational qualifications can apply online”. “This programme which will benefit 774,000 poor Nigerians is to ensure that more people enjoy the dividends of democracy and that they are lifted out of poverty especially in this period of pandemic,” Agomeze said.

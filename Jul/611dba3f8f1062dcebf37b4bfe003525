= Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has tipped Chelsea, Manchester City and Manchester United, to challenge his side next season for the title. Klopp led the Reds to a first league triumph in 30 years this year. Liverpool have stormed to the title almost unchallenged and are on track to break the record number of points acquired in a season. However, Klopp does not expect them to cruise to the title next season. The German has identified three rivals that will challenge them as they look to retain the trophy. “City will be strong next season, United will be strong next season, Chelsea will be strong next season. “The three of them, it’s obvious – City is just an outstanding team, United are in outstanding shape, Chelsea are in really good shape and is doing some interesting business. “Tottenham will not sleep, Arsenal will not sleep, Leicester will be there. The thing is, we have to play 38 games and who wins most of them can win the league,” Klopp told a Zoom press conference on Wednesday.

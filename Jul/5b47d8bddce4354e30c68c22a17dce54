Former Liverpool forward, Peter Crouch has predicted that Chelsea and Manchester United will secure a place in the Premier League top four this weekend. He said Ole Gunner Solskjaer and Frank Lampard’s men will wrap up their place in next season’s Champions League while Brendan Rodgers’ side will settle for the Europa League. Leicester City, Chelsea and United go into the final day of the league season on Sunday sitting on third, fourth and fifth on the log. While Leicester host United in a must-win match for them, Chelsea face stubborn Wolves, knowing a draw should be enough to get them over the line. Crouch told Daily Mail, “I will make the call now and say that Chelsea and Manchester United will finish third and fourth. If that happens, nonetheless, I will have some sympathy for Leicester. “They have been up there all season, looking certainties to qualify for much of it, but they have run out of gas. “There is still a glimmer of hope – never rule out a team with Jamie Vardy upfront – but losing three-quarters of their defence on the run-in has been a hammer blow. They will do well to recover from the setbacks they have had on Sunday.”

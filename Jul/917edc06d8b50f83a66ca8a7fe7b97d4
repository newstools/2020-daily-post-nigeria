Manchester United on Thursday sold academy defender, Ben Hockenhull, to Championship club, Brentford, ahead of the 2020 summer transfer window which will take place between July 27 and October 5. Hockenhull, 18, joined Brentford’s reserve side on a two-year deal. Man United made the announcement in a post via the club’s official website. “Manchester United Academy defender Ben Hockenhull has completed a move to Championship club Brentford,” the statement read in part. “The young centre-back signed a third-year scholarship registration agreement with United after the Academy season was curtailed due to the COVID-19 global pandemic. “Everybody at Manchester United would like to wish Ben well for the future following his departure.” Reacting, Brentford B head coach, Neil MacFarlane said: “First and foremost, Ben is coming from a top football club. He’s somebody that has a fantastic presence on the pitch. “As a centre-back, size is important in English football, but he has got much more to his game than that. “He is fantastic on the ball and in possession, and with us being a possession-based team, that’ll stand him in good stead. We think there is lots more development in Ben and he’ll be a great addition to the squad.”

The United States on Wednesday warned telecom companies around the world against doing business with the Chinese tech giant, Huawei. The State Department gave the warning in a statement on Wednesday. Those doing business with Huawei were told to consider themselves fraternising with “human rights abusers”. “Telecommunications companies around the world should consider themselves on notice. If they are doing business with Huawei, they are doing business with human rights abusers,” the statement said. The department announced visa restrictions on some Huawei employees and Chinese tech firms for allegedly facilitating human right violations. The U.S. alleged that certain Huawei employees “provide material support” to the Chinese government “that commits human rights abuses”. President Donald Trump’s administration has been pressuring allies to cut Huawei off their 5G networks over cybersecurity concerns. The American leader accuses the Chinese government of using the company to conduct cyber espionage, an accusation Huawei denied. The visa restrictions were announced after the United Kingdom banned the company from its 5G networks. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said the UK had joined “a growing list of countries from around the world that are standing up for their national security”.

Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba has named the four (4) Red Devils teammates he enjoys watching in action. Pogba has completed his comeback from long-term injury since the Premier League restart last month. The France World winner has helped Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men to win four out of their first five games. However, Pogba said he has been hugely impressed by his attacking teammates, Bruno Fernandes, Anthony Martial, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood so far this season. According to him, he loved every minute of watching them from the sidelines or further back on the pitch. The former Juventus star said this ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash against Aston Villa on Thursday night. “From behind (them) I just enjoy it. I am enjoying just watching Bruno, Rashford, Martial and Mason, who all played the last game, and seeing them score goals,” Pogba told United Review. “You just keep applauding, and it’s beautiful, they make me enjoy football every time.” He added: “As well though there is the defensive work that people do not talk about – they do it. The pressing, they do it, and that’s what you maybe do not see that much.”

A former Transition Committee Chairman of Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State, Ms. Chinwe Ugwu, is dead. Ugwu died barely a month after her successor, Chief Patrick Omeje died of heart failure. The eldest brother of Chinwe, Chief Bala Ugwu, confirmed her death to NAN in Nsukka on Saturday. Bala said, “My sister, the former TC Chairman of Nsukka Local Government, died on Saturday morning. “The family of Ugwu at Ozzi Edem in Nsukka LGA has been thrown into serious mourning as a result of this sudden death.” Recall that Chinwe Ugwu was appointed the transition chairman of Nsukka Council on Dec 16, 2019, by Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi.

Jonathan announced his arrival in a tweet on his official Twitter page on Thursday morning. According to him, he arrived in Bamako, Mali’s capital on Wednesday night. He said: “I arrived in Bamako Wednesday evening with my delegation to begin my assignment as leader of @ecowas_cedeao peace mission to Mali. I’m optimistic that our mission will yield positive results. Our message of peace and progress has so far been well received by stakeholders.” DAILY POST had reported that Jonathan was appointed by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) as a special envoy to lead the sub-regional body’s mediation mission in Mali on Tuesday. Jonathan is expected to facilitate dialogue with all principal stakeholders in the West African country, including President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, religious organisations, civil society and opposition leaders, towards resolving the worsening socio-political situation in Mali. Mali has been hit by protests, sparked by the outcome of parliamentary elections in March and April.

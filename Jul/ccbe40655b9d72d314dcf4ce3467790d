Bayern Munich CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, has admitted that Thiago Alcantara wants to leave the club and they will have to sell him this summer. The midfielder has been heavily linked with a departure as his contract expires in 2021. Liverpool has been linked with the midfielder and Jurgen Klopp is believed to be a big fan. Rummenigge has now told Bild that the Bavarians do not want to lose the 29-year-old for anything next year. “He’s a great guy on and off the pitch. We negotiated with him and met all of his wishes. “But he [Thiago Alcantara] wants to leave. It looks like he may want to do something new at the end of his career,” he said.

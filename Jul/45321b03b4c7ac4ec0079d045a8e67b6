Nollywood actor Bolanle Ninalowo has given reasons for converting to Christianity despite born into a staunch Muslim family Ninalowo who was named as Azeez said his system of faith changed after some bad experience. The actor during an Instagram live session said he got into trouble and his parents and family members who were Muslims could not save him. He stated that the bible rescued him at that time from the trouble and since then “it became my life manual.” ” My name is Azeez; I was born into a staunch Muslim family but when I was in trouble and frustrated, it was the bible that saved me, as my parents and family members who were Muslims could not. “So, I picked up the bible and it became my life manual.” He, however, added that he has only been to church once in his life. Addressing the rate at which Nollywood veterans go financially bankrupt, Ninalowo said the actors are to blame and not the government. He said “The blame should not be on Nollywood because it doesn’t have structure, it should be on the individual. You are not a victim of circumstances; you are a victim of the choices you made. A lot of them are carried away. They don’t have retirement plans.”

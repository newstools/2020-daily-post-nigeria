At least, two people â€“ a police inspector and one other person have been kidnapped in a highway operation by men of the underworld in Adamawa State. DAILY POST learnt Tuesday that the inspector and the other victim were passengers of a vehicle plying the Numan-Yola highway Monday night when the suspected kidnappers stopped their vehicle and abducted the two. Sources said the suspected kidnappers who were dressed in military uniform, seized the police inspector, who closed from duty around the Demsa Local Government Area section of the Numan-Yola highway about 60 kilometres south of the state capital, Yola. According to an eyewitness, in the incident, which occurred about 9.30 in the night, the suspects ambushed the Numan Road using big stones and logs to block the road, thereby forcing motorists to stop and swooping on the vehicle conveying the unlucky victims. The witnesses said quite a number of people were abducted, but the State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje said the suspects kidnapped only the police inspector and one other passenger. DSP Nguroje assured that the police had already dispersed their surveillance team and intensified patrol along the route and surrounding bushes to arrest the suspects and free the victims.

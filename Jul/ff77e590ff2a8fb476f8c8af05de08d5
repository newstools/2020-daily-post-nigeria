China, on Friday, announced anti-dumping measures against n-Propanol (NPA) imported from the United States of America. The Ministry of Commerce made the announcement on Friday. It said the domestic industry “has suffered substantial damage due to the dumping of such products by the U.S.” The preliminary ruling was based on an anti-dumping investigation that started in July 2019. Xinhua reports that from Saturday, importers of NPA must pay deposits at rates of between 254.4 per cent and 267.4 per cent at Chinese customs. n-Propanol is used as a solvent in the pharmaceutical industry, mainly for resins and cellulose esters.

Enioluwa Adedayo, aka Judgement, a notorious criminal, has revealed how the Nigeria Police freed him. This was after his arrest for multiple robberies in Lagos and Oyo States. Adedayo, 23, is regarded as one of the most dreaded robbers in Ibadan. Judgement and his gang, with motorcycles, dispossessed victims of valuables at gunpoint. Exposing the level of rot in the Police, Adebayo recalled that officers simply told him to go home. The suspect recounted how he and his squad robbed a man after information that he had money in his house. “We were six men that went for the operation, but didn’t succeed. People chased after us. I broke my leg, was caught and handed over to the police. I spent a month in detention and was released when the pains from my leg worsened”, The Eagle Online quoted him as saying. “The people that brought me to the police station stopped coming. I went home, where my colleagues, Corporal and others, took care of me. Corporal and the gang continued operations and would bring my own share. I rejoined the gang after I got well,” he added. The suspect, it was gathered, allegedly killed victims who refused to follow orders. He started off as a motorcycle thief in 2016 and went into armed thievery in 2018. He has lost count of robberies. Adedayo is with operatives of the Inspector-General of Police Intelligence Response Team, Oyo State annex. The agents, led by Deputy Superintendent of Police, Baba Kaka, started trailing Judgement in March 2020. Adedayo was tracked to his girlfriend’s apartment, where he went to receive treatment for gunshot injuries. He assisted police in the arrest of a gang member, Sunday Olubushe, aka Ajegunle.

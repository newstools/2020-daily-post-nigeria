Barcelona is ready to sell at least twelve (12) players this summer transfer window, as it looks to fund a move for Inter Milan striker, Lautaro Martinez. DAILY POST recalls that Barcelona is eager to sign Martinez this summer. Barcelona’s president, Josep Bartomeu, has already held discussion with Inter Milan over a transfer move for the Argentine international. Barcelona has seen its revenue streams hit hard because of the COVID-19 pandemic and will have less money to spend this summer. According to Marca, Barcelona has put almost half their squad up for sale with Ousmane Dembele and Philippe Coutinho “among 12 players they will listen to offers for this summer.” The report added that not all of them the 12 players will actually leave Camp Nou on a permanent basis, but some could be loaned out. As well as Dembele and Coutinho, the players are Samuel Umtiti, Junior Firpo, Ivan Rakitic, Neto, Nelson Semedo, Arturo Vidal, Martin Braithwaite, Carles Alena, Rafinha Alcantara and Jean-Clair Todibo. Barcelona has already missed out on the 2019/20 LaLiga title to rivals Real Madrid but has kept faith with the manager, Quique Setien, ahead of the resumption of their Champions League campaign next month where they will tackle Napoli at home. The La Liga giants played a 1-1 draw with the Serie A side in the first leg of their last-16 tie on August 8 in Italy.

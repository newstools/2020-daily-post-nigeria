I said okay, no problem. “He informed me that I should come for the money in the night at their office near Sokoto State University, along airport road, Kasarawa Village. I said I didn’t know the office. The 1st defendant said he will wait for me at Sokoto State University gate. After the discussion, I arranged a group of operatives and kept them on standby. “Around 9pm, he sent me a text message that they were already there. In order to test how serious he was, I sent him a text message that he should leave it until tomorrow. He replied that I should come because the money was with them in cash and they didn’t want the money to sleep with them overnight for security reasons. “He said that they were already at the university gate. I said okay, I will get back to them. I called the officers that I arranged for the operation to come and meet me. They came in two vehicles and met me along Airport Road. I told them I will first go, and after 15-20 minutes, they should come and meet me at their office where the money will be given. “Upon our arrival at the office premises, Mr Meng (the 1st defendant) asked me to pack behind a truck that was at the front of a building. Meng said the truck was packed so that the people in the other building would not see what was happening. He brought out keys and opened the door and three of us, including the 2nd defendant entered into a parlour and I was given a seat and we all sat down and I was even offered water. “Mr Meng welcomed me and introduced Mr. Xu Kuai, the 2nd defendant and asked me when they were going to get a clearance? I asked him which clearance? He replied with a clearance certificate showing that they had been cleared by the EFCC. I told him you haven’t finished the job and you were asking for a clearance. He said they will do the job. He now said I should come and see the money. “As we entered, I saw cartons of Sona bottled water filled with cash in Naira. The 1st defendant said, “Alhaji this is your money” I asked how much, “He said its N50 million” I said bring it out and I observed that there are seven cartons. They brought it out to the parlour and in order to gain time for the arrival of my men, I said the money should be counted to confirm it. “I told them to bring out all the money and count it out. The money was counted, it was N50 million and then, we returned it inside the cartons and sellotaped and sealed by the 2nd defendant. They also offered to move the cartons into my car. I agreed but seeing that my men had not still arrived, I decided to sit them down and discuss. “I asked them when they would give me the balance, how long would it take? Mr Meng said very soon but after the lockdown because there are shortages of cash. He again asked about the clearance. I told him to arrange for the balance first. At that stage, we heard a knock on the door. The 1st defendant rushed to the door and I followed him and asked who was knocking on the door. “Mr Meng tried to lock the door, but I pushed him and opened the door. My men came in and arrested the two of them and searched all the rooms and the premises and counted the money under video coverage. During the search, three laptops and documents were recovered. Everything was documented. “We now went with the two defendants, N50 million and the other items recovered during the search and also a black jeep. The N50 million was packed in two denominations of N500 Naira note of N10 million and N1000 naira note of N40 million arranged in seven cartoons of Sona table.” They were identified and tendered by the prosecution through Lawal (PW2). The proceedings were not opposed by the defence counsel, A. T Hassan. The money was tendered and admitted as exhibits by the court. Justice Sifawa adjourned the case to August, 10, 11 and 12, 2020 for the continuation of trial. He ordered that the money be kept in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Sokoto for safekeeping.

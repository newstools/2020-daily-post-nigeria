Former Liverpool captain, Jamie Redknapp, has predicted the Premier League’s top four after Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Leicester City all won this weekend. On Saturday, Manchester United outclassed Bournemouth 5-2, Arsenal claimed a crucial 2-0 win at Wolves and Chelsea bounced back with a 2-0 victory at Watford. The Blues have now moved back up to fourth in the table, two points above United. The top-four race looks set to go down to the wire with nine points separating five teams. Redknapp believes United are in pole position to finish third and expects Chelsea to remain in fourth. He told Sky Sports: “Chelsea’s fixtures certainly look winnable. They’ve got two tricky fixtures – Liverpool away and then Wolves at home could be a big one as well. “Manchester United have got dream fixtures up to Leicester City away. Leicester’s fixtures are difficult. “If you could have anyone’s fixtures there you’d probably choose Manchester United’s right now. “I think Manchester United [are in pole position], looking at those fixtures and with the form, they’re in.”

Former Zamfara State governor, Abdulaziz Yari, has threatened to sue former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode over unwarranted insults at him. FAAN in a statement on Wednesday on its official Twitter page accused the former governor of violating COVID-19 protocols and refusing to allow airport officials disinfect his luggage adding that he is a VIP and should be treated differently. However, Yari in a statement signed by his spokesperson, Mayowa Oluwabiyi, on Thursday denied allegations by FAAN and demanded an immediate apology. The former governor said he obeyed all the COVID-19 safety protocols and is supportive of all steps taken by the Presidential task force to fight the pandemic. “His Excellency Abdulaziz Yari finds the (FAAN) tweet odious and distasteful, he, therefore, demands that FAAN retract the offensive tweet and tender an immediate public apology to him for the falsehood published about his person,” the statement read. Yari further urged Femi Fani-Kayode, to expect to hear from his lawyers over the ‘unwarranted and needlessly vicious attack’ on his Twitter page in reaction to FAAN’s statement on Wednesday. “The vicious attack on the person and reputation of H.E Abdulaziz Yari cannot be winked at,” the statement added. Recall that Fani-Kayode in response to FAAN allegation described Yari as ‘a crooked, corrupt and violent beast’ Fani-Kayode mentioned that if he was the minister of aviation, Yari would have been arrested and banned from flying.

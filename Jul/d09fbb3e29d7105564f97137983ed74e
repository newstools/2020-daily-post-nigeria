Bundesliga club, Borussia Dortmund have told Manchester United that if they want to sign their winger, Jadon Sancho, this summer’s transfer window, a deal must be completed by August 10, according to the German newspaper, BILD. Sancho, 20, is keen on a return to the English Premier League, but Man United and Dortmund remain poles apart on their valuations for the player. Dortmund is demanding over £100 million for Sancho whom they paid Manchester City £8 million for in 2017. Man United remain favourite to agree to a deal for Sancho, but officials behind the scenes at Old Trafford believe Dortmund’s valuation for the England youngster does not sufficiently reflect the costly fallout from the COVID-19 (coronavirus ) pandemic and must be cut substantially if a deal is to be reached between both clubs. Sancho has scored 17 Bundesliga goals and provided 16 assists for Dortmund so far this season. Sancho had also drawn the interest of Chelsea and Liverpool in the past.

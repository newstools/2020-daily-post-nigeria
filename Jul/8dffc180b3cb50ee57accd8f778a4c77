The United States has ordered China to close its consulate in Houston, Texas. According to Ms Morgan Ortagus, the spokesperson for the Department, the order was aimed at protecting American “intellectual property and American private information. “The U.S. will not tolerate the PRC’s (People’s Republic of China) violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people. “This is just as we have not also tolerated the PRC’s unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behaviour,” Ortagus said. Reacting, Chinese foreign ministry’s spokesman, Wang Wenbin, described the development as an “unprecedented escalation” of U.S’ action against China. “The unilateral closure of China’s consulate general in Houston within a short period of time is an unprecedented escalation of its recent actions against China. “We urge the U.S. to immediately revoke this erroneous decision. Should it insist on going down this wrong path, China will react with firm countermeasures,” Wenbin said. He also accused the U.S. government of harassing Chinese diplomats and consular staff members. Wenbin also alleged that the U.S. had also been intimidating, interrogating Chinese students and confiscating their personal electrical devices. NAN reports that trouble started on Tuesday evening when fire broke out at the Chinese consulate in Houston. However, when the first responders arrived, they were denied access into the premises.

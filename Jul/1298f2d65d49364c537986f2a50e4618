Former Liverpool striker, Michael Owen and former Arsenal forward, Charlie Nicholas have predicted the winner of today’s Premier League clash between Tottenham Hotspur and the Gunners. Tottenham head to the match after playing a goalless draw with Bournemouth in the previous game, while Arsenal played a 1-1 draw with Leicester City. Writing in his column for BetVictor, Owen said: “This north London derby is always a feisty affair with seven penalties in the last seven Premier League meetings between the two. “However, without the usual fervent fans, I expect this to be a much tamer encounter, although I do expect goals. “I’m going for a closely fought 2-1 win for Jose Mourinho’s men.” Also reacting, Nicholas wrote in his column for Sky Sports: “This is a game where they will both look at each other and realise they have become average sides. “Harry Kane is always a goal threat against Arsenal, so I would not be surprised if he scored once again. “The back three of Arsenal looked more solid and in control, so for these improvements, alongside Granit Xhaka and Dani Ceballos, Arsenal have looked better. These two are not my favourites, and they are weak defensively as a holding pair, but they have improved on the ball. “Tottenham could raise their game, but Arsenal will be dangerous on the counter-attack. Serge Aurier makes mistakes, and Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will both play as Eddie Nketiah is suspended, but I do think Arsenal could see them off.” The match kick-off time is 4:30 pm.

The Chairman, Yobe State COVID-19 Committee on Prevention and Control has threatened to sack any local government environmental and sanitation committee chairman found violating or showing laxity in the enforcement of coronavirus preventive protocols. Idi Barde Gubana, the Committee’s Chairman and the State Deputy Governor issued the threat when he observed with dismay over non-compliance with the wearing of face mask, social and physical distancing protocols against COVID-19 by most of the chairmen prior to their inauguration on Tuesday. The Deputy Governor, who represented Governor Mai Mala Buni at the inauguration, was furious with the attitude exhibited by some of the committees’ chairmen, noting that their body language was tantamount to ridiculing the ongoing effort by Yobe State Government to halting the spread of coronavirus. “I can suspend this inauguration due to your nonchalant attitude. This shows that Directors Personnel Management of the local government areas are not taking the enforcement of COVID-19 preventive measures serious in their respective areas,” he frowned. Gubana then directed all the Directors of Personal Management of the 17 local government areas to closely monitor and ensure full compliance of preventive measures in their respective areas, stressing that the State COVID-19 Committee will not condone such nonchalant attitude. According to Gubana, it is expedient for everyone in the state to observe all measures put in place by federal government meant to curtail the spread of the virus and that the state committee will ensure a strict compliance of the measures across the state. “We must abide by the federal government’s rules with respect to COVID-19 prevention and control measures,” he urged.

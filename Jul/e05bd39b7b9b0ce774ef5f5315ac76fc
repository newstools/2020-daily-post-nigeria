Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has insisted a Liverpool player will win this year’s English Premier League Player of the 2019/2020 season ahead of any of his players. The annual Professional Footballers’ Association, PFA, Awards would have been scheduled to take place on April 26, but have naturally been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But Guardiola believes the accolades will inevitably go to one of Liverpool’s players since their captain, Jordan Henderson, has already won the Football Writers’ player of the year award. Asked who should win the award, Guardiola told the BBC: “It will be won by a Liverpool player. “When we won the Premier Leagues it was won by a Liverpool player. “When they win the Premier League I’m pretty sure they are going to win the player of the season, so this award is always for Liverpool.”

Manchester United has a “huge worry” ahead of their Premier League clash with Leicester City on Sunday because of how Mason Greenwood, Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Bruno Fernandes performed against West Ham United. This claim was made by the Liverpool legend, Steve Nicol. Recall that Man United played a 1-1 draw with West Ham at Old Trafford on Wednesday. Mason Greenwood scored the goal for United, but the 18-year-old, Rashford, Martial and Fernandes were not on top form for the host against the Hammers. Asked about the four players, Nicol told ESPN FC that it would be a concern for Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, that his front four lacked energy. “I think from a Man United point of view [the performances of those four] would be a worry,” Nicol said on ESPN FC. “He left players out of the semi-final of the FA Cup so that they would have legs for this game. “And if there was one thing that you can say about this game it’s Man United looked flat, they didn’t look like they had any energy and that makes no sense considering the team that played in the semi-final of the cup. “So that’s a huge worry for United going into this Leicester game.”

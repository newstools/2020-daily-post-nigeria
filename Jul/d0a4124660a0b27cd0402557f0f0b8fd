The Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calabar, Prof Zana Akpagu has decried the poor infrastructural development in Northern Cross River State. The VC lamented the situation in Calabar on Thursday when 196 Councillorship candidates of the All Progressives Congress under the aegis of Forum of APC Councillorship Candidates visited him. “The Ogoja province is one of the oldest in the country yet still very underdeveloped. There’s a complete absence of federal presence in the north and when I sit back, I ask myself whether some Senators who are attracting so many federal projects to their constituencies are serving in different Senate from our own Senators”. Akpagu said he was overwhelmed by the show of love and support he was getting from critical Stakeholders in the party, noting that the ground is very fertile for the APC to take over the senatorial district in preparation for the state takeover in 2023. He maintained that he was very excited to identify with the people because they are the ones who are closer to the people. Leadership should be about people and not one’s self. Each time I get the opportunity to serve, I always strive to better the lots of the people. I know that along the line we make mistakes as mortals but our record doesn’t show that we’ve done badly at all. As a party we’ve missed so many opportunities because of the crisis, we shouldn’t allow the issues deny us this golden opportunity again which promises to strengthen our resolve to take over the state from PDP in 2023″. Earlier, the Coordinator of the forum, Effiom Yellow-Duke said the forum has sent a delegation to the National Secretariat detailing how the party can resolve the impending crisis and “we’re charging you today to lead the process”. While appealing to APC leaders in the state to always put the interest of the party ahead of their personal interests, he tasked the senatorial hopeful to do everything within his reach to bring the warring factions together.

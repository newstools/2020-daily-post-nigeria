Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest update on N’Golo Kante and Willian ahead of his side’s FA Cup final clash with Arsenal on Saturday evening at Wembley. He also confirmed that Ruben Loftus-Cheek would miss Chelsea’s fixture against the Gunners after the England star sustained a minor injury. Recall that Kante sustained a tight hamstring during Chelsea’s 3-0 win against Watford a few weeks ago, while Willian has been surrounded with contract worries in the past few days. However, speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday, Lampard said both Kante and Willian would be in the Chelsea squad to face Mikel Arteta’s men. “N’Golo Kante and Willian are in the squad. Loftus-Cheek has a small problem and is out of the game,” Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying. He added: “Yeah, [Willian, has given everything despite contract worry], because I have known him for many years, and his mentality has shown since the restart. He has given everything.” Chelsea head to the game after beating Wolves 2-0 on the final day of the 2019/20 Premier League season at Stamford Bridge last Sunday. The kick-off time for the match between Arsenal vs Chelsea is at 5: 30 pm.

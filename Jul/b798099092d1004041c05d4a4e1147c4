Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, is demanding a new deal worth £250,000-a-week to remain at the club, ESPN reports. The Gabon international has also requested a minimum three-year contract. Aubameyang has entered the last year of his current deal with the Gunners and the club is eager to tie him down to fresh terms. This week, he broke Thierry Henry’s goalscoring record at Arsenal. Aubameyang scored twice as they hammered Norwich City 4-0 at the Emirates on Wednesday night. He has now scored 51 times in just 79 appearances. The 31-year-old moved to the Premier League side in a £56million move from Borussia Dortmund in 2018.

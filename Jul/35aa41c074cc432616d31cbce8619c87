Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the All Progressives Congress Party (APC) governorship candidate in Edo State, has condemned the latest comment against him by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Recalling comments by Ize-Iyamu and ousted APC national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, the PDP declared that the flagbearer was unfit to succeed Governor Godwin Obaseki. Ize-Iyamu described the position as empty, revisionist, and a narrative to deceitfully test the intelligence of Edo people. A statement on Tuesday by his campaign spokesman, John Mayaki, said PDP was engaging in deliberate conflation of facts. He said the PDP twisted facts and misrepresented happenings of yesteryears to look like a recent happening. Mayaki stated that there was no interview or confession to any crime or wrongdoing.” The media aide noted that the PDP “in one of its character traits of misinformation, shamelessly exhumed and republished an old video in which Ize-Iyamu was making a clarification of several allegations.” He said those who watched the video, with no bias or malice, described Ize-Iyamu as an honest and upright man who tried to put facts in their proper perspective. Mayaki accused PDP of turning a blind eye to reason and “embarked on a misguided mission to muddle things up”. “Rather than achieve their desired damage, the video helped the public see the trajectory of this happenstance and the unscrupulous nature of the divided PDP.” Mayaki expressed regret that “the same PDP that supported Ize-Iyamu’s aspiration in 2016, the same year that the said video interview was granted, republished the same video with a twisted narrative.”

The Nigeria Union of Journalists NUJ, Kano Council has called on the State Government to urgently promulgate a law with stiffer penalties against rapists. The union during its monthly congress drew the attention of the state government on the alarming rate of rape and other related offenses and urged the state government to generate new laws to punish perpetrators of acts. In a Communiqu√© signed by the Chairman of the Council Abbas Ibrahim and Secretary Abbas Murtala, the Council said that only a severe penalty against rapists could stop the act. The Union also called on the state government to hurriedly address the challenge of an acute shortage of pipe-borne water supply, especially in the metropolis. The union bemoans the resurfacing of the activities of street urchins, who now pose a severe danger to the lives and property of residents, calling on the state to re-strategize the functional capacity of vigilantes and overall community policing across the state. The NUJ congress said the Kano State government must adopt proactive measures to confront the foreseen threat posed by flooding to ensure food security and other properties. The body raised alarm on the unending issue of Almajiri confronting the state and asked the state government to match its words with actions. Abbas implored the state government and relevant security organs operating in the state to squarely confront the menace of reckless driving and overloading of commercial transports, which poses danger to the lives of residents in the state. The congress further called on farmers in the state to access the agro intervention programmes provided by both the state and federal governments, calling on the media to sensitize the Kano populace on how to register to benefit from the ongoing registration.

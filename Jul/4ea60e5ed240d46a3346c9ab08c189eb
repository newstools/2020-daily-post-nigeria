Real Madrid has opened a four-gap ahead of Barcelona at the top of LaLiga table. This follows a 1-0 victory over Getafe at the Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium on Thursday night. Vinicius Junior had the best chance for the hosts in the first half, but his toe-poke was pushed away by goalkeeper David Soria. The breakthrough came in the second half when Dani Carvajal was fouled inside the penalty area. Sergio Ramos stepped up and calmly converted the spot-kick with 11 minutes left. Madrid now has 74 points after 33 matches, while Barca has 70. The result means that Madrid, who has not won the title since 2017, has now recorded 17 clean sheets in the league so far, their most in a single campaign since 1994/1995.

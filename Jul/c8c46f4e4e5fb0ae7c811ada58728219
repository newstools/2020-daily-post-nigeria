The former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has said the screening committee of the party relied on documents from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to disqualify Governor Godwin Obaseki when they took him to court in 2016. Oshiomhole stated this on Thursday when he was addressing a crowd of supporters, who welcomed him to Benin City, the Edo State capital. According to him, the lawsuit instituted by the PDP was struck out because the party filed out of time. Oshiomhole claims APC learned from what happened in Bayelsa State and decided to repeat the mistake in Edo State. He said: “PDP took Obaseki to the court that he forged certificate. “You know what happened to us in Bayelsa. So I need to assure you that the decision of the screening committee to disqualify the sitting governor was based on the evidence provided by PDP which they found to be correct and you do not repeat the same mistake twice.” Obaseki will contest the Edo governorship poll under PDP after he was disqualified from the APC primaries.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, says some operators of tourism businesses are helping some Nigerians launder money. On Friday, the agency appealed to the practitioners in South-East, not to engage in such. EFCC lamented the rate of non-compliance with extant anti-money laundering regulations for Designated Non-Financial Institutions. Enugu Zonal Head, Ibrahim Bappa, spoke on Friday while addressing executive members of Society of Tourism Proprietors of Nigeria (STPN), Enugu State Chapter. The officials were at the commission’s Enugu office at the instance of the Special Control Unit Against Money Laundering (SCUML). Bappa said the EFCC has noted, “the indifferent attitude of some of you with regards to your obligations to stem the incidences of money laundering and terrorist financing in the South-east which has been the least compliant zone in this regard”. He warned the operators of dire consequences. Bappa noted that their compliance with the required protocols was not only necessary for the success of their businesses but a patriotic duty that will preserve the country’s economy and image. Head of SCUML in the zone, Tijani Kabo also expressed displeasure with the lackadaisical attitude of operators. Kabo said the EFCC has gone into an enforcement mode, having consistently warned operators not only to register with the agency but to comply with all the operating requirements. He said these include conducting proper ‘Know Your Customer’ checks on clients and reporting of suspicious transactions. Kabo said anyone who flouts the law faces fines that range from N1 million to N25 million.

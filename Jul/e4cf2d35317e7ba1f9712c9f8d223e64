Chelsea defender, Andreas Christensen, has revealed that the entire squad is “excited” about the club signing Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech. Christensen, speaking to the club’s official website, also backed both forwards to thrive at Stamford Bridge. The Blues agreed a deal with Ajax to sign Ziyech in March, while Werner secured his move to west London last month. Ziyech and Werner are Frank Lampard’s first and second signings as Chelsea manager and officially joined the Premier League club today, July 1. Christensen face Werner several times during his spell in Germany and says he is more than aware of the striker’s talent. “I played against Werner quite a few times when I was in Germany so I know what he can do and what sort of player he is. “I haven’t played against Ziyech but I’ve seen him a lot and I think they can both bring good things to the club. “We’re all excited to see what they can bring,” he said. —

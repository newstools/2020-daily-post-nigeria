Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, will prefer a transfer move to Premier League champions, Liverpool than Manchester United. Sancho, who joined the German Bundesliga club for just £8 million, is ready to return to England after three years in Germany. Man United were very much at the front of the queue to sign Sancho, with the 20-year-old apparently keen to return to the city he used to live. The Red Devils have been in hot pursuit for Sancho all season, and have been linked with a £100million transfer for the England international. However, According to the German newspaper, Kicker, Sancho reportedly believes Liverpool have a greater chance of winning silverware next season than Man United. The England international is now having second thoughts about signing for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this summer despite the fact that United qualified for next season’s Champions League. DAILY POST recalls that this is coming less than 48 hours after Dortmund rejected Man United’s opening offer of £89million for Sancho. Dortmund are holding out for a £109.3 million transfer fee for Sancho, who scored 20 goals and provided 20 assists in 44 appearances for the club this season.

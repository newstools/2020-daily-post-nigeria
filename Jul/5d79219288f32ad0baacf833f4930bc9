Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, on Monday, said that the former Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Joy Nunieh, did not participate in the one year service of the National Youth Service Corps. Akpabio said this during questioning by lawmakers at the House of Representatives Committee investigative hearing on financial mismanagement in the NDDC. He also disclosed that Nunieh had at several occasions shunned meetings. “The former Managing Director of the NDDC was relieved of her appointment when I received a letter from the then Chief of Staff (may his soul rest in peace) that she did not possess the requisite qualifications to be there. “She shunned meetings maybe because she earns more than the minister. Nunieh also does not possess NYSC exemption letter. “We wrote twice to the National Youth Service Corps and they insisted that Nunieh never served and that she does not have an NYSC certificate or an exception.” Akpabio added that insubordination also led to Nunieh’s sack.

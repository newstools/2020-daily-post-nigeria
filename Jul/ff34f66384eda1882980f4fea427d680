Shehu Sani, a former Nigerian lawmaker, has dropped some words of advice to haters of popular reality show, Big Brother Naija. The 2020 season of Big Brother Naija, themed ‘BBNaija Lockdown’ which kicked off on July 19, has received a wide range of criticism. Most recently, the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, while urging political office holders and other stakeholders to discourage immoral activities, had particularly kicked against the ongoing reality show, describing it as evil. CAN called on well-meaning Nigerians to join in the protest against the show. It argued that the immorality being portrayed in the BBNaija show should be vehemently condemned because it breeds evil. However, Sani, who represented Kaduna central senatorial district in the 8th Assembly advised that it was better to stay away from the channels showing the programme than to condemn and attack after watching. “Some elders approach to #BBNaija is to watch and attack, watch and condemn instead of not to watch at all,” he advised in a tweet on Sunday afternoon.

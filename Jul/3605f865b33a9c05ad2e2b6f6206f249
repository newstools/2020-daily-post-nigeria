Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Wednesday, ordered the interim forfeiture of 48 choice properties, linked to former Chairman of Nigerian Social Insurance Trust Funds (NSITF), Ngozi Olejeme. The properties are in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, Bayelsa, Enugu, Edo and Delta States. The forfeiture order was granted after counsel to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ekele Iheanacho, convinced the court that the properties were purchased with proceeds of crime. He buttressed his position with 14 exhibits, attached to his affidavit, filed on May 29, 2020. Justice Taiwo ruled that the interim order be published in a leading newspaper within seven days of receipt of the order. He gave any interested party to, within 14 days, show cause why the properties should not be permanently forfeited to the federal government. He adjourned the matter till July 27, 2020. Olejeme, Treasurer of the Jonathan-Sambo Campaign Organisation in 2015, has been on the run since 2016. In September 2017, she was declared wanted by the EFCC for criminal conspiracy, abuse of oï¬ƒce, diversion of public funds and money laundering. Olejeme was alleged to have along with Umar Munir Abubakar, former NSITF Managing Director, mismanaged and diverted over N69billion. The amount was allegedly found in accounts link to them after the award of spurious contracts to proxy companies.

Security forces stationed at Gomari Kirikiri and Dalori area of Maiduguri, the Borno State capital on Sunday exchanged gunfire with suspected Boko Haram fighters at about 12 midnight. Residents of the area and sources within the military confirmed that the exchange of fire between the security forces and Boko Haram lasted for over an hour until the militants withdrew. A security source, not authorised to speak, told DAILY POST that they have been battling the criminals, especially at the outskirts, in many locations to stop insurgents from making an inroad to Maiduguri. “I think Maiduguri is a target for the past two weeks. We have been repelling attacks almost at all of our locations.” He said. On the exchange of fire between the soldiers and insurgents on Sunday night he did not comment. But residents of Dalori in Maiduguri said, military vehicles have evacuated a soldier, who was injured during the exchange of fire.

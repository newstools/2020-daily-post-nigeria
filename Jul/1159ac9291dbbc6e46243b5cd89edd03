Noel Donjur, the Chief of Staff to Plateau Governor, Simon Lalong, has tested negative for coronavirus. He had tested positive a fortnight ago and went into isolation in line with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols. Information Commisioner, Dan Manjang, made the announcement on Saturday in a statement. He said the Health Commissioner, Ndam Lar, confirmed Donjur’s new status. The government wished him sustainable good health and “gives God the glory for showing him great mercy”. Lar was quoted as appealing to the people to go for testing as the administration had taken over the bills and treatment those positive. He urged civil servants to avail themselves for the tests and warned that those infected but avoiding treatment would be forcefully isolated. Lar cited reports of workers circumventing the exercise. He described the behavior as an affront and an act of disrespect to authority. “The Head of Service has been duly directed to deal with the matter administratively and that will include sending such recalcitrant staff to an isolation centre for the stipulated period of 14 days”, he added.

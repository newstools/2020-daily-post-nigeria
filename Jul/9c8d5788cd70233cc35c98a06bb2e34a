A Court of Appeal, sitting in Ado-Ekiti in Ekiti on Thursday affirmed the judgment of a High Court in the state, which sentenced one Temitope Aina to life in imprisonment. Aina was sentenced to life imprisonment by Justice Ayo Daramola of the State High Court on Aug. 22, 2016. Our Correspondent reports that the convict committed the crime in Ado-Ekiti. Dissatisfied with the judgment of the high court, the convict approached the Appellate Court, seeking to upturn the decision of the trial court. The Director of Public Prosecution, DPP, from the Ministry of Justice, Mr Julius Ajibare, who led the prosecution team argued that the case lacked merit. The judge, Justice Obi Elechiu, however, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. “Having listened to the arguments from both the prosecution and the defence counsels, the court of appeal upholds the judgment of the lower court and dismisses the convict’s appeal for lack of merit,’’ the judge stated.

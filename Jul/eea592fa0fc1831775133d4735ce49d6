A truck allegedly belonging to Dangote Cement Company has been set ablaze in Lokoja, the Kogi State capital. This follows the killing of a father and injuring one of his sons while the other escaped being crushed. An eyewitness account told our correspondent that the empty truck was about negotiating the bend leading to Zone 8 roundabout when it lost control and crushed a pedestrian who was standing by the roadside with his two sons. While the middle-aged man was crushed alongside one of his sons who was badly injured, luck smiled on the other one who escaped unhurt. It was gathered that onlookers who witnessed the incident constituted themselves into a mob to attack the truck and set it ablaze. The state police command while confirming the incident said the truck lost control at the zone 8 roundabout and crushed a pedestrian and injured one other person who is currently receiving treatment at the hospital. The Police Public Relations Officer, William Aya who spoke to our correspondent on phone said that the incident made the people of the area to take the law into their hands and set the truck ablaze. He, however, confirmed the death of one person while the identity of the injured son could not be ascertained. He said that he was receiving medical attention in the hospital while a full scale investigation into the matter has commenced.

Oshiomhole has defined the governor as a politician and Oshiomhole has also defined the pastor as a politician. Without me saying it, Oshiomhole has helped us to say who is popular and who should be voted. “Oshiomhole has always said that Obaseki is the best among these two in terms of qualification and doing the will of the people. He is number one and he has always told us that the second man, Ize-Iyamu is a thief. I can tell you Oshiomhole is proud of me. ‘’I am keeping the tenets of what we believe. Comrade Adams Oshiohmole told us that Godwin Obaseki is a team player and member of the family. He told us Obaseki knows the tradition of the family. I also know the tradition of the family. “What is the tradition of the family? Say no to godfatherism, say yes to development. That is the tradition of the family. Our project has become the people’s project. It is not just our project but the Nigerian project because of the victimization we suffered. “I am excited. I am happy that I am doing the will of my people. I am happy that the decisions taken so far are decisions that are blessed by my people. I am happy that I have not disappointed them.’’

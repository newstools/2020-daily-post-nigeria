Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire, has slammed the Red Devils players following their 2-2 draw with Southampton in the Premier League on Monday night. Marcus Rashford had cancelled out Stuart Armstrong’s early goal before Anthony Martial put Man United 2-1 up. Michael Obafemi scored in the 96th minute at Old Trafford to ensure Chelsea and Leicester City remain in the final two UEFA Champions League spots. But Maguires believes Man United players weren’t good enough on the ball against the Saints, adding that they gave the visitors a soft goal. “We’re disappointed. We got control of the game, and we had numerous chances to kill the game off,” Maguire said after the game as quoted by Daily Star. “We weren’t at our best. We did enough to win the game, and a set-play has killed us in the end. “We gave them a soft goal. We weren’t good enough on the ball. We gave the ball away far too much as a team, everyone in the team. “We have to dust ourselves down. We have some big games coming up, where we have to go for the three points.” Maguire will hope to lead Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side when they take on Crystal Palace on Thursday in their next fixture.

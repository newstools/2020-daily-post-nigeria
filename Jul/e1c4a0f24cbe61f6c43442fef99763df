Physically challenged persons in Fika local government area in Yobe State have lamented the noninclusion of their members in government’s empowerment initiative meant to create economic opportunities for people in the area. They expressed their displeasure while speaking to our correspondent at an event organized to empower 30 APC officials from 10 electoral wards of the local government, held at the local government’s Secretariat in Fika town. A physically challenged, Hassan Baba said “we have been loyal to APC as a party since from the beginning, but when it comes to the issue of economic empowerment; nobody considers us. “We know the state government is trying when it comes to empowering of youth as many have benefited from one from empowerment program or the other. We want our members to be included in all initiatives and programs meant to have value on the lives of people in the area. Another physically challenged, Jibrin Mohammed added that there are over 5,000 special needs persons in Fika local government that need to be empowered for self-reliance. “Failure by the government to empower our members is one of the causative factors compelling most of us to embark on street begging as we have families to take care of. Our children are there without education and job to do. “We struggle every day to survive. We need special consideration”, stated. Mohammed appealed to the authorities concerned to look into their plights with a view to ameliorating them. 10 tricycles, 10 sewing machines and 10 grinding machines were presented to APC ward chairmen, women leaders and youth chairmen from 10 electoral wards that formed Fika local government area by the State Deputy Governor, Idi Barde Gubana, a gesture under the Buni and Gubana Youth Empowerment Initiative.

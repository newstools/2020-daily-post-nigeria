Sequel to the COVID-19 status of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, his deputy, Agboola Ajayi has urged his boss to do the needful by handing over to him as acting governor. On June 30, Akeredolu had begun self-isolation after he was confirmed COVID-19 positive insisting that he will still be treating and attending to files. Ajayi, who gave his boss 21 days ultimatum, stated that Akeredolu’s COVID-19 status, which returned positive was an indication that he is incapacitated. Akeredolu had on Friday described his deputy as a threat to governance in the state emphasizing that Ajayi no longer belongs to the APC and governance in the state stressing that it is a non issue that he should handover governance to Ajayi. Recall that on June 21, 2020, Ajayi left the APC following months of frosty relationship with his boss, after which he picked the membership card of the PDP. Shortly after his resignation from APC, the Deputy Governor disclosed that he will not resign from office, stressing that the people who gave him the mandate did not ask him to resign as deputy governor. According to the deputy governor who spoke through his Media Adviser, Allen Sowore emphasized that “it should be noted, that Mr Governor is at liberty to handover or not within 21 days after which the constitution becomes operational. “Ostensibly, the refusal and failure of Mr Governor to handover the running of government to his deputy while he is temporarily incapacitated in self-isolation underscore his absolute disregard for our nation’s supreme document, 1999 Constitution (as amended) as well as the tenets of rule of law. The Governor’s position is a spite on the Ondo State people and a direct assault on the provisions of the constitution which he swore to uphold.”

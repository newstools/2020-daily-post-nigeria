Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has congratulated his Bayelsa counterpart, Governor Douye Diri, on his victory at the Supreme Court. A statement on Tuesday by his spokesman, Olisa Ifeajika, said by the judgment, the Supreme Court had put to rest all contending issues on the governorship election. The apex court concluded the legal battle on the governor’s candidacy on the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) platform. Timi Alaibe challenged the emergence of Diri as the candidate in the election. The governor pointed out that the victory was for all parties, urging Alaibe, to sheathe his sword, as the future was still bright for him. He urged the Bayelsa governor to reach out to all concerned, in order to have an all-inclusive government. Okowa appealed to Alaibe and all other contenders, to join hands with the governor to develop Bayelsa to truly be ‘the glory of all lands’. “It is only when leaders work together with same goal in mind that the state can accelerate its development.” Okowa said the judgement of the apex court was a victory for the nation’s democracy and a reaffirmation of the supremacy of the party in handling its internal issues. He commended the judges at the apex court for refusing to delve into the matter. The ruling will go a long way in restoring the hope and confidence of Nigerian people on the sanctity of the judiciary, Okowa added

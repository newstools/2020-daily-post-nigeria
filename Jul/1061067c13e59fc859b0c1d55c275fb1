The embattled Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi on Sunday demanded the resignation of the Speaker of the Ondo State House of Assembly, Hon. Bamidele Oleyelogun. Ajayi who stated that the Speaker risks removal from office if he failed to resign stressed that Oleyelogun’s role in the failed purported plan to impeach him as deputy governor has brought disrepute to the revered legislative arm of government. While lauding the Chief Judge of Ondo State, Justice Olarenwaju Akeredolu, for adhering to the provisions of the Nigerian constitution during the impeachment saga, Ajayi stated that the Chief Judge’s action has rekindled confidence and hope of the people in the judiciary. Recall that on Thursday, Justice Akeredolu had declined the request of the Speaker to set up a probe panel against the deputy governor following allegations of gross misconduct. 14 out of 26 members of the Assembly had signed impeachment notice against Ajayi with nine lawmakers distancing themselves from the plot to impeach the deputy governor. According to Ajayi who spoke through his Media Adviser, Comrade Allen Sowore in a statement, decision of the Chief Judge on the “illegal and fraudulent move by a section of the Ondo State House of Assembly” is a triumph for the rule of law against “brigandage and anarchy”. The deputy governor added that the resignation or the removal of the Speaker “whose incompetence has brought the exalted parliament into disrepute” will go a long way to preserve democratic gains, restore the dignity of the legislature and the principle of separation of power.

The Commissioner of Police, Ebonyi State Command, CP Philip Maku, on Wednesday, confirmed the killing of four gallant police officers by armed robbers at Ezzangbo junction, in Ohaukwu LGA of the state. CP Maku said the officers accompanied a bullion van, which was coming from Enugu to Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital. He noted that two other police officers equally sustained serious bullet injuries. DAILY POST gathered that the robbers targeted the police officers first before opening fire on the bullion van. It was also learnt that the robbers attempted to intercept the bullion van at busy junction where the state government is currently building flyovers. The robbers in a bid to intercept the van and cart away the money, first fired at the escort van carrying the Policemen before hitting on the bullion van tire. CP Maku said that the robbers trailed the van from Enugu State. He said that the robbers were not able to loot the van as the driver managed to drive the van out of the area. According to him: “They damaged one of the tires of the bullion van but the driver was able to escape with the van. They could chase the van as the driver was driving towards the military checkpoint ahead,” he said. The CP said the two injured Policemen have been taken to hospital for treatment while the deceased have been deposited at the mortuary. Mr. Maku said the Police have launched a manhunt for the fleeing robbers. .

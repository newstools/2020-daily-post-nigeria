Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest injury update on forward, Christian Pulisic and defender, Andreas Christensen, ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against West Ham United tonight. The Blues head to the game after defeating Leicester City in the FA Cup in their previous fixture. “Christian felt a bit of tightness in his calf when he came off against Leicester,” Lampard said as quoted by Chelsea’s official website. “We are managing him. I have not got an answer for him yet. “He feels better than he did at the end of the game, so we will see on Wednesday. “Andreas Christensen likewise is in the squad, but we will have to see for another 24 hours because of the tight turnaround.” The game is scheduled at 8: 15 pm.

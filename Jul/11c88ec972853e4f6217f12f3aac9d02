A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos, Mr Joe Igbokwe, has given reasons why the Peoples Democratic Party stands no chance of winning the state in 2023 and beyond. Igbokwe, Special Adviser to Gov. Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Drainage Services, made the assertion while speaking with newsmen on Thursday in Lagos. He said PDP had been completely uprooted from the state, adding that there was no way a “dead party “could dislodge the APC in the state. Igbokwe said the APC was the choice of Lagosians and that the ruling party, even if having internal schisms, would defeat PDP “again and again”. “PDP can never win Lagos in 2023. Are they still in existence? No, they have been uprooted. Everybody has left them. “Their State Chairman left them, and he is now in APC. He said since he left the PDP, his house has been a beehive of activities. “He was in the dark, and he has seen the light. No internal problems in APC will make PDP win Lagos,” he said

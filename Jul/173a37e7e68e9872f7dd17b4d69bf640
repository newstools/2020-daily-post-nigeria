Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC), Adamawa Command, has arrested the leader of the Shila criminal gang, Michael Linus. Nuradeen Abdullahi, the Commandant in the state, paraded the suspect on Tuesday in Yola. He recalled how Linus terrorized the people of Adamawa. “Michael Linus, 22, specializes in Shila criminal activities, recruiting minors into criminal activities and sale of hard drugs. From records available, the suspect inflicted injuries on many innocent people.” Also in custody is Ibrahim Mohammed, 33, NAN reports. He visited government schools in villages and presented himself as a contractor. Mohammed deceived villagers that he would replace their schools’ old roofing sheets with new ones but ended up selling them. Also arrested was Mustapha Ismail, a suspected notorious car-snatcher and thief. Luck ran out of him when he was nabbed committing the crime; the car was recovered. Abdullahi added that five others were arrested in connection with various crimes that included cybercrime, theft, and housebreaking. “Investigation is ongoing to unravel other perpetrators and, on completion, they will be charged to court for prosecution,” he said.

Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has said that he was hoping on God for victory at the ongoing primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC). DAILY POST reported earlier that three of the aspirants have already stepped down for the incumbent Governor. Akeredolu addressed journalists before the commencement of accreditation, adding that he never wanted to be involved in complaints by some aspirants that they were not aware of the delegate list. He said the list is well-known to all party members since the ruling party came into existence. “I never wanted to be involved in all the complaints because I know that a farmer goes to farm with implements. The farmer only complains when he is not ready,” he said. “In the APC, we know those who have been delegates over the years since APC came to be. “We all know who the delegates are. I know the God I serve, He will do me well and all plans will fall in place.”

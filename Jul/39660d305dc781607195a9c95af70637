A Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt has restrained Nigeria Police and other Law enforcement agencies from arresting the former Acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, Joi Nunieh. The court presided over by Justice S.E Thompson also granted an ex-parte order, restraining the NDDC and others from arresting Nunieh, pending the determination of the matter in court. Nunieh sought the orders of Court through her counsel, Sylvester Adaka, the immediate past Chairman of the Nigeria Bar Association, Port Harcourt Branch. Joi Nunieh, appointed into the NDDC in October 2019 and sacked February 2020 has been involved in a series of controversy over her short stint at the Commission which she blamed on the Minister of Niger-Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio. She demanded the arrest of and prosecution of Akpabio by the Police, accusing the Minister of oath-taking, sexual harassment, fraud and corruption at the NDDC. Joi Nunieh is currently taking refuge at the River State Government House Port Harcourt after being rescued by Governor Nyesom Wike from Police arrest.

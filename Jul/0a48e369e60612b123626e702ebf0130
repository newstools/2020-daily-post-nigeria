The Jigawa State Judiciary has canceled its long 2019/2020 annual Judges vacation scheduled to start 13th July 2020. This was contained in a legal notice No.5 of 2020, signed by the state chief of Judges and Chairman, Judicial Service Commission, Jigawa State Hon. Aminu Sabo Ringim and obtained by DAILY POST. He said the decision followed the prolonged stay at home by the Honourable Judges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Sabo explained that looking at the volume of pending cases, the state Judiciary canceled the long vacation to clear its backlogs courts and decongest some correctional facilities. The Chief Judge, however, stated the cancellation is in line with the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) and other laws. “With the power bestowed upon me by the provision of 274 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, on that behalf I hereby cancel the long vacation earlier scheduled to commence on the July 13th to September 11 2020”.

The Board of Projects Development Institute (PRODA), Enugu, has recommended the suspension of the Director-General, Charles Agulanna. He was ordered to step aside over alleged misconduct and financial indiscipline. The board took the decision at its quarterly meeting after establishing a prima facie evidence against the Agulanna. This was after the establishment of a case against him following a query on March 2, 2020. The meeting was chaired by board chairman, Daniel Onjeh. Agulanna was indicted for alleged misappropriation of funds, prolonged absence from duty without leave, nepotism, corruption and insubordination. He was also accused of suppression of vital information, sabotage, among others. “The letter recommending the suspension of the DG was forwarded to the Ministry of Science and Technology for necessary action as the parent ministry and was signed by Onjeh, Prof. Mohammed Mu’azu, Hon. Diran Ayanbeku, Hon. Gabriel Akpan and Mr. Anpe Fut,” a source told NAN. The suspension of the DG for six months was in line with Chapter 3, Section 4 and Subsection 030406, of the Public Service Rules. It was also in compliance with the circular issued by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) with Ref. No: SGF/OP/I.S.3/T/163 and dated May 19. The board’s Establishments Committee was directed to investigate the allegations against the Agulanna and to submit its report within six months. Last week, some PRODA staff raised the alarm that some vital documents were carted away by persons allegedly sent by certain top officials.

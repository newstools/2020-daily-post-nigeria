Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said they did not deserve the three points, after a late equaliser from Michael Obafemi gave Southampton a 2-2 draw on Monday. Marcus Rashford had cancelled out Stuart Armstrong’s early opener, before Anthony Martial put United 2-1 up. However, Obafemi struck late to ensure the points were shared at Old Trafford. The result means Solskjaer’s men stayed in fifth instead of going third on the Premier League table. “You think you have three points in the bag but we probably didn’t deserve three points today. “Southampton are a good team, they run, and run and chase. We never got into our rhythm today. We played some fantastic football at times. The two goals we scored were very, very good. “It was the worst time to concede a goal but it happens in football. We have won so many games in that way. It is all part of the learning for this team,” Solskjaer told the media afterwards.

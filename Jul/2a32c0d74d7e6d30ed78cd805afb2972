German Army has disclosed that its dogs were receiving training to sniff out coronavirus infections. The country’s number of cases could hit 200,000 in a few days. On Monday, the military said it is working with the University of Veterinary Medicine in Hanover to train 10 dogs, Dpa reports. The alsatians, spaniels and retrievers belong to Bundeswehr’s dog training site in the rural Western region of Vulkaneifel. The training school said with a current success rate of around 80 percent, the researchers would continue the project. Dogs are used to search for explosives, drugs; they also detect various cancers and low blood sugar levels in diabetic people. Also on Monday, Robert Koch Institute for Disease Control said the daily rise in infections stood at 219. “Among those who have tested positive for the virus, some 182,200 people are estimated to have recovered, while 9,016 people have died”, it said.

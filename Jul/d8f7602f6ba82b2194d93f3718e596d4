A two-year-old girl has allegedly been raped at a COVID-19 isolation ward in South Africa. According to News24, the toddler was admitted at Dr. George Mukhari Academic Hospital in Pretoria after developing symptoms of COVID-19. It was learned that the victim’s mother who had left the hospital after receiving information that the child needed to be placed in an isolation ward was later contacted that the child was crying and appeared to be in pain. It was later discovered that the minor had tested negative for the disease but had been raped at the isolation ward. Narrating the incident, the victim’s aunt said, “The nurses at the clinic said since the child was struggling to breathe, she should be taken to George Mukhari Hospital to be tested for coronavirus. ”The hospital called in the evening and told the mother that the child was crying and in pain. They later called around 11pm and said the child was now sleeping. The hospital staff called again in the morning and told my sister to come and pick up her child because she had been discharged. The hospital said the child had tested negative for COVID-19.” The aunt explained that when the child was picked up she appeared to be struggling to walk. ”I saw that there was something wrong with the child. As the mother was changing the nappy, she discovered some white fluid on her private parts. “She initially thought it was medication as the child had been in hospital. But the following day, that same whitish fluid was still coming out. “When the mother closely inspected her child she could see that there had been ‘penetration’.” The victim was, however, taken back to the hospital and it was confirmed that the child had been raped. Confirming the incident to News24, the Provincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Mathapelo Peters said a rape case had been opened.

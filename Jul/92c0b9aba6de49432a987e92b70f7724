He said: “With a great sense of responsibility and unbroken faith in the future of Ondo State, I announce my formal withdrawal from the governorship race, having been an aspirant under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. “My exit from the contest is predicated on circumstances beyond my control as history is my witness as I withdraw from the governorship race. “From the activities of the present administration and disposition of the people, it is clear that the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State has failed to meet the expectations of the people.” He said

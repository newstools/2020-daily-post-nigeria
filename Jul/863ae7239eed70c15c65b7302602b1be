The All Progressives Congress (APC) Chieftains who asked an FCT High Court, Jabi, to stop Adams Oshiomhole from parading himself as the National Chairman, have withdrawn the suit. The suit was instituted by Mustapha Salihu, APC Vice Chairman (North-East). Joined as a plaintiff was Anselm Ojezua, a factional party chairman in Edo. Respondents were APC, the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) and the Department of State Services (DSS). Their counsel, Oluwole Afolabi, had filed an ex-parte motion upon which the court suspended Oshiomhole. The Court of Appeal later affirmed the suspension. On Thursday, Afolabi informed Justice Danlami Senchi that he had filed a Motion on Notice to discontinue the suit on July 1st. Afolabi told the court that the motion was brought in pursuant to Order 24, in line with High Court Proceedings Rule ( 2018). The respondents’ counsel, Ginika Ezeoke, did not oppose the application made by Afolabi. The lawyer, however, urged the court to dismiss the suit with a cost of N100,000. But Afolabi stated that the suit was not being withdrawn because it lacked merit but because the APC directed party members to withdraw all pending matters before courts. Senchi, in the ruling, granted the application to discontinue this suit. “The application is hereby granted. The suit is hereby dismissed. Parties are to bear their respective cost,” he ruled.

A former Manchester United and Arsenal striker, Robin van Persie, has named three players that he feels should make the three-man final shortlist for this year’s Ballon d’Or award. BT Sport on Wednesday night asked their Twitter followers to name their three nominees for the 2020 Ballon d’ Or, and Van Persie got in on the act by submitting three names. Van Persie snubbed Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and Juventus’ Cristiano Ronaldo and instead went for Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski, Manchester City’s Kevin De Bruyne and Liverpool’s Sadio Mane – in that order. He tweeted: “@lewy_official, @DeBruyneKev@Sadio Mane.” Lewandowski has been in great form for Bayern this season. The Polish striker has scored 52 goals in 43 appearances in all competitions, helping Bayern to win the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal while they are still in contention for the Champions League next month. De Bruyne has scored 11 goals and registered 18 assists for Manchester City in the Premier League this season. The Belgium international helped Pep Guardiola’s side to win the League Cup, qualify for the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the Champions League last 16. Mane helped to end Liverpool’s 30-year Premier League title drought by scoring 16 times and registering seven assists. The Senegalese international also won the Club World Cup, but Jurgen Klopp’s men are not in contention for any more trophies this season.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, claimed Manchester United received “help” from referees, who awarded them penalties. Mourinho was speaking against the backdrop of his side being denied a spot-kick during a 0-0 draw at Bournemouth on Thursday night. He refused to blame himself or his players after Spurs were frustrated by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) for the second time within a week in the Premier League. The goalless draw means Tottenham have scored only five goals since the restart, but Mourinho was quick to defend his attackers at his press conference on Friday. Asked about Spurs’ toothless attack compared to United’s, Mourinho responded: “United’s 13 penalties is a help. It’s a help!” United equalled the all-time record for penalties awarded in a single Premier League season, as they were handed their 13th spot-kick of the season away at Villa Park.

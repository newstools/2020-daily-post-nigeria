The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Friday urged Christians to stand up against Jihadist soldiers plotting to Islamize Nigeria. IPOB made the call while condemning the attacks on some Southeast indigents by Fulani herdsmen. The group urged politicians in the Southeast to rise up and defend their land. A statement by IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful said Fulanis are taking over the country. According to IPOB: “We are calling on Jude-Christians in Nigeria to stand up against the upcoming jihadist soldiers scattered all over Nigeria to Islamize the country. “The country is clearly coming to an end, Christians must not allow Islam to humiliate them again in Nigeria. All politicians in Biafraland must come out and defend their land because Fulani has taken over, we are aware of the humiliation of past politicians like Late Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe and others because they were out to defend their people British colonialists humiliated them. “Today Fulani people are humiliating politicians who are ready to defend their people especially politicians from Biafraland. “We are informing all Christian nations and organizations across the globe to know how Nigeria’s government and her partners in crime are killing Biafrans and other Christians in Nigeria. Before we match all these nations and organizations must be aware of the caliphate plans to eliminate Christians in the north and Biafra land.”

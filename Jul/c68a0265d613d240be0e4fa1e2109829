UEFA do not consider Manchester City’s Champions League tie with Real Madrid to be in jeopardy, despite one of the LaLiga club’s players testing positive for COVID-19, the UK Mirror reports. Madrid striker, Mariano Diaz, is unavailable for the second leg of the last-16 tie at the Etihad Stadium next week Friday, after beginning a two-week period of quarantine. Diaz, who has made only seven substitute appearances this season, is understood to have tested positive on his return from holiday, following Real’s title triumph. The 26-year-old is believed not to have been in physical contact with other squad members in the past week, although tests are due to be carried out in the coming days. City, who hold a 2-1 lead from the first leg of the tie, don’t have major concerns over the development. But if more Real players test positive in their next round of testing, that could ultimately throw the tie into serious doubt.

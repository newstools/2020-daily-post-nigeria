Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said that Spurs thrashed Leicester City 3-0 on Sunday in the Premier League because his team were strategically good against the Foxes. He also hailed Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, for doing an amazing job at King Power. Mourinho’s side defeated Leicester City, thanks to James Justin’s own goal and a brace from Harry Kane. The victory means Tottenham are now in the sixth position on the Premier League table with 58 points after 37 games, while Leicester is in the fourth position with 62 points. “I think we were strategically good. We knew what worked for us,” Mourinho told Sky Sports. “Brendan Rodgers did an amazing job since he arrived, but at this moment he is in a little bit of trouble with injuries. I know what it is because I had similar problems at the other end. “He is trying to compensate for the people he lost, so we knew that in transition we could win the game. We tried to be very fast after recovering the ball. “We did that very well in the first half, and in the second half, it was about being compact and getting the result. “You always need your goalkeeper to make a couple of important saves which he did, but we were phenomenal. They had a lot of corners, and we defended well. I felt very comfortable in the game.”

The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Oyo State Command, has arrested a 29-year-old, suspect over alleged kidnapping and murder. The suspect was arrested after the police received a tip-off from commercial motorcycle riders around the area. The command’s Public Relations Officer (PRO), Olufemi Adetunji, disclosed this to newsmen on Friday, at the NIS office, Agodi-Gate, Ibadan, while handing over the suspect to the police command in the state. The suspect whose identity was not revealed in an interview with NAN confessed that he was not only involved in duping, but also in Kidnapping and selling of human parts to ritualists. He confessed that he enticed children with biscuits on the streets and lured them into their cars. The suspect, a resident of Beere, Oje area in Ibadan was a member of a gang of nine, comprised of two females and seven males that carry out operations. He added that he had killed at least two children, and sold their parts to suspected ritualists. “We have a car which we use for kidnapping. We buy biscuits and other things and keep them in the car, which we used to entice the children. “Anytime we see little children walking on the road unaccompanied by an adult, we entice them with biscuits and quickly put them in the car and zoom off. “We later kill the kidnapped children and sell their parts to the ritualists,” he added.

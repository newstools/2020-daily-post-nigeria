Engineer Rauf Olaniyan, Deputy Governor to Engineer Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and two commissioners in the state have been prevented from attending the eight (8) day Fidau prayer (prayer for deceased) for the immediate past Governor of Oyo State, Senator Abiola Ajimobi. DAILY POST recalls that Ajimobi who died in Lagos was buried last Sunday at his Oluyole Ibadan residence. Our correspondent recalls that both the state government led by Makinde and Ajimobi’s family had been at loggerheads since the demise of Makinde’s predecessor. But, a delegation of Oyo State government led by Olaniyan, Barristers Abiodun Abdul-Raheem and Seun Ashamu, commissioners for land and energy respectively were turned back from entering the Oluyole residence of Ajimobi, venue of the 8th day Fidau prayer for the deceased. Security details attached to the venue were said to have resisted their efforts to enter the venue, as they almost engaged in open confrontation with security details attached to Olaniyan. Olaniyan, Abdul-Raheem and Ashamu, left after making frantic calls to people believed to be close to the family. Omolere Omoetan, Senior Special Assistant on Media to the Deputy Governor confirmed the development to DAILY POST. Omoetan in a conversation with DAILY POST on Sunday, said, “Very correct. He was not allowed in. Security details at the gate said, ” Madam is with the key to the gate”.

Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, wants Barcelona captain Lionel Messi to remain in La Liga amid speculation of a possible departure. The 33-year-old is contracted to Barca until 2021, but there are fresh speculations he might leave next year. According to Cadena SER, Messi has suspended contract negotiations due to his frustrations with Barca, who look set to lose their league crown to Real this season. Zidane was asked about the rumours regarding Messi after Madrid moved four points clear of Barca thanks to a 1-0 win over Getafe on Thursday. “I don’t know what will happen but we hope not because he is in this league and we want the best in this league,” Zidane told reporters. Sergio Ramos netted the only goal for Los Blancos from the penalty spot, as they sealed their sixth win in a row with five games left.

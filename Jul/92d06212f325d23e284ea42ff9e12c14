Residents of Magumeri Local Government Area of Borno State on Thursday said that militants invaded their community, carted away valuables, rustled cows and withdrew without challenge. According to the residents, the insurgents stormed the community around 7:30 pm and left at about 10:00 pm. Suleiman Modu, a resident of Magumeri who spoke to DAILY POST said the insurgents did not attack the people. “They only asked our people to give them all the valuables, and they also took away their cows. I spoke with one of my cousins who informed me that 20 of his cattle were among the over one hundred and fifty rustled cows,” Suleiman said. According to the residents, the situation is frightening and calls for government actions as many residents now live in fear daily.

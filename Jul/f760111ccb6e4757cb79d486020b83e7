The Chief Judge of Kaduna State, Muhammad Lawal Bello, has disclosed that the state records about 15 cases of rape every day. Lamenting the alarming rate of rape cases in the state, he said that most of the victims are within the ages of three months and twelve years of age. Speaking at the annual Law week organized by the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, Kaduna branch on Monday, he expressed anger at the discovery of the corpse of a six-year-old rape victim in a Mosque in Kaduna. The Chief Judge lamented that rape crimes are on the increase in the country, stressing that Kaduna is no exception as it records between 10 to 15 cases daily. He added, “The situation is becoming rampant that victims are mostly little boys and girls within the ages of three months to 12 years old.” He observed that the COVID-19 pandemic has forced the judicial system to improvise in ensuring that cases do not linger in Courts, saying that the state government has acquired the necessary equipment for Court hearings to be held online. He explained that serious cases that may lead to imprisonment, life imprisonment and death sentences would be exempted as a witness needs to appear physically to avoid the presentation to fake witnesses. The state NBA chairman, Samson Audu, enjoined the government to introduce modern technology to meet up the new challenges faced by the judicial sector.

Pastor of Household of God Church International Ministries, Chris Okotie says conducting services online is not scriptural. Most churches all over the world adopted online services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and in a bid to abide by the social distancing guidelines. But, Okotie in a message he titled ‘The COVID-19 Mystery’ said that God is not interested in computers and prefers an assembly of Christians. He made reference to the bible verse talking about not forsaking the assembly of the saints. Okotie said “God knows where you are; if He was not interested in the assembly, you don’t need to come to church; you can pray in your house. “I pray in my house. You praise in your house. I praise in my house. He can see all of us. He doesn’t need computers. According to him, forsaking the assembly of his people denies God of who he is. “Conducting services online denies God of who He is; so, we must not forsake the assembly of yourselves together, that’s why the bible puts that verse as an imperative,” Okotie added. Recall that Okotie accused the owner of Microsoft, Bill Gates, of leading a conspiracy to destabilize the global economy and carry out a “satanic agenda” against the church.

The police on Thursday, arraigned a 45-year-old woman, Janet Olaoye, before an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court over attempted murder. The prosecutor, Insp. Caleb Leramo, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on March 18 in Ilupeju Ekiti. He alleged that the defendant attempted to murder one Mrs Rebecca Ebo. Leramo said that the defendant and the complainant had a misunderstanding and the defendant hit the complainant on the head with a plank which resulted in serious injury. According to him, the offence contravened Section 320 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. The prosecutor urged the court to remand the defendant in the correctional centre pending legal advice from the office of Director of Public Prosecution (DPP). The plea of the defendant was not taken, as his counsel, Mr Stephen Olumuagu applied for his bail with a promise that she would not jump bail. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Abdulhamid Lawal, consequently granted bail to the defendant in the sum of N100,000 with two sureties in like sum. He later adjourned the case until Aug. 25 for mention.

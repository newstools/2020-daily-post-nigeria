Former Barcelona captain, Xavi Hernandez, has tested positive for COVID-19. The 40-year-old who is currently Al-Sadd manager, confirmed this via an Instagram post today. According to him, he is feeling okay but is self-isolating. As a result,  Xavi will miss the Qatar Stars League game against Al Khor on Saturday. “Today I won’t be able to join my team on their comeback to the official competition. “David Prats will be there on my behalf as head of the technical staff – coach to the Al-Sadd reserves. A few days ago, following the Qatar Stars League protocol, I tested positive in the last COVID-19 test,” part of the statement read.

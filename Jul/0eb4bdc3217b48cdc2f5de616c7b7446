The chairman of Imo State Covid-19 taskforce, Prof. Maurice Iwu has warned some security agents in the state allegedly collecting money from citizens who violate Covid-19 directives, to desist from such or be charged for criminal act. Iwu said that the taskforce had in no time given such order, appealing that such activity be stopped forthwith. “It has come to our notice that certain individuals, groups and touts have been going round the state extorting money from citizens of the state in the guise that they are members of Imo Covid-19 taskforce. “Let me make categorically clear that there is no time Imo Covid-19 taskforce directed anyone, group or organization to overtly or covertly embark on any action to enforce the rules by collecting money from any individual, group or company in the state. “The taskforce uses this medium to inform the citizens of Imo state not to allow anyone in the guise of Imo Covid-19 taskforce to dupe or extort you of your hard earned money. We did not in a any way authorize this act,” he warned. Prof Iwu spoke through a press release made available to newsmen. The release, however, advised Imo people to continue to keep to the rules of the containment of Covid-19 spread, reminding citizens of the continuous use of facemasks and washing of hands with running water or hand sanitizer.

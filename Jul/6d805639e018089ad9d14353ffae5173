The All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Bola Tinubu, says he is saddened by the death of Inuwa Abdulkadir, former National Vice-Chairman (North-West) of the party. In a statement by his media office on Monday, Tinubu described Abdulkadir as a prominent legal luminary, who served Sokoto State, Nigeria and the legal profession to the best of his abilities. The former Lagos governor said the deceased was a friend and associate who contributed to the political merger that led to the creation of APC and the progress of the party. Tinubu commiserated with members of his immediate and extended family, particularly his wife and children. He mourned with his political and professional associates, particularly members of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA). Tinubu also sent condolences to Sa’ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto and former governor, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko. “To Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and the government and people of the state, I offer my sympathy and commiserations,” he noted. While praying for Almighty Allah to comfort Abdulkadir’s everyone, he beseeched Him to accept the soul of the deceased.

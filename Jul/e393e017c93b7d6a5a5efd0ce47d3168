Aisha Yesufu, co-convener of BringBackOurGirls, BBOG, advocacy group has mocked President Muhammadu Buhari over his trip to Mali. Aisha Yesufu said Buhari has become a ‘travel blogger’, who enjoys hopping around the world. She made the remark while berating Buhari for travelling to Mali while there are issues of insecurity back home in Nigeria. The activist, who spoke via a video on her Facebook page, said the President should have known that leaving for Mali is the least expectation of Nigerians who look up to him for result-driven leadership. She said: “Our travel blogger is back in business as he has jetted out to Mali. Anything that will make him be on the plane and anything that has to do with travelling outside the country, President Muhammadu Buhari will do it. “He is there to talk about the political situation, unrest and everything in the Francophone country. Meanwhile, his country is boiling, his country has practically fallen but that doesn’t concern President Buhari. “All that concerns him is an opportunity to stand on the steps of the Presidential plane and wave. They are already sending the pictures to us and that is all that matters!” The BBOG co-convener lamented that Buhari was more concerned about the perk of office than ensuring the security of Nigerians. She said: “The Commander-in-Chief that is not concerned that Boko Haram insurgents have just murdered some Nigerians whose lives and properties he is supposed to protect and it doesn’t matter that citizens are being killed every day. It doesn’t matter that security agents are being killed all over Nigeria. “His being a President is to enjoy the perks of office and never to take any responsibility. “Do you remember those aid workers taken by Boko Haram and so many Nigerians that have been executed? They send gruesome videos hoping that can shock Buhari but they are mistaken.”

Disturbed by the recent incessant killings in parts of Southern Kaduna, thousands of women on Thursday took to the streets naked, to register their displeasure over alleged attempts to eliminate them from their ancestral lands. Some of the protesting women wore black cloths with patches of black all over their bodies in a protest that terminated at the palace of Atak Njei, Agwamatyap Palace (the Paramount ruler of Atyap) in Zangon Kataf local government area of Kaduna state. Recall that of recent, there have been killings in Zangon Kataf and Kaura local government areas by suspected Fulani militias resulting in the loss of lives, burning of houses, foodstuffs and rustling of animals. The protesting women noted that the continued killings have taken away their breadwinners, parents, sisters, brothers, husbands and children, stressing that majority of them are widows, widower and orphans. They explained that as a result of the incessant killings, their farmlands have equally been taken over by their attackers who have denied them access. The women, who beside protesting naked, cried and rolled on the ground demanding justice for their loved ones who have been killed and maimed, as well as the burning of their houses and destruction of their food sources. The recent attacks are coming after the imposition of a 24-hour curfew in Zangon Kataf and Kauru local government areas following the unrest of 10th and 11th June 2020 aftermath of the alleged killing of a 32-year-old farmer in his farm. The protesting women called on constituted authorities, security agencies and the international community to come to their aid to avert further killings and destruction of properties in the area.

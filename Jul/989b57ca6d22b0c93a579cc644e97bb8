Aisha Ahman Pategi, Kwara State Commissioner for Special Duties, on Monday, dismissed claims of alleged N300m illegally deducted from the state’s local governments’ accounts. Addressing newsmen in Ilorin, the Commissioner explained that “the malicious rumours were formed by the figment of bloggers’ imagination.” She warned”those peddling the fake stories to desist or be ready to face the full wrath of the law.” Aisha, was the former Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs at the inception of Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq’s administration until the recent minor cabinet reshuffle by the governor. She denied ever making any pronouncement that such amount was deducted from the local governments’ accounts while serving as the commissioner of the former ministry. “I debunk claims about the N300m misappropriation of local governments’ funds. I never made such pronouncement nor did I ask anyone to write or say anything like that on my behalf. Aisha, however, lamented that what the founding fathers built had been left to ruin and deteriorate, adding that, she was happy “that nature had made it possible and given her the opportunity to serve Kwara State and Kwarans by changing the narrative. She said ” this administration is now on the path of governance, not campaign, not politics as usual. “We are here to deliver the mandate given to us by Kwarans. I, therefore, urge the general public to disregard the financial misappropriation information as rumours,” she further stated.

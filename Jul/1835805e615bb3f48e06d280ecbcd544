Manchester United have reportedly agreed to a four-year deal with Real Madrid youngster, Alvaro Fernandez Carreras. According to Spanish newspaper, AS, Fernandez will become Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjear’s first summer signing at the end of the season. Fernandez’s contract at the Santiago Bernabeu expired on June 30. He played the left-back position for Real Madrid’s Juvenil C team this season. The 17-year-old was linked with a host of top European clubs, including Manchester City. But Man United have now won the race for Fernandez’s signature. Fernandez will predominantly play for United’s youth team but he has been told there may be first-team opportunities should any injuries arise to Brandon Williams or Luke Shaw

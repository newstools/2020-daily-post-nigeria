The Federal Government has disclosed that telecommunication data will crash by 40 percent in the next five years. Isa Pantami, the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy disclosed this while speaking at the opening ceremony of digital skills training for ICT journalists, in Abuja. Pantami said the government’s new five-year broadband plan would raise broadband penetration in the country to 70% in five years. He said the government was also working to ensure that at least 80 million Nigerians have access to broadband internet by 2025. “And this means a hundred more jobs will be created across the country. “With all these the telecom operators will no longer give excuses and we’ll now ensure that prices of data come down by 40% by 2025”, he said.

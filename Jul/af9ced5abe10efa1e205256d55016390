Chelsea has qualified for the final of this year’s FA Cup, following a 3-1 win over Manchester United on Sunday. The Blues who had lost all previous three games to United this season, took the lead after Olivier Giroud’s near-post flick was fumbled into the net by goalkeeper David de Gea. De Gea was also at fault for the second goal, as he failed to keep out Mason Mount’s effort from range. Harry Maguire’s own goal completed a woeful defensive performance for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men. The Red Devils pulled one back from the penalty spot after Anthony Martial was fouled inside the box by Callum Hudson-Odoi. Chelsea will now play London rivals in the final on August 1. The Gunners shocked Manchester City 2-0 in their semi-final clash yesterday.

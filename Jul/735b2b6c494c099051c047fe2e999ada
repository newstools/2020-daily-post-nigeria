The Police Command in Ondo State has said it deployed 800 personnel to monitor the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governorship primaries in the state. The Police Public Relations Officer in the state, ASP Tee-Leo Ikoro, made this public while speaking with newsmen at the venue of the primary election in Akure on Wednesday. According to him, the police personnel were sent to the election to ensure a peaceful exercise. “We have secured the whole place, as we did during the APC governorship primary election on Monday to ensure that there is no problem throughout the election. “Right here, we have about 800 personnel and also have other sister agencies to support in ensuring that the place is fully secured. “We are also optimistic that there won’t be any foul play this time around because all politicians are aware that today is for election and not to cause any unwarranted issues. “We have also advised the voters to vote and leave the premises and if they have any support to give to their candidate, they can do that after leaving this place,” he said. NAN reports that as at 10:30 am, activities at the venue had not commenced, although the Chairman of the Ondo PDP Primary Committee, Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State was already at the venue.

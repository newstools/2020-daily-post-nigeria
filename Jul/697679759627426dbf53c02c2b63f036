The Adamawa State Police Command on Wednesday paraded 19 people for alleged rape and four others for alleged homosexual acts. Fourteen of the 19 rape suspects allegedly raped people in different incidents while five were paraded as members of a nine-member syndicate that gang-raped a woman. The Adamawa State Police Commissioner, CP Olubenga Adeyanju, who addressed newsmen at the Police headquarters in Yola where the suspects were paraded, said they were arrested from across the state for sexual assault against women and children. The 14 who were identified with various rape cases across the state are aged between 16 and 45 years. The oldest, 45-year-old Sani Muhammed, said in an interview with newsmen Wednesday morning that he was arrested after he raped a seven-year-old girl. He said he is married with children, including two teenage daughters. Of the five others paraded for rape-related cases, one is a 30-year-old woman, Zainab Jafaru, who is charged with ‘criminal conspiracy, rape and abatement’ and accused of trapping her friend into the hands of eight men who raped her. She was arrested and paraded Wednesday with four of the men, while four other men were said to still be at large. The police commissioner who narrated how the incident happened, said, “On the 12/062020, at 1000hrs, the fifth suspect, Zainab Jafaru, deceived 33-year-old victim who happened to be her friend to accompany her to Geiro, a certain place situated in a remote side of Jambutu, Yola North LGA, to see her boyfriend. “Unknown to the victim, it was an organised crime planned against her. On arrival, the gang leader named Uda SNU invited his syndicate numbering nine, who immediately arrived and applied force on the victim and had sexual intercourse with her one after another. “Investigation led to the arrest of five out of the nine while efforts are on to locate the fleeing suspects.”

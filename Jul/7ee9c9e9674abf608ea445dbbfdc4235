Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has explained why he did not feature goalkeeper, Kepa Arizzabalaga, in his side’s Premier League final day 2-0 victory against Wolves on Sunday evening at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea defeated Wolves at Stamford Bridge Stadium, thanks to two goals from Mason Mount and Olivier Giroud. Kepa, who featured in Chelsea’s 5-3 defeat to Liverpool last Wednesday, was forced to watch from the bench as veteran goalkeeper, Willy Caballero, featured ahead of the Spain international. But Lampard is now saying that he did not play Kepa against Wolves because he felt Caballero’s confidence has improved after the Argentine keeper featured in Blues’ FA Cup semi-final 3-1 victory against Manchester United some days ago. When asked why he started Caballero ahead of Kepa, Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying after the game: “I have long hard thought about everything, but how we are as a team. “Clean sheets are not just a reflection of the team. “I don’t want to pinpoint it on Kepa, I felt like Caballero with his confidence from Man United was important.”

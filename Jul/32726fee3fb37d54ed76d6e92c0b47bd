Former Liverpool striker, Peter Crouch, has named Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United as the three clubs that will challenge Jurgen Klopp’s men for the Premier League title next season. Liverpool was crowned Premier League champions for the first time in 30 years last in June after Manchester City’s 2-1 loss against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Speaking on the team that can contest with Liverpool for next season’s Premier League title, Crouch told Daily Mail: “It may sound obvious, but the threat from Manchester City will be huge. “I saw John Stones said Man City’s dressing room still believes they have been the best team this season and I can understand why he said it — the way they attack is just beautiful to watch. “But Stones is wrong. Liverpool is deservedly 23 points clear, and I think that gap gives you an idea of the magnitude of their achievement. “They’ll be the team to beat again next season, as they have got the world’s best goalkeeper, defender and 3 sublime strikers. “The gap will close over the 12 next months. Chelsea will be exciting, and I am eager to see how Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner bed in. “I am watching Manchester United at the moment and, my God, how good does Mason Greenwood look? “Rio Ferdinand had been telling us about Greenwood for quite a while but to see him sparkle has been one of the highlights of the restart. “There is plenty to get excited about next season — but Liverpool remains the team to beat.”

Manchester United defender, Eric Bailly, has provided the latest update on his head injury ahead of the Red Devils’ Premier League clash with West Ham United on Wednesday evening. The Ivory Coast international sustained the injury during Man United’s Emirates FA Cup semi-final 3-1 defeat to Chelsea. Baily started the match at Wembley Stadium as part of a back three, but unfortunately had to leave the field shortly before the half-time break. Providing an update, Bailly wrote on Twitter: “Thank you for all the messages of support. “I am ok, it was just a scare. I feel the pain of yesterday’s defeat even more. But we have to get back up and refocus on the two big games we have this week.”

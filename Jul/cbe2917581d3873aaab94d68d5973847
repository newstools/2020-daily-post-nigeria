The Plateau State Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Abe Aku, has rested positive for coronavirus. The state governor, Simon Lalong, disclosed this through the State Commissioner for Information and Communication, Hon. Dan Manjang, in Jos, the state capital. Consequently, Governor Lalong directed all members of the State Executive Council to undergo test for dreaded virus and thereafter isolate beginning from today, July 1, 2020. He said, “Plateau State Governor, Simon Bako Lalong has directed members of the State Executive Council to undergo test for COVID-19 and thereafter isolate beginning today, 1st July, 2020. “This follows the fact that a member of the State Executive Council and Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Abe Aku, tested positive for the virus after he carried out the test. According to him, “Based on the governor’s directive, specimens of the commissioners are to be taken and forwarded to the COVID-19 Laboratory at The National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), Vom for testing. “During the period and pending the outcome of the results, members of the public are advised to be guided by unnecessary visits to members of the State Executive Council while they isolate,” he maintained. “This action is to not only prevent the possible spread of the disease, but also show leadership by example.” DAILY POST recalls that, at the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic about three months ago, Governor Lalong and his family carried out the test and all tested negative.

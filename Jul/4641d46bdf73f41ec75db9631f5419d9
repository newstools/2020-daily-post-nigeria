Real Madrid head coach, on Sunday, said that he was fed up of hearing that his team was only winning La Liga matches because of a refereeing decision. He also warned that nobody would shift Real Madrid’s focus from winning the La Liga title this season ahead of Barcelona. Zidane said this following the Los Blancos’ 1-0 win against Athletic Bilbao in the La Liga on Sunday afternoon, thanks to Sergio Ramos’ second-half penalty goal. “I have not seen a replay, but I am fed up hearing that we are only winning because of refereeing decisions,” Zidane was quoted by Managing Madrid as saying at his post-match press conference. “The players deserve respect. Nobody is going to shift our focus away from our goal. Until somebody mathematically wins the league, we will not relax.” He added: “I really liked our defensive solidity. We’re showing that we’re strong even when we don’t have the ball. “We’re doing well in that sense. Maybe we lacked some sparkle in the attack, and we can improve on that, but our defensive solidity is important.” Real Madrid’s next La Liga clash is against Alaves on Friday.

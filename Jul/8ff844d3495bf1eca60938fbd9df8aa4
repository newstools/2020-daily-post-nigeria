Former England international, Glenn Hoddle, has given reasons why Manchester United striker, Mason Greenwood will push teammate, Marcus Rashford out of the team. Hoddle believes Rashford will lose his Man United spot to Greenwood because the 18-year-old will become a far better finisher than the 22-year-old. Greenwood netted twice in Man United’s 5-2 win against Bournemouth on Saturday to take his tally for the season to 15 goals. He also surpassed Cristiano Ronaldo’s goal-scoring record at the club. “I think Mason Greenwood is a wonderful player now and he’s only going to get better and better,” Hoddle told Premier League Productions. “I am really impressed with the two feet. I love to see players play with two feet. He has got the right foot, and he has got a left foot. “I think he’ll push Marcus Rashford out of the team. There’s a quote. I think he’ll end up being a far better clinical finisher and, in the end, I think you are going to have to put this lad in first ahead of anyone else.” “Their front three at the moment is working really well for them, [But] When you look at Martial and Rashford they are all wingers really; they want to play wide.” —

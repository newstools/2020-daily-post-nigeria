Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has blamed the “office referee” following their 3-1 defeat at Sheffield United on Thursday. Harry Kane’s goal was canceled, after Sander Berge had given the hosts the lead at Bramall Lane. VAR officials ruled that Lucas Moura had used his arm in the build-up, despite the Brazilian being pushed over. Mourinho looked angry at the time, but the Portuguese refused to blame referee Chris Kavanagh. “I think the referee should always be the man on the pitch and the man in the office should support and assist. But that’s not the way that it is. “Especially a referee who’s not very good on the pitch, we can’t expect him to be very good in the office. “I used to go to the fourth [official] but the man on the pitch is the assistant referee and today the man and the lady with the flag, [who] used to be the assistant referees, are now assistant’s assistant. The ref is in the office,” Mourinho said on Sky Sports. The result is a blow for Spurs’ European hopes, as they are now ninth on the Premier League table with 45 points.

Barcelona have congratulated bitter rivals Real Madrid for winning the 2019/2020 LaLiga title. Zinedine Zidane’s men beat Villarreal 2-1 on Thursday night, while the Catalans lost 2-1 at home to Osasuna. The results saw Real open a seven-gap between themselves and Barca, with one round of matches left. Barcelona have taken to their Twitter handle to congratulate Madrid for securing their 34th domestic crown. “Congratulations to Real Madrid on winning the 2019/20 La Liga title,” the tweet read. Karim Benzema netted a double including a penalty at an empty Alfredo di Stefano Stadium, to ensure Los Blancos end their two-year wait for a domestic title.

Itse Sagay, Chairman, Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC), has told President Muhammadu Buhari to dissolve the current board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. Professor Sagay made this call when he appeared on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Tuesday, asking for fresh members to be injected into the board. This is in view of allegations and counter allegations of corruption rocking the commission. “I will suggest that everybody there should be cleared out and the President should not appoint a new set of people very quickly under temporary conditions so that a permanent board and management can be established in the place that will then be monitored. “My view is that everybody should be removed right now. Clear the place, sweep it clean. Start afresh with a new set of people,” he said. Sagay described the allegations coming from the Commission as mind-boggling, wondering why forensic auditing cannot be done despite having a regular board manning the affairs of the commission. He recalled that he was against the character of two nominees when some appointments were made into the commission. Recall that the 2019 budget defence of the Commission by the agency’s Interim Management Committee (IMC) suffered a setback. The acting Managing Director, MD, of the NDDC IMC, Professor Kemebradikumo Pondei and the Executive Director (Project), Dr Cairo Ojougboh, among others appeared before the National Assembly in Abuja during the week but could not successfully defend the agency’s 2019 budget as the lawmakers pointed out some discrepancies in the budget.

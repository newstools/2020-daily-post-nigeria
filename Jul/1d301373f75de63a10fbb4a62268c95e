Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez, has conceded the LaLiga title to rivals, Real Madrid, by confessing that it is now almost impossible for the Blaugrana to catch Zinedine Zidane’s men. The Uruguay international also claimed that Barcelona’s 2-2 draw against Celta Vigo cost them to lose their great opportunity to be in a better position to win the La Liga title. Barcelona is currently four points behind Real Madrid, with just two matches of the season remaining, and it would take a miracle to prevent the Los Blancos from winning their first title since 2016/17. “If you have to be honest, the league is almost impossible,” Suarez told Diario Sport. “It is clear that the game against Sevilla [a goalless draw] is a game that makes things very difficult for you. We had options to get ahead. “That day was important, but in Vigo [a 2-2 draw] it was key. We lost our great opportunity. “If we had beaten Celta, we would have been better off against Atletico. The blow was in Vigo, the goal in the last minute from [Iago] Aspas. It hurt. “Now we have to finish well and go for the Champions League.”

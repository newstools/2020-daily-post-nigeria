Former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, has sent warm felicitations to the Nigerian Muslim Ummah on the occasion of Eid-El-Kabir, urging them to pray for the peace, unity, and security of the nation. In a statement he made available to DAILY POST in Abuja, he called on the Federal Government to take immediate steps to end the killings in the country, warning that Nigeria was fast becoming a killing field. Ekweremadu stated these in his Sallah message to the Muslim faithful on Thursday. “I felicitate with our Muslim brothers and sisters on this occasion of Eid-El-Kabir. The occasion calls for rededication to the fine principles of sacrifice, justice, and equity as exemplified by the Prophet and without which no nation can ever make any progress. “It is also not lost on us that this is a very dire time for Nigeria, as our Muslim brethren and the nation celebrate Sallah in a state of grave apprehension, with many of them displaced by the worsening insecurity. This Sallah, therefore, serves as an opportunity to offer special prayers for the peace, unity, prosperity, and security of our country. “I equally call on the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari, to take every necessary and urgent step to arrest this parlous situation where Boko Haram and allied insurgents, bandits, criminal aliens, kidnappers, and all manners of predatory elements have field days killing civilians and even men of the armed forces alike without corresponding or greater consequences”, he said. Ekweremadu wished the Nigerians a happy Sallah celebration, charging them also to stay safe, observing the protocols and guidelines for preventing the spread of COVID-19.

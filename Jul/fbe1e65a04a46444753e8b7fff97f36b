Father of the Kwara State governor, Abdulganiyu Folorunsho Abdulrazaq, SAN, was buried according to Islamic injunctions in Ilorin on Saturday. His remains were committed to mother earth after the Asr 4 p.m Muslim prayers under a low key janazat ritual at his ancestral home, Idi-Igba quarters, Pakata, in Ilorin West Local Government Area of the state. Present at the burial were his children and grandchildren. Among eminent personalities who stormed Ilorin for the burial rites were the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon Femi Gbajabiamila, Governor Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi State, and Governor Mai Mala of Yobe state. Also in attendance was Hon James Biodun Faleke among others. DAILY POST reports that the eldest son of the Abdulrazaq family, Dr Alimi Abdulrazaq had pleaded with members of the public “to respect the wishes of the family to make the burial rites strictly a family affair because of the current mood of the world which calls for physical distancing.” “Given his stature, as a national icon, and a man of the people, the family understands that many people may want to witness the historic moment of his burial rites.” Dr Alimi stated. Meanwhile, prominent citizens of the state and country have been sending their conference messages to the governor’s family describing the late statesman as an enigmatic and accomplished personality. Former governors Bukola Saraki and Abdulfatah Ahmed described his death as a great loss not only to the Ilorin Emirate, and Kwara State, but to the country in general.

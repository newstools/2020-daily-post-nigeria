The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has said he was not in a position to regulate the prices of tickets for airlines. Sirika stated this on Thursday, when he appeared before the Senate Committee on Aviation, to brief the lawmakers on the level of preparedness for flight resumption on July 8. “Price is not in my hand but from what we put in place, I do not think that anything significant will happen to affect the propensity to fly,” he said. Sirika, however, assured that necessary protocols have been put in place, to ensure physical distancing within the airport and inside the aircraft. Abuja and Lagos airports will reopen on Wednesday, July 8, while those in Kano, Port Harcourt, Maiduguri and Owerri will resume operations three days after. There is no date for the resumption of international flights yet.

Monaco have failed with a bid to appoint former Tottenham Hotspur coach, Mauricio Pochettino, as their new manager, The Athletic reports. Monaco sacked their manager, Robert Moreno over the weekend, the fourth boss they have dismissed in the last two years, with former Bayern Munich manager Niko Kovac succeeding him. Kovac was not the first choice of the French Ligue 1 club. However, Monaco newly-appointed sporting director, Paul Mitchell reportedly contacted Pochettino about the vacant managerial role following the sacking of Moreno, only to be rebuffed. The opportunity presented to Pochettino was described as “lucrative”, but it was not enough for the former Southampton manager to make the move. Pochettino remains desperate to secure an imminent return to the Premier League. The Argentine is waiting for the right opportunity to return to club management, after being sacked by Tottenham last November.

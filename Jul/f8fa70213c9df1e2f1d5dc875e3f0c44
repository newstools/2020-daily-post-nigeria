Nigeria’s Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has said the federal government is not in a hurry to announce the resumption of international flights. Sirika stated this while speaking during the daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 yesterday. The Minister made it clear that any decision taken would be in the interest of Nigerians. He pointed out that several countries have not opened up for international flight operations and that Nigeria has not received clearance to fly to countries who are already receiving foreign visitors. “Everyone is trying to keep safe. These and many other reasons will make us be cautious and study some more and liaise with stakeholders to decide when we will open international flights. “Within the sector, we want to reopen because we are bleeding and losing money but we have to remain alive first before we make money. Whatever decision we take has to be in the interest of humanity in general,” Sirika said. He also added that the World Health Organisation, the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS) and other aviation stakeholders would be consulted, before any announcement is made.

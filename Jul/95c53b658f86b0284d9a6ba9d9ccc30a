Manchester United have put their Europa League campaign at risk, by allowing their stars to go on holiday outside the UK this week, SportsMail reports. Odion Ighalo, Nemanja Matic and Victor Lindelof are some of the players who flew out after the Premier League season ended last weekend. The UK have re-imposed 14-day quarantine restrictions on all travellers from Spain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned that the travel corridor could be closed on other European countries at short notice, amid fears over a second wave of COVID-19. United are 5-0 up from their first leg against LASK Linz and certain to progress in next week’s Europa League last-16 second leg at Old Trafford. However, the quarter-final is on August 10, which means that any players forced to self-isolate for 14 days would be unavailable for that game as well. United’s squad are expected to report back at the end of the week, although it is unclear how many more of them have travelled abroad. The club insists that no players have travelled to countries on the UK’s red list, but they will continue to monitor the situation and contact the players if it changes.

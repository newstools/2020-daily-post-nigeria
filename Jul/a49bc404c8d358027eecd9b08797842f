The Osun State House of Assembly has passed into law the revised 2020 budget of 82.2 billion naira. The State Assembly had received a letter from Governor Gboyega Oyetola requesting for an amendment of the state 2020 Appropriation Bill from N119. 55 billion to N82.22 billion due to the effect of COVID-19 on the global economy. The revised budget which now awaits the governorâ€™s assent was passed without any adjustments by the House of Assembly. Oyetola in the letter sent to the state Assembly disclosed that the reason for reducing the appropriation bill was as a result of the effect of COVID-19 on the revenue generation variables of the state. The development equally affected Federal Government allocation and state revenue. He said N9.4 billion of the revised amendment would be spent and dedicated to fighting COVID-19 and the post-COVID-19 pandemic effects in the state. Oyetola said the amendment was based on reality and implored the lawmakers not to give attention to any state ministry, agency or department that wanted any upward adjustment of its budget.

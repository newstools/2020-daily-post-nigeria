Big Brother Naija housemate, Kaisha has described every other housemate in the house as fake. Kaisha said this to Biggie during her diary session as she broke down in tears. She said: “Everyone is fake here, they are all just acting up “They would be nice today and the next thing they are not nice. It is just three days and all these things are happening. “Fake friendship, laughter, conversation for me. “At first I thought Erica was cool with me but then she changed towards me. Right now I’m not bonding with anyone “It is making the house tense and that’s not what I expected. I expected the house to be fun but clearly, it’s not.” She, however, hoped that things would get better as the show continues. Responding, BIggie advised Kaisha to learn to adapt and strife despite all odds. “Sometimes life throws things at us unexpectedly, it is left to you to adapt and strive. Big brother believes you have what it takes to survive in the house and that is why he chose you,” Biggie told Kaisha. See who wan win 80million. Kaisha is so insecure and defensively rude. Can’t wait for her to leave. #BBnaija #BbNajia pic.twitter.com/X4vprY25cT — #BBNaija ❼ (@bbnaijavibes) July 22, 2020

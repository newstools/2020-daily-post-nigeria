Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has said his recent statements and sermons were meant for his children and not his critics. Adeboye said this during Sunday service while responding to backlash from feminists and some Nigerians of his birthday message to his wife, Folu. DAILY POST recalls that Adeboye was criticised days ago after he commended his wife for being submissive and advised women to learn from her and not to fail in their primary duties. Nigerians, especially feminists took offence at his comments and accused him of exerting masculinity and being oppressive. However, Adeboye, preaching on Sunday in a sermon titled “From lockdown to lifting up”, said his message is for only his children, adding that they are the only ones who would understand his perspectives. He argued that some of the things he says annoy non-members of the church. “As a matter of fact, if there is a way of preaching this sermon just to my own children alone, that is what I would have done but that would be selfish. “Occasionally, there are things you say to your children that would annoy outsiders but I am not talking to you, I am talking to my children. He added that the lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic has made the door open to everybody to listen to his messages. “Some people see the glory but don’t know the story. Some people see me and say all kinds of things. It is none of my business.” The cleric added that he does not need to respond to anyone but keep doing his work for Christ.

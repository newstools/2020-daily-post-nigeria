Leeds United have returned to the Premier League after Huddersfield Town defeated West Brom 2-1 in the Championship on Friday. Chris Willock opened the scoring for the host before Dara O’Shea levelled proceedings on the stroke of half time for the visitors. Emile Smith Rowe then netted a late goal to give Huddersfield all three points against West Brom. West Brom’s defeat also means that Leeds can no longer drop out of the top two with two games left for them to play in the Championship. However, Brentford can move above West Brom into the automatic promotion positions if they win tomorrow night. Meanwhile, Leeds have kept 21 clean sheets in the Championship this season. They are currently on top of the Championship table with 87 points after 44 games. Their next game is against Derby on Sunday.

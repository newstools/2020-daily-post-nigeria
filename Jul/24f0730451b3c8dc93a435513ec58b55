Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has labeled midfielder, Mason Mount, as one of his most important players at Stamford Bridge. According to Lampard, he relies on Mount a lot because the England international brings so much to his team in terms of work ethic. The Blues boss said this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash against West Ham United on Wednesday night. Lampard, who coached Mount during their time together at Derby County was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying: “I rely on Mason a lot. “I did at Derby, and I do at Chelsea. “He brings so much to the team with his work ethic, the way he can start the press from midfield and then obviously his quality on the ball, which is only going to get better and is already at a really high level. “He works brilliantly every day, and he knows how much I trust in him. “I had to make a decision, but it does not affect my thinking for West Ham or going forward.”

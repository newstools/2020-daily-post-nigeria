Thanks to every fan for your support through these years, to the club for giving me the chance of being a Blue and to my teammates. You’ll be in my heart forever. Now let’s fight for the FA Cup trophy!!! BIG BLUE FAMILY.” In his five seasons at Chelsea, Pedro scored a total of 44 goals in 232 matches, including 3 scored in the just concluded season.

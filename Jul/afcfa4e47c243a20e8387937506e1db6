Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has asked the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, to investigate allegations that he received N4billion from the suspended acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu. This was contained in a petition addressed to Adamu through Osinbajo’s lawyer, Taiwo Osipitan and dated July 8, 2020. The vice-president stated that Jackson Ude, who published the allegations, will continue to publish these “false claims” on social media until action for “criminal defamation” is taken against him. Osipitan said if the allegation is proven untrue after investigation, Adamu should initiate criminal proceedings against Ude, who has painted Osinbajo as “a dishonest and disloyal public officer”. The petition read in part: “We are of the view that unless an action for criminal defamation is commenced against the said Mr. Jackson Ude, he will continue to use his social media platform to publish materials that are false and criminally defamatory of our client’s reputation. “In view of the above, we humbly request that you cause the above allegations, made against our client, to be investigated and if the suggested investigation confirms our complaint of the falsehood of these allegations, to initiate criminal proceedings pursuant to the provisions of sections 391 – 395 of the penal code act for criminal defamation against the said Jackson Ude,” part of Osipitan’s petition read. Ude accused Osinbajo of taking N4billion from Magu, who is accused of embezzling N39 billion recovered loot. But Osinbajo through his spokesman, Laolu Akande, denied the claims and described it as “baseless”. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-814849 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png" alt="" width="299" height="613" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image.png 299w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-146x300.png 146w" sizes="(max-width: 299px) 100vw, 299px"> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-814850 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png" alt="" width="271" height="592" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1.png 271w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/image-1-137x300.png 137w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px">

Ondo Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, says no form of violence will be allowed during the governorship election. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had fixed October 10 for the poll. The governor gave the warning on Tuesday in Akure during the swearing-in of the new Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Temitayo Oluwatuyi. The former SSG, Ifedayo Abegunde, resigned on Monday. He revealed that Akeredolu was rigged into power and that he lost the 2016 election to People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Eyitayo Jegede. Speaking at the ceremony, Akeredolu told “politicians and their hirelings” to be extremely cautious and maintain public peace. He said no one should encourage acts against “the safety and well-being of the people. We will sanction all infractions to our laws firmly and promptly.” Akeredolu urged the new SSG to remain dedicated and not to betray the trust reposed in him. In his remarks, Oluwatuyi thanked the governor for the opportunity. “By God’s grace, I assure you that I won’t disappoint. I promise to be loyal and forge ahead in Ondo State. I won’t be an ingrate,” he said. Oluwatuyi was formerly the Commissioner for Natural Resources.

Real Madrid defender, Raphael Varane, has insisted that Zinedine Zidane’s side does not control the Video Assistant Referee (VAR). Varane said this after Real Madrid defeated Alaves 2-0 in the La Liga on Friday night. Karim Benzema and Marco Asensio scored for Real Madrid, as Los Blancos went four points clear of Barcelona at the top of the La Liga table. DAILY POST recalls that Barcelona centre-back, Gerard Pique and club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, have suggested Real Madrid are benefiting from favourable decisions from VAR. But Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane had since said that he was ‘tired’ of hearing such comments. Speaking on the development, Varane said Real Madrid is only focused on winning this year’s La Liga title, adding that talks outside the pitch concerning VAR do not bother his team. “Outside noise doesn’t matter to us. We are focused on winning and giving everything on the pitch,” The France international told Movistar. “We do not control the VAR. We control the effort and attitude we show on the pitch.” “We are focused on our objective, and we have three finals left,” he added. “It was important to win, of course, but it is very important to keep a clean sheet. That gives us a lot of confidence. “We will continue with the positive dynamics we have.”

Manchester United beat Bournemouth 5-2 on Saturday, to move into fourth place, at least until Chelsea take on Watford later in the day. The Red Devils fought back from conceding a shock goal by Junior Stanislas, to overpower the relegation-threatened Cherries. Mason Greenwood equalized with a powerful shot, before Marcus Rashford scored from the penalty spot after referee Mike Dean spotted handball. Anthony Martial curled in a brilliant third to put United in firm control at half-time. Josh King pulled one back from the spot to make it 3-2, but Greenwood responded again for the hosts. Bruno Fernandes rounded off the scoring with a free-kick. Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s men now have 55 points from 33 fixtures.

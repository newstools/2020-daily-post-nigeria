Social media influencer, Adedamola Adewale popularly known as Adeherself has been granted bail of N500,000 by an Ikeja Special Offences Court. Adeherself had been in custody of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), following her arraignment in court on July 7, for being in possession of fraudulent documents. EFCC counsel, Mr Samuel Daji, told the court that the defendant was arrested following intelligence received by the EFCC on the activities of some young men allegedly involved in internet fraud in the Lekki axis of Lagos. “Adeherself on June 15, with the intent to defraud, had in her possession a fraudulent document which was entitled ‘WhatsApp’. “The offence violates Sections 318 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2011,” Daji added. While ruling, Justice Sherifat Solebo on Wednesday granted the defendant N500,000 bail and ordered that she provides two sureties with reliable means of income which would be verified by the court. Solebo, therefore, adjourned the case until Aug. 5 for substantive hearing.

Manchester United, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is set to break a 27-year-old record at Old Trafford when his side tackle Southampton in the Premier League on Monday night. Solskjaer’s side is in the middle of a 17-game unbeaten run in all competitions, and United will go third on the Premier League table ahead of Chelsea and Leicester City if they beat Southampton tonight. Man United have not lost a match since the restart of the Premier League. Their last three games have all ended with margins of three goals, with the likes of Mason Greenwood, Bruno Fernandes and Anthony Martial in great form. However, according to the Daily Star, Solskjaer stands on the brink of setting a new Premier League record if he features the same starting XI that defeated Aston Villa 3-0 in their previous game. It will be the fifth time in a row if the Norwegian lines up with the same XI that he went with at Villa Park which has not happened since 1993. Meanwhile, Solskjaer, who will be without two key players against Southampton, has also hinted during his pre-match press conference that he could play the same starting XI against the Saints that defeated Aston Villa. Solskjaer said: “There’s so many things you have to consider when you manage a team. “We have got players here chomping at the bit, but also those that are in the rhythm.” Man United previous XI against Aston Villa: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Matic, Pogba, Rashford, Fernandes, Greenwood, Martial.

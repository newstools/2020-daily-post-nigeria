He explained that soon a team of experts from the Agency would be dispatched to investigate the extent of damage caused by flood to fish farmers. According to him, “sending our team there will enable the state government to come up with modernities on how to assist victims to reduce their hardship.” “Though the state government is now battling with insufficient funds due to the Coronavirus pandemic, it cannot fold its arm and allow it’s people to suffer without coming to their aid, especially during this trying moment.” Malam Mohammad Tukur, fish farmer, who appeared devastated told reporters that the incident was the first of its kind in the area.

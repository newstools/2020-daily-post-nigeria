Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, has revealed efforts of the federal government towards the resumption of international flights in Nigeria. Mustapha, who is the Chairman of the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19, said talks are currently ongoing between the taskforce and the Ministry of Aviation aimed at resuming international flight. He made the disclosure during the taskforce daily briefing in Abuja. “Most importantly, the arrival protocols for passengers on inbound flights are being firmed up for seamless testing and detection. Relevant MDAs will be holding further consultations,” Mustapha said. Following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nigeria, the federal government had shut down all airports in the country. While the Nigerian government gave a green light for the commencement of local flights, international flight was still restricted.

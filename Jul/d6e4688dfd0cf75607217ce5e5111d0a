President Donald Trump has spoken on Kanye West’s announcement of his presidential bid. The American leader told RealClearPolitics on Tuesday that he is not sure of West’s seriousness. Trump stated that the rapper joined late because he will not appear on many state ballots. He said Kanye West’s campaign would be limited to certain states, “because in some states the deadline has been missed”. The Republican candidate for the November election opined that the music and fashion mogul could use this period for trial. “He would have to view this as a trial run for what’s going to happen in four years”, Trump added.

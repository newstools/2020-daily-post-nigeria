Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has reacted to his side’s FA Cup semi-final 3-1 victory over Manchester United on Sunday at Wembley Stadium. He also revealed what he told attacking midfielder, Mason Mount, before the England youngster scored a powerful shot goal against the Red Devils. Three goals from Olivier Giroud, Mason Mount and Harry Maguire (OG) ensured Frank Lampard’s side defeated Man United. Bruno Fernandes did score a late consolation goal for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side at Wembley Stadium. “It’s a great achievement for us to get to the FA Cup final, to win a semi is great but to win the final is the main thing,” Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying after the game. “It’s right up there with one of our best performances, but we have had some good performances this season.” Speaking on Mount’s goal, Lampard added: “I asked Mason to strike through the ball more, and you have to strike through it against top goalkeepers.” Chelsea will now face Arsenal, who defeated Manchester City, in the final on August 1.

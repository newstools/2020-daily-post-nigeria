Manchester City and Bournemouth have agreed a €43 deal for Nathan Ake. This was revealed by respected Italian sports journalist, Fabrizio Romano, via his Twitter feed on Thursday morning. Romano tweeted: “Man City have found an agreement to sign Nathan Aké from Bournemouth. “€43M will be the fee – paperworks time to complete the deal. “Pep wants him after problems for Koulibaly (Man City are still angry with Napoli because of Jorginho/Chelsea deal two years ago).” Manchester United were believed to be keen on signing Ake, who suffered relegation with the Cherries this season. But their city rivals have moved quickly to wrap up a deal, after the summer transfer window opened this Monday.

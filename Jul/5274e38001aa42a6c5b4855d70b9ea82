The Chief Judge of Ondo State, Justice Olarenwaju Akeredolu has declined the request by the Ondo State House of Assembly to set up a probe panel against the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi. According to the Chief Judge in a reply to the request of the Speaker, Bamidele Oleyelogun, the Assembly did not meet the constitutional requirements needed to impeach the embattled deputy governor. A total of 14 members of the assembly had signed an impeachment notice against the deputy governor, listing seven allegations against him. Nine other members of the Assembly had also written to the Speaker and the Chief Judge to distance themselves from the impeachment. The Chief Judge relied on this to conclude that the Assembly failed to form the two-third majority required to impeach the deputy governor. Justice Akeredolu also said she had received a letter from Ajayiâ€™s lawyers stating that the process of impeachment was sub judice.

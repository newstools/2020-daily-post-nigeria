Jude Ojeogwu, Father of Nollywood actress, Regina Daniels, has said that he decided to reconcile with her daughter’s billionaire husband, Ned Nwoko, following the birth of his grandson. Regina Daniels recently gave birth to a baby boy, her first child for politician husband, Nwoko. Barrister Ojegwu had staunchly opposed the marriage of the then 20-year old actress to the business mogul. At the baby’s naming ceremony, held in Abuja yesterday evening, Ojeogwu told journalists that the birth of the baby made him reconcile with his billionaire son-in-law for the sake of peace, joy, and happiness. Nwoko and Regina named their son Munir at the ceremony where Ojeogwu insisted that the birth of the new baby made him change his mind about Nwoko. “The birth of this child has answered the question (about the controversy); everybody craves for peace, joy, and happiness. I have accepted everything,” he said. “I feel very happy having a grandchild and that is why I am here. I traveled all the way from Lagos to this place just to celebrate with the family. “I told him (Nwoko) and the mother to call him Ifechukwude which means what God has written.”

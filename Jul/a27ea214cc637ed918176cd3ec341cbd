Terver Akase, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has confirmed that he tested negative for COVID-19. Akase told DAILY POST that he tested negative alongside his principal, Ortom. He explained that the test was carried out on some government appointees on June 29, 2020 and the result came back few days ago. Akase, therefore, advised Benue residents to adhere to COVID-19 protocol, adding that the disease is not a death sentence. “ I and Governor Ortom tested negative. Most government appointees were tested on June 29 but many of us came back negative. “ I am grateful to God my result came back negative. I join my boss in calling on Benue people to adhere to the protocol on COVID-19. It is not a death sentence. “The governor keeps encouraging people to go for the test. It is only by the test, they will ascertain their status and if they are positive they can start treatment. “It is unfortunate that some people believe there is no COVID-19 in Benue state. They are deceiving themselves, deaths have been recorded in Benue. “As at today, we have recorded five deaths in Benue. COVID-19 is real. Everyone must maintain the protocols such as washing of hands with soap, social distancing and wearing of facemask,” he added.

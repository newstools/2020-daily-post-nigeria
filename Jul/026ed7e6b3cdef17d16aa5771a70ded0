A High Court in Akure, the Ondo State capital, has struck out a motion seeking to stop the state’s Deputy Governor, Hon. Agboola Ajayi, from participating in the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) primaries on Wednesday. The presiding Judge, Justice Bode Adegbehingbe, instructed the plaintiff to serve all parties in the suit instead of coming through a motion exparte. A PDP member, Olopele Konstante Timi had through his counsel, Akpofiweii Anthony, asked the court to disqualify Ajayi over alleged certificate forgery. Olopele, in the suit, stated that Hon. Ajayi breached the code of conduct for public officers and should be banned from holding any public office for up to 10 years. The exparte motion brought before the court was instituted with originating summon dated July 17, 2020, with suit no. AK/45M/2020. Justice Adegbehingbe, however, threw out the motion exparte and fixed the hearing of the substantive suit for July 30, 2020.

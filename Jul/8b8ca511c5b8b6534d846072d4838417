Arsenal defender, David Luiz, has said he will only cut his hair if he becomes a manager. At 33 years, Luiz is already looking forward to life after playing. The Brazil international has committed to another year with the Gunners, despite a shaky stint since his arrival from Chelsea. Luiz has also expressed a desire to go for a second spell at Portuguese giants Benfica before heading into retirement. When asked by Esquire what he would do if he went into management, he said: “I’d put a suit on and cut my hair. “I can’t be a coach with this hair, nobody’s going to respect me!”

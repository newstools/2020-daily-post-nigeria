This year’s Community Shield will take place at Wembley Stadium on Saturday, August 29, the FA has confirmed. The traditional curtain-raiser for the new season will see Premier League champions Liverpool play either Arsenal or Chelsea, who meet in this Saturday’s FA Cup final. Manchester City won last year’s Community Shield after beating Liverpool at Wembley. The kick-off time for the game will be announced at a later date. After the Community Shield match, there will be an international break from September 2 to 10. This is coming after the Premier League revealed last week that the 2020/2021 season would start on September 12 and run until May 23, 2021.

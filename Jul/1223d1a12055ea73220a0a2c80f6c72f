Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, is keen to bolster his defence this summer’s transfer window and has reportedly decided which player will leave the club to make room for his top transfer targets. This is coming after Chelsea loss 3-2 to West Ham United in the Premier League on Wednesday. Last night’s defeat only further highlighted Chelsea’s fragility at the defence position. Chelsea have already signed Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner, with both players set to provide the Blues with extra firepower next season. Still, the leaky defence also needs sorting out this summer. However, The Athletic is now reporting that centre-back, Kurt Zouma could be one of the first defenders to leave Stamford Bridge despite not featuring against West Ham. The reports added that Lampard is keen to add West Ham star, Declan Rice, to his squad and will play him at centre-half. Alonso, Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen all featured ahead of Zouma. Recall that Zouma was among the four players the club put up for sale some weeks ago. The France international has since fallen down the pecking order in Lampard’s choice of defenders. The 25-year-old has made only two Premier League stars in 2020. Speaking on Chelsea’s defeat against West Ham, Lampard said: “We dominated the game in terms of possession, but made mistakes, and we were hurt for that. “I am not happy with any of the goals. You do not get given victories for scoring two goals, and you have to be better than that.” —

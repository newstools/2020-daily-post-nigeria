The Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, has made clarifications on reports making the rounds that the closure of international airspace has been extended till October 15, 2020. International flights were suspended in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sirika on Tuesday clarified that the circular by Nigerian Airspace Management Agency, NAMA, is a 90-days routine to airmen not an extension of the ban. The Minister on his official Twitter page hinted that the resumption of flight operation will be announced soon and likely earlier than October. Sirika wrote: “International flight resumption date is not October. NAMA just issued a routine 90-day Notices to Airmen (NOTAM). “In liaison with Health, Foreign Affairs & PTF COVID-19, we’ll announce the agreed date, regardless of the ban by Europe, UAE etc. May be earlier than October.”

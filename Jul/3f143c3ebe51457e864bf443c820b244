Just a few hours after the launch of Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020, some Nigerian musicians have already chosen their favourite housemate. Twenty housemates were on Sunday introduced into the BBNaija house by Ebuka Obi-Uchendu The housemates: Ozor, Vee, Prince, Lilo, Lucy, Trickytee, Kidd Waya, Dorothy, Praise, Wathoni, Tochi, Katrina, Eric, Erica, Brighto, Kaisha, Neo, TolaniBaj, Laycon and Nengi would entertain viewers for a period of ten weeks. It is not certain if artistes will be allowed into the house like previous editions due to the coronavirus pandemic but organisers announced that there would not be unexpected visits from celebrities. However, some seemed to have chosen the housemate they will vote for this year. Popular rapper, Reminisce took to his Twitter page declaring himself as a ‘Laycon’ fan. Here are some comments: @Oxladeofficial “This is a Laycon Stan account” @ChinkoEkun “Laycon has a high prospect. Forget the slanders and jokes made around him!” @Iamreminisce “Laycon!! Go Kid!” @Iamdotun “This Laycon looks like he came to sell “SK” inside the Big Brother house. I like him sha” @SeanTizzle “Laycon.” @NobleIgwe “I’d like to see Laycon blow off the show” Olamilekan “Laycon” Agbeleshe is a 26-year-old budding singer and rapper from Lagos.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom State has rejected the creation of 39 new political wards by the State Independent Electoral Commission, saying that it has no powers to do so. A statement by the party’s State Publicity Secretary, Mr. Nkereuwem Enyongekere, in Uyo Thursday, described the exercise as dubious, illegal and unilateral and urged Akwa Ibom people to disregard it. Enyongekere said that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria empowered only the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to create wards. The APC spokesman cited the Supreme Court’s nullification of similar wards creation in Cross River to buttress the party’s position. “In line with the resolution of the State Working Committee issued at its meeting of July 28, 2020. “The All Progressives Congress, Akwa Ibom State chapter, rejects in totality the dubious, unilateral and illegal creation of 39 electoral wards in the state by Akwa Ibom State Independent Electoral Commission as announced by its Chairman, Mr Ikoiwak on Sunday, July 26, 2020. “The party, therefore, calls on Akwa Ibom people to disregard this illegality, as the state has no such powers to create electoral wards. “The Constitution of the Federal Government of Nigeria vests the power of creating wards only in the Independent National Electoral Commission. “The nullification of similar wards creation by the Supreme Court when it happened in Cross River State attests to our current position,” he said.

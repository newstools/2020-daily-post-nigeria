Operatives of Traffic and Indiscipline Management Agency of Abia State, TIMAAS, have apprehended one Mr John Ude from Isikwuato Local Government Area of Abia State for allegedly extorting various sums of money from roadside traders within Brass Junction area of Aba. The suspect collects three thousand naira, N3000, and above daily from the roadside traders that are blocking the roadways in the Aba city with their wares. It would be recalled that the Commandant of TIMAAS, Bright Chinedu Ikeokwu, had warned a couple of days to deal decisively with those who are responsible for extorting money from the traders and encouraging them to stay put. While being interrogated by the Abia Traffic Agency, Ude admitted to extorting money from the traders but said he collected only about N500 from them. Speaking on their ordeals in the hands of the suspect, during a chat with newsmen, on Wednesday, some of the roadside traders that pleaded anonymity, claimed that they had been paying between N3000 and N3,500, to avoid altercation with the suspect, whom they saw as revenue collection agent of the Abia State government. Meanwhile, the Abia Agency said the suspect would be charged to court as no stone would be left unturned in ridding the State of all forms of illegal trading.

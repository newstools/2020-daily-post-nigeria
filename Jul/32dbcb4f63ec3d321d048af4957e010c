The Blues, in a post via its official website, said Tomori and Kovacic have muscle and Achilles injuries respectively. At the same time, Kante sustained a tight hamstring injury against Watford over the weekend. “There are doubts over the fitness of Fikayo Tomori and Mateo Kovacic, both of whom missed our weekend win over Watford with muscle and Achilles injuries respectively, as well as Kante, who came off late in that game feeling a tight hamstring,” Chelsea said. Chelsea defeated Watford 3-0 on Saturday in their previous Premier League fixture. Frank Lampard’s side is currently in the fourth position on the Premier League table with 57 points from 33 games.

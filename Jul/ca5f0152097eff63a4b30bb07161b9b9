Nigeria’s Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), may have failed to enforce COVID-19 guidelines at the wedding ceremony of his son. A viral video appeared on social media on Friday night of the wedding ceremony of Malami’s son, Abdul Aziz who was caught on camera dancing with his new bride. DAILY POST observes that the number of guests at the ceremony surpassed twenty as against the guidelines by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control, NCDC for a wedding ceremony. NCDC guidelines forbids social events like weddings where there are more than 20 persons in attendance in order to contain the spread of coronavirus. The video shared by Omoyele Sowore, the presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in the 2019 election on his Twitter page showed violation of NCDC directive on social distancing and wearing of face masks despite increasing cases of coronavirus in Nigeria. The guests were seen spraying Naira notes at the couple and not observing social distancing. Use of face mask was totally ignored by the entire guests.

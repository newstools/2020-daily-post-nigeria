Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has hailed midfielder, Curtis Jones after the 19-year-old’s performance in the Reds’ Premier League 2-0 win against Aston Villa on Sunday evening. Liverpool made it seventeen wins out of seventeen at Anfield, thanks to two goals from Sadio Mane and Curtis Jones to give the Reds all three points against Aston Villa. The UEFA Champions League holders are now unbeaten in their last fifty-seven Premier League home matches with forty-seven victories and ten draws, and they have won 24 home games in a row. ” That is Curtis in a nutshell. He signed a new contract yesterday (Saturday) which is good for him and good for us. We will have a lot of fun with him,” Klopp told a post-match press conference after the game. ” It was a very difficult game for different reasons. Aston Villa are obviously organised and made it tricky for us,” He added. “The wind made it tricky for both, but it was really hard to play normal football.”

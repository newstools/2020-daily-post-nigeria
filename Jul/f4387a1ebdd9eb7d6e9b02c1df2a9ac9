Barcelona manager, Quique Setien, has said he could be sacked before they resume their Champions League campaign in August. Quique, speaking after a 2-1 home defeat to Osasuna on Thursday, admitted his job is at risk after they failed a failed LaLiga title defence. Real Madrid wrestled back the title from their rivals with a 2-1 win over Villarreal. Los Blancos are now seven points ahead of Barca with each club having one fixture left. Barca now only have the Champions League left to play for, with their round of 16-second leg tie against Napoli set to take place in Lisbon next month. But Setien told reporters post-match: “I hope to be the Barcelona coach in the Champions League but I don’t know.”

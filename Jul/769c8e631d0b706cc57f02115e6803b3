Chairman, ECOWAS Heads of Government, President Mahamadou Issoufou, says the body will do all it can to resolve the political crisis in Mali. He gave the assurance at a briefing after hours of consultations in the nation’s capital, Bamako, on Thursday. The meeting was attended by President Muhammadu Buhari, Host President, Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and Presidents Machy Sall of Senegal, Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana and Alassane Ouattara of Cote d’Ivoire. They were briefed by ECOWAS Special Envoy, former President Goodluck Jonathan, opposition leader, Imam Mahmoud Dicko, representatives of opposition alliance, M5-RFP and civil society organisations. Keita also gave a brief on the socio-political situation, especially the disagreements that spiralled into protests and violence. Issoufou, President of Niger Republic, announced that a virtual meeting of Presidents will be held on Monday July 26, 2020, to further deliberate on the issues raised. Issoufou said the regional leaders agreed there would be a need for a compromise to protect the peace and integrity of Mali. He noted that allowing the political crisis to linger would affect other West African countries. The ECOWAS Chairman commended Jonathan for accepting to lead the mission to the country to broker peace. In his remarks, Akufo-Addo hinted that the ECOWAS protocol would be followed. He said the tenet adopted by the body spells out that a President can only be voted into power, and voted out by election, except he completes his tenure. At the end of the meeting, President Buhari returned to Nigeria.

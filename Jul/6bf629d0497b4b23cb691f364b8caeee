The Southern Nigeria Peoples Mandate (SNPM) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to set up a panel to probe financial misappropriation in the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). SNPM president, Augustine Chukwudum, made the call in a statement on Tuesday. He said the revelation by the Niger Delta Minister, Godswill Akpabio, that the same lawmakers investigating the agency got contracts, had dented the ongoing investigation. Chukwudum noted that a presidential panel would carry out an in-depth investigation of the NDDC management, Akpabio, members of the House of Representatives, and others accused. “We are making this clarion call on President Buhari because Nigerians have lost confidence with the House Committee on NDDC that is probing the alleged looting. They cannot be the judge in a case they are directly involved and have serious questions to answer,” he said. SNPM lamented the level of infrastructure decay and non-availability of social amenities in the Niger Delta region despite trillions of Naira pumped into the commission. The body regretted that some sons and daughters of the region appointed to better the living condition of their people were allegedly depriving the people of their right. Chukwudum told Buhari to prove to the world that his anti-corruption war was not selective. “This is why he must sack the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Sen. Godswill Akpabio and the NDDC management”, he added.

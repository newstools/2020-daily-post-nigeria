The Minister of Humanitarian and Social Development , Hajiya Sadiya Umar Farouq has said that the government of President Muhammadu Buhari does not discriminate in its social investment scheme, stating that poverty does not discriminate against social, religious or tribal lines any where in the world. The minister made the observation during a press conference in Gusau, the state capital while responding to questions on speculations that distribution of financial assistance by her ministry was meant for only APC members across the country. Sadiya explained that all government empowerment schemes coming from her ministry cover every individual citizen irrespective of his or her political or religious inclination, pointing out that there are states in the country that are hundred percent controlled by the PDP which is the main opposition party, “but they receive equal treatment as their APC counterparts,” she said. She said that the APC leadership led by President Buhari was acting the role of a father whose concern and care cut across all religious and political borders, giving assurance that the Federal government is ever committed to offer every citizen fair treatment. On the level of achievement so far recorded in Zamfara State for the registration of target beneficiaries of the current distribution of Federal assistance, Hajiya said registration has reached seventy percent in the state. Sadiya disclosed that the success was achieved through the cooperation and support offered by governor Bello Matawalle, expressing appreciation for his contribution to the success. According to her, the delay in the distribution exercise was caused by the cancelation of contracts for the programme due to incompetence on the part of the contractors, but explained that things are now in order and the distribution has already begun on Friday. “However each of the beneficiaries would benefit with the sum of thirty thousand (N30,000) Naira and I warn that anything below that amount should be rejected and must immediately be reported for appropriate action.”

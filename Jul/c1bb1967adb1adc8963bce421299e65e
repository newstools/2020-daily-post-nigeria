Real Madrid captain, Sergio Ramos, has reacted to his side’s 1-0 victory against Athletic Club in the La Liga on Sunday. The Spain defender described Los Blancos’ victory against Athletic as a hugely important three points, adding that the LaLiga title is now in their hand to win it ahead of Barcelona this term. Ramos netted the only goal of the match from the spot-kick in the second half to give Zinedine Zidane’s side all three points against the host. “That is a hugely important three points. We knew this was one of the most important games we had left in the LaLiga run-in. You always come up against opposition who are going to make it very hard for you in Bilbao,” Ramos was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying. “We had eleven cup finals remaining after the lockdown, and we had to take it step by step to try and take 3 points from each game”. “Once again, we showed we are in great shape physically against this kind of opposition. The team was ready. “Fortunately it is in our own hands, and we want to win this Liga title. “From the first minute, you could see the desire to take the game by the scruff of the neck, but you cannot win them all 3-0. This was another final.” Ramos will again hope to lead Real Madrid to victory when they host Alaves on Friday in their next fixture.

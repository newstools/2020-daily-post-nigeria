Norwich City has been relegated from the Premier League for a record fifth time. The Canaries needed to avoid defeat to West Ham on Saturday, to keep their fight going for at least another week. However, Michail Antonio scored four times, to send them back to the Championship one year after they won a promotion. Norwich now holds the unwanted record for the most relegations from the Premier League. They have previously suffered the drop in the 1994/1995, 2004/2005, 2013/2014 and 2015/2016 seasons. Middlesbrough, Sunderland and Crystal Palace have all been relegated four times since the Premier League was founded in 1991/1992. Norwich has endured a shocking restart since the COVID-19 lockdown, failing to win any of their six fixtures. Villa and Bournemouth are favourites to join the Canaries in the Championship next season.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that defender, Luke Shaw, will miss his side’s FA Cup semi-final clash against Chelsea on Sunday evening at Wembley Stadium due to injury. According to Solskjaer, Shaw has not fully recovered from his injury. He also provided the latest update on wing-back, Brandon Williams’ injury. Man United head to the game following a 2-0 victory against Crystal Palace in their Premier League last match. “Luke will be out [against Cheslsea], I can’t see him recovering,” Solskjaer was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying. “Brandon will hopefully be okay, he’ll try to join in training today, [despite] his eye problem. “We’ll see if he can see the ball when he comes in! He should be fine.” The match kick-off time is 6 pm.

Leicester City coach, Brendan Rodgers, has urged his players including Wilfried Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho and Jamie Vardy to “create some more history” after their 2-0 win over Sheffield United in the Premier League on Thursday night. Rodgers’ men defeated Sheffield United at the King Power Stadium, thanks to two goals from Ayoze Perez and Demarai Gray. The win over Sheffield means Leicester are in the fourth on the Premier League table with two games to conclude the season. “I thought we were brilliant,” Rodgers told Sky Sports after the game. “Sheffield United deserve so much credit for how they have worked and how Chris Wilder has got them playing, but we were outstanding. “We have played well since we have come back but not been consistent enough. Tonight, we were able to do that. A very good performance. “The result gives us the second-highest finish in Leicester’s history. We have two games to go to create some more history.”

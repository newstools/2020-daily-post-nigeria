There is an increase in the demand for oxygen by COVID-19 patients, according to the Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi. Abayomi stated this during a Zoom webinar by the Lagos Civil Society against COVID-19 on Friday. “We noticed that there is a slight increase in the demand for oxygen. “So, we are trying to make oxygen available across the local government areas so patients can get oxygen treatment to be stabilised. “Once they are stable, they can now be moved into isolation centres and get more medical treatment and hopefully, we can rescue them from getting into a more critical stage where we may now need to consider ventilating,” Abayomi said. The Commissioner further explained there are “about five levels of oxygen therapy before we get to the ventilation stage”. Lagos currently has the highest number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria with 10,910 patients.

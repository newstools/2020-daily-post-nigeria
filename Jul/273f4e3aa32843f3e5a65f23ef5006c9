The director-general stressed that no clinical study has been done yet on any of the products to prove their claim of efficacy. According to her, manufacturers of these products who have applied to the agency claimed that their products are only immune boosters and useful for the relief of symptoms associated with Coronavirus. “Once the product is able to meet all requirements, a listing status is granted with a clear disclaimer that states clearly that the claims have not been evaluated by NAFDAC. “The applicant can arrange for clinical trials at this stage that will involve the use of human subjects in order to prove the efficacy of claim for treatment following laid down procedures and with the approval of NAFDAC,” Adeyeye added.

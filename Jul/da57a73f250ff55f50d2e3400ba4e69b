The former Secretary to Ondo State Government, SSG, Ifedayo Abegunde has disclosed that his erstwhile principal, Rotimi Akeredolu, lost the 2016 governorship election to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, candidate, Eyitayo Jegede. Abegunde had on Monday morning resigned his appointment from as the SSG. According to him, it was through his power and that of some other APC pillars that made INEC to declare Akeredolu as governor after he had lost. “Akeredolu didn’t win the election in 2016 but we made it possible for him to become governor. We were the pillars behind him and we will not support him again. He will lose this time around.” Abegunde further alleged that only the immediate family of the governor, as well as his in-laws from Imo State, are enjoying governance in the state. “Akeredolu has reduced the government to the property of his wife, son and in-laws from Imo state. All the contracts in the state are being given to his wife, son and the people from Imo state.” The former SSG, who spoke in Akure, the Ondo State capital shortly after his resignation, described as enormous the sufferings he underwent in the hands of Governor Akeredolu for the three and half years, he held sway as the Secretary to his government. Abegunde said, “I was suffering in his (Akeredolu) administration because he didn’t release any funds for my office. He has been telling lies that he was giving me N5 million every month even when he knew he didn’t give me such money.” Abegunde who represented Akure North/South Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives between 2011 to 2015 disclosed that the ill-treatment melted on him by Akeredolu made him to quit. While speaking on his next political journey, the former SSG, however, disclosed that he has decided to support another aspirant from the APC, Mr. Segun Abraham, whom he described as the ‘Messiah’ that Ondo State needs.

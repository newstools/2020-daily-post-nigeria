Muhammad Sanusi, an erstwhile Emir of Kano, has pointed out some factors fuelling corruption in Nigeria. Sanusi said Nigeria would continue to witness corruption if incompetent people are allowed to occupy leadership positions. The former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, who spoke during a webinar tagged, ‘The sustainability of society’, also stated that corruption would continue in Nigeria if there is nepotism in the system. Sanusi stated that these factors would continue to hinder Nigeria’s development and affect its progress. He said, “Morally and religiously speaking, corruption is a problem. “Part of the problem we have is incompetence and that is why I keep saying we must pay attention to merit. There must be a merit test; a competence test. “For me, I think the root of corruption is when we begin to de-emphasize merit, competence and performance. “The worst form of corruption we have in this country is nepotism. ”

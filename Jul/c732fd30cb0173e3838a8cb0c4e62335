The Ballon d’Or event for this year has been cancelled. This is the first time ever the organizers would be taking this decision in the award’s history. They blamed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the football calendar. Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, won the 2019 award while OL Reign’s Megan Rapinoe took home the Ballon d’Or Feminin. Organisers of the award, Group L’Equipe, announced in a statement on Monday, saying: “There will be no edition in 2020, because it turns out, after thoughtful consideration, that all the conditions are not met. “We believe that such a singular year cannot – and should not – be treated as an ordinary one. “From a sports perspective, two months (January and February), out of the 11 generally required to form an opinion and decide who should lift the trophies, represent far too little to gauge and judge; without forgetting that the other games were played — or will be played — in unordinary conditions (behind closed doors, with five replacements, Champions League’s Final eight played in a single game).” Instead of awarding the usual four individual trophies, the organizers will announce a “Dream Team” at the end of the year. Eleven players will feature and will be chosen by the usual Ballon d’Or jury.

Nigeria’s vice-president, Yemi Osinbajo, has no intention of contesting to be president in 2023, according to his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande. Akande stated this while answering questions on an Instagram Live chat with the publisher of Ovation Magazine, Dele Momodu, on Monday. Momodu asked Akande if the attacks his principal has faced recently, was part of a plan to disrupt any ambition the vice president has in 2023. In response, Akande insisted that Osinbajo’s major focus was to support President Muhammadu Buhari until their tenure elapses. “I’m his spokesperson and all I know he wants to do is to do this job that he has been given very well and he doesn’t have any other plans right now about any such thing. I can tell you that clearly. “He has said to me several times, see Laolu, this is not a monarchy, we are going to be here for four or at best eight years, let’s just focus and do the work so that when we are gone, people will say we did this and that. So, he is entirely consumed with the job. “I’m his spokesperson and we have not talked about what he is going to do in 2023. What’s the point?” Akande said.

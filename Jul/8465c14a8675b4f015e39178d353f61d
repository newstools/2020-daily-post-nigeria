Martin Camano, the agent to Inter Milan right-back, Achraf Hakimi, has claimed that his client left Real Madrid to join the Serie A club because of the Los Blancos manager, Zinedine Zidane. DAILY POST recalls that Inter Milan had last Thursday completed the signing of Hakimi from Real Madrid. Hakimi spent the 2019/20 season on loan at Borussia Dortmund, but the Bundesliga side failed to match Inter Milan’s financial package before the 21-year-old Morocco international ultimately moved to the San Siro club for €40 million (£36m). “Zidane is the reason for Hakimi’s transfer to Inter Milan,” Camano told Al Mountakhab. “He must explain why Hakimi moved.” “Inter coach, Conte was always in contact with Hakimi,” He added. “He talked to him about the club’s future project, so we decided to move to Inter Milan.” “I believe that when a high-value coach like Conte calls you and strongly insists on contacting you. This is evidence that he wants you to become an important piece in his project. His team represents him.”

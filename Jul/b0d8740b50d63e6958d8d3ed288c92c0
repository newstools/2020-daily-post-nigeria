Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council, OYC, an Igbo socio-cultural group, has called out a former Military General, Theophilus Danjuma (Rtd) over the 1966 Coup that led to the death of ex-Military Head of State, Major General Thompson Aguiyi Ironsi. The Igbo group urged Danjuma to apologize to the Igbo nation and the family of Late Major General Aguiyi Ironsi, for forgiveness over his alleged role in toppling the first Military President. OYC President, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro and Secretary-General, Okwu Nnabuike, in a press release signed and forwarded to DAILY POST, on Friday, described late Aguiyi Ironsi, as a patriot and best among the finest military officers that made huge sacrifices for the existence of the country. Ohanaeze youths reiterated that Danjuma can rewrite history by tendering unreserved apologies to Ndigbo and openly support ndigbo for Nigeriaâ€™s presidency. The socio-cultural organization, however, insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government should rename 82 Division, Enugu, after late Major General Thompson Aguiyi Ironsi.

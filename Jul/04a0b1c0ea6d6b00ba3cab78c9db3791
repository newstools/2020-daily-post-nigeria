Man United made this known in a statement via its official website on Wednesday. “Manchester United pair Chris Smalling and Alexis Sanchez will both see out the remainder of the 2019/20 domestic campaign in Italy after the decision was made to extend their loan contracts with Roma and Inter Milan respectively,” a club statement read. “Smalling will stay at the Stadio Olimpico for the rest of the Serie A season, which is currently scheduled to last until the beginning of August, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Alexis’s deal at Inter Milan has also been extended until the end of the first week of next month.” Smalling, who marks ten years as a Man United player this summer, has played for the Roma on 30 occasions so far this campaign, scoring two goals.

The Court of Appeal sitting in Awka, Anambra State, has added two years to the five years prison term handed to convict, Ikenna Stanislaus Ugwunna. Justice Chudi Nwankwor of Anambra State High Court, Ogidi, gave the initial judgement. Not satisfied, the convict approached the appellate court for a reprieve. But the appellate court held that the trial court did not have the discretion to prescribe five years jail term for the offence as the law stipulates seven years in jail. Ugwunna’s ordeal started on March 31, 2014, when the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, arraigned him on six-count charges. The charges bordered on forgery and obtaining by false pretence, contrary to Sections 1(1) (a) of the Advance Fee Fraud and other Fraud Related Offences Act, 2006 and Section 443 (1) of the Criminal Code Law of Anambra State. EFCC revealed that in 2011, the convict told his victim that he was a representative of Guangzhou Zwei Import and Export Co. Ltd., a Chinese company that deals in vehicle spare parts. Ugwunna fraudulently obtained N12.4million to make supplies. He also forged sales confirmation receipts, purportedly from the company which has a branch office in Lagos. Ugwunna converted the money to his personal use and frustrated all victim’s recovery efforts. EFCC recalled that in the course of the investigation, he jumped administrative bail and absconded to Niger State where he hid there for more than a year. He was later arrested by the police and handed over to the Enugu Zonal Office of the EFCC. EFCC counsel, Adaka Ekwu, invited five witnesses and tendered several exhibits to prove the case before the adoption of final written addresses. Justice Nwankwor found him guilty of counts four, five and six of the charges and jailed him five years. Ugwunna will now be in prison for seven years as ordered by the Court of Appeal.

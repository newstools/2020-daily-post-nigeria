Jorge Masvidal has spoken after losing his welterweight title to Kamaru Usman on Sunday in UFC 251. Masvidal lost 50-45, 50-45, 49-46 on the three judges’ card in Abu Dhabi. It was his 14th career defeat and his fifth in his last 11 fights. After the fight, he took to Twitter to apologize to his fans, promising to bounce back. “Sorry, I couldn’t bring it home this time. Next time #theresurrection. “Let’s goooo @GamebredFighter representing the #305 in #UFC251,” Masvidal replied US senator, Marco Rubio, who had earlier tweeted in support of the 35-year-old. Usman also gave the Miami-born Mixed Martial Arts star credit for being a worthy contender.

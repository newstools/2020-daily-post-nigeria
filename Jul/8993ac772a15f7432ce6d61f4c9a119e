Roland Owie, a former Chief Whip of the Senate, has defected to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). He was the National Leader of the Action Democratic Party (ADP). The former lawmaker made announcement at his home town, Ilobi-Isi, near Ehor, Uhunmwonde LG in Edo, NAN reports. He urged his supporters to work for the reelection of Governor Godwin Obaseki. Owie, a PDP founding member, recalled that he and others including ex-President of the senate, late Chuba Okadigbo, were forced out of the party. He said recent developments in the polity ignited his conviction to realign with positive and progressive mainstream political forces. Owie revealed that over the past 15 months, he consulted political associates, former colleagues and elder statesmen on Nigeria’s state of affairs. Owie noted that a recurring issue that emanated from the meetings “was the need for all founding members of the PDP to return to the party so that it can achieve its strategic goal of emancipating Nigerians”. “Therefore, today I am returning to the PDP, the party I can call home, with a keen sense of purpose and a mission to work with the leadership and members in developing a sustainable developmental blueprint for Nigeria and jealously guarding the implementation of same.” Owie said because all politics is local, his return “would ensure that Govenor Godwin Obaseki is re-elected for a second term.” The influential politician said beyond physical developments accomplished by the Obaseki-led administration, his second term would engender equity, as the governorship would move to Edo Central Senatorial District in 2024. Owie declared that Nigeria is greatly divided, and almost back to primordial lines. He stressed that Nigeria is troubled and cannot be a nation where people are hated, branded and then hounded and ostracised. PDP leader in Edo South district, Owere Imasogie, led party stalwarts to the event.

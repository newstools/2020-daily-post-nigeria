The World Health Organization has said that there are 19 potential COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials. WHO Regional Office for Africa in Brazzaville, Congo, disclosed this in a series of tweets via its official Twitter handle @WHOAFRO, on Thursday night. The UN health agency said it was essential to test the COVID-19 vaccine in countries where it was needed to ensure that it would be useful. According to WHO, there are nearly 150 COVID-19 vaccines received, but only 19 were selected. It said: “As scientists across the world race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, @WHO urges all to take concrete actions to ensure equitable access. If & when a vaccine is developed, it must be available to everyone, not only those who can afford to pay. “Globally, there are 19 potential COVID-19 vaccines currently in clinical trials. “South Africa is the first African country to start a clinical trial, with @WitsUniversity testing a vaccine developed by Oxford Jenner Institute. Trials for the vaccine are ongoing in the UK & Brazil.”

Candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Edo Governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has assured the people of Edo State that his clarity of purpose and hunger for service will transform the decaying neglected infrastructure across the 18 Local Government Areas of the State. Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu who said this through his Director of Communication and Media, Mr. John Mayaki in Benin City also clarified the misattribution of his consistent ambition to desperation by few individuals, stating that contrary to their claims, he is driven by the desire to reposition and restructure Edo state with carefully thought-out policies and programs encapsulated in his SIMPLE agenda. According to him, ‘It’s sad and regrettable that my clarity of purpose is what shortsighted minds call desperation; it’s really a definite statement of ambition.” “It is true that the call for Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu as governor of Edo state is becoming clearer and louder he’s humbled by the people’s support and belief in him. The desire to reposition and restructure Edo state is now the project of all Edolits, which is the people’s project.” “The Simple Agenda—A Manifesto of Hope was there in 2016, coming into being as the comprehensive collection of politically applicable principles, clauses, and initiatives gained from long years in active political service. “A newer and updated version appears, coming to accommodate the needs of the time and to iron out a life ruffled by the bad attitudes of the Obaseki leadership.” “The updated manifesto reflects the pains and desires of the vast majority of Edo people whom Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu interacted with in consonance with his belief in people-centered governance and leadership. “Unfortunately, these are traits missing in Edo leadership as presently constituted where the scarce resources rather being used for the betterment of its citizens, are channeled to promote violence and thuggery, victimization and plunder.”

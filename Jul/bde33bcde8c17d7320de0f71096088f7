Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, on Monday, confirmed that N’Golo Kante, Mateo Kovacic and Fikayo Tomori would miss the Blues’ Premier League clash against Crystal Palace on Tuesday evening at Selhurst Park due to injury. DAILY POST recalls that Chelsea had earlier provided an injury update on Kante, Kovacic and Tomori. However, speaking at his pre-match press conference, Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying, “Kante won’t be in the squad. He has a low-level hamstring injury. “We are hoping it will be a week or so. I would expect we will be very lucky to have him for Sheffield United. “[Mateo] Kovacic trained with us today, he’s not ready for this game, hopefully, the next. “[Fikayo] Tomori is still not ready. He had a small setback in training so hopefully next week.” Chelsea defeated Watford 3-0 in their previous Premier League fixture on Saturday. Lampard’s men are currently in the fourth position on the Premier League log with 57 points from 33 games. The kick-off time for Crystal Palace vs Chelsea fixture is at 6 pm.

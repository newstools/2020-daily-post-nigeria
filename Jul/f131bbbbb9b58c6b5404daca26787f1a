The Department of State Services (DSS) has denied reports of assaulting an official of the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja. FAAN in a statement earlier accused Abba of slapping an Aviation Security Officer who was performing his duty and breaching security procedure. But in a statement by DSS Public Relations Officer of DSS, Dr Peter Afunanya, the DSS personnel were well mannered and could not have slapped or fought a worker of another agency. He urged Nigerians to disregard the report, adding that DSS recognises the Airports as one of the country’s most important assets and has remained at the forefront of protecting them and other critical ones. “It takes their security seriously and cannot breach it. As a strategic partner, the Service holds FAAN and its staff in good esteem. “Both agencies have, over time, enjoyed robust working relationships in the areas of training and exchange programmes,” the statement read. He added that there were other avenues than the social media for resolving any misunderstanding among staff of two agencies that have had a long history of unity of purpose in the execution of their mandates. He said the service had high value for effective interagency collaboration needed to achieve positive outcomes for good of the country.

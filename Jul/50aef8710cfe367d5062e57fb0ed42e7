Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has predicted that next season will be ‘different’ for his team following their Premier League final day 2-0 win against Leicester City on Sunday at the King Power Stadium. Man United finished third on the Premier League table this season after beating Leicester, thanks to Bruno Fernandes’ penalty and a goal from Jesse Lingard. But Solskjaer believes next season will be even more testing for the Red Devils, adding that his players must have to get used to playing 45 to 50 games for this club. “All the predictions were sixth or seventh. That’s alright. If I am getting criticised that makes me stronger and believe more in what I am doing. “Next season with the Champions League instead of the Europa League will be different. “We want to move up the league table so we can’t take our eye off the league and rest players like in the Europa League, there will be more demands on the players. “Next season will be even more testing. You have to get used to playing 45 to 50 games for this club every season. “It’s been a massive achievement; they are incredible. We have come so far as a team, and we’re building a culture. To win the game was massive mentally for them as well,” Solskjaer told a post-match press conference after the game.

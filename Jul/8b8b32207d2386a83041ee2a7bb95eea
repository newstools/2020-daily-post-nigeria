Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) has said that the life of Nigeria’s first female combat pilot, Tolulope Arotile, was cut. Forum Chairman and Ekiti Governor, Kayode Fayemi, said this in a statement on Thursday. Fayemi described late Arotile as a brilliant and promising officer. NGF noted that the deceased demonstrated a high sense of loyalty, patriotism and commitment to duty to Nigeria. The body regretted that “Arotile‘s life was cut in its prime and at a time she had so much to contribute to the upliftment of her country”. NGF said her demise was not only the family’s loss but that of the Nigerian Air Force, the government and people of Kogi State and the country. The governor prayed for the repose of her soul. He prayed that God would give her family and loved ones the strength to bear the loss. Nigerians have been calling for a probe of the offcer’s death. They insisted that NAF explanation that Arotile died when she was hit by “the reversing vehicle of an excited former Air Force Secondary School classmate” is unacceptable.

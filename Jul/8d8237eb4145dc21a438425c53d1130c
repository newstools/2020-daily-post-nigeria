Justice Kazeem Alogba, Chief Judge of Lagos State has sworn-in 5 presidents and 16 members to the bench of the State’s Customary Court. The ceremony took place at the premises of the Lagos State High Court in Ikeja on Tuesday, NAN reports. Alogba warned them to avoid conflict of interest while carrying out their duties. The CJ revealed that there had been complaints of customary courts’ presidents and members taking wives or husbands of litigants before them. Alogba said in dealing with family matters, inheritance matters, the appointees must exercise patience and the fear of God. “These are the areas where we usually have complaints. We get complaints about members and presidents taking over litigants’ wives, but I have implicit trust in you. You are all looking very handsome but please let that handsomeness tell in your work, not in other people’s wives. “As for the ladies, we used to hear of ladies taking litigants’ husbands too. And it is a fact. My fear about you too is not less than that I have about the male presidents, with all these your gorgeous hats and shiny dresses; but I pray that that beauty will be exhibited more in the judgments that you write”, he said. Alogba stated that a misdirected application of the exercise of their powers in any family matter, could mean a dislocation of an entire generation. Executive Secretary, Lagos State Judicial Service Commission, Bukola Salami, urged the new customary court presidents and members to always carry themselves with dignity. She warned of disciplinary action in events of proven allegations of misconduct.

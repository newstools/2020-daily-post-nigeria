Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), has warned that obstruction by trucks will affect the free flow of traffic on alternative routes as the Third Mainland Bridge in Lagos is partially closed. Mr Olajide Oduyoye, General Manager, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA), gave the warning on Saturday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. Recall that the third mainland bridge closed partially on Friday for repairs. Giving an update on the traffic situation in Lagos on the first day of the partial closure of the bridge, Oduyoye said that trucks en route Apapa ports parked on Ijora-Olopa and Costain area are impeding traffic for motorists desiring to connect Eko and Carter bridge. The LASTMA boss mentioned that the recent problem are those trailers parked by Ijora Olopa-Costain – that is a serious link between Carter Bridge and Eko Bridge. “It is imperative that those trucks are not parked there to reduce traffic.
“When you now have two trailers breaking down close to each other, it gets worse. “Our officers are on ground to manage the traffic as much as they can within the circumstances,” he added. The general manager advised the public to also help in the enforcement of proper parking of trucks. The LASTMA boss noted that impediments by trucks were not new to Lagos residents as they had been going on for long. Oduyoye lamented the attitude of truck drivers to LASTMA and appealed to the police to come in and prevent any chaotic situations. He added that priority had been given to traffic management in the morning peak period inward Lagos Island from the mainland and in the afternoon, outward Island to the mainland, in the partial closure arrangement. Oduyoye further urged motorists not to ignore road signs about diversion and drive against traffic.

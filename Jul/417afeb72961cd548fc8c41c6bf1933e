Arsenal is the latest club to enquire about Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish, according to Sky Sports.. Although the Gunners registered an interest in the midfielder, they did not follow up that enquiry. Villa remain adamant that Grealish is not for sale and they would not be tempted to sell for anything below £80m. It is believed that several clubs are willing to pay between £50m and £60m, but Villa would not be interested in doing a deal at that level. Arsenal’s summer transfer budget has been hit by their failure to qualify for the Champions League and COVID-19 outbreak. Grealish has three years left on his contract, but Villa may have been forced to sell him if they had been relegated this season. However, his goal in the 1-1 draw at West Ham on Sunday, kept them in the Premier League.

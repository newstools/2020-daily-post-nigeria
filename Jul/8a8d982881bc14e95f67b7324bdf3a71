Oyo State Government has appealed to members of the public to be wary of scammers circulating fake 2020/2021 recruitment forms into the Nigerian Army. Governor Seyi Makinde’s spokesman, Taiwo Adisa, said the administration had confirmed that the forms were fake. Adisa said the warning followed a letter of disclaimer from the Directorate of Army Recruitment Resettlement and Reserve (DARRR) to Secretary to the State Government, Olubamiwo Adeosun. The DARRR advised the state to alert indigenes and residents to the circulation of the fake recruitment form and an equally fake website: http.//recruitment.army.mil.ng. DARRR explained that Portal for Application Form for 80 Regular Recruits Intake was not yet opened. “The Directorate had also in the disclaimer informed members of the public to access all information relating to it through its official website: https://recruitment.army.mil.ng, warning them to be wary of fraudsters/scammers.” Oyo reminded the people not to fall victim of unscrupulous elements trying to hoodwink them into a bogus recruitment scheme.

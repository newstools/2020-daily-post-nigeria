There was a mild drama in Kano, as the State Managing Director of the Road Traffic Agency, KAROTA, vehemently turned down an alleged N500,000 bribe offered to him to allow the smuggled bar scale through the State. The Agency, intercepted a heavy-duty truck conveying alcohol worth Forty Million Naira (N40m) into the state, a situation which caused an uproar between the owners and the MD of the Traffic Agency, Baffa Babba DanAgundi. The trailer which was intercepted by KAROTA Personnel on Hadejia Road was subsequently driven to the KAROTA headquarters after the driver who tried to resist arrest was eventually subdued. Shortly after the arrest of the goods, some men who claim to be the owners of the confiscated drinks visited the Agency and attempted to bribe the Managing Director, Baffa Babba Dan’agundi with the sum of N500,000 to let go of their goods. Dan’agundi immediately contacted the Chairman, Kano State Public Complaints and Anti Corruption Commission Barrister Muhyi Magaji Rimin Gado who ordered their arrest and the transfer of the case to the commission for further investigation. The Managing Director of the Agency then ordered that the truck and its content be transferred to the Kano State Hisbah for further necessary action.

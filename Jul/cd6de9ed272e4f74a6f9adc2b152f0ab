Former Kaduna Central Senator, Shehu Sani has accused the suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu of running a cult in the agency. Sani claimed that some selected EFCC officers known as “Magu boys” or Chairman squad” operated the anti-graft agency with much impunity. The former lawmaker who is currently being prosecuted by the EFCC said the ”vicious and cruel” officers reported directly to Magu only. Sani, in a post on his official Facebook page, expressed the belief that some of the marginalized and honest officers in EFCC would soon come out. According to Sani: “Contrary to the facade you see from the Outside, the EFCC has been run by an inside cult called “the Magu Boys” or “the Chairman Squad.’ “They are a select cream of vicious and cruel officers who operate exclusively and with impunity and only report directly to their boss. “The inside cult is the dark and immoral aspect of the agency engaged in persecution, blackmail, frame-ups and cruelty. The cult has been the wheel behind the ordeal of their embattled Boss. Until they are rooted out from the agency also. “I believe a lot of revelations will be coming out from other marginalized and honest officers in the so-called anti-corruption agency.” A committee set up by the Presidency is currently probing Magu over allegations of corrupt practices. This followed an indictment by the Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. On Monday, Magu was picked up by security operatives said to be from the Department of State Services, DSS, and taken to the Presidential Villa, Abuja as part of the ongoing investigation. But, EFCC’s Head of Media and Publicity, Dele Oyewale, however, said Magu was invited for questioning.

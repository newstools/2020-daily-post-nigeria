Former Arsenal player, John Hartson has urged coach, Mikel Arteta, to sell David Luiz, Shkodran Mustafi and Sead Kolasinac this summer’s transfer window. Hartson believes Arteta needs to reshuffle his Arsenal defence this summer ahead of next season. He stated this ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Liverpool on Wednesday night. Arsenal head to the match after losing 2-1 to Tottenham Hotspur in their last Premier League fixture on Sunday. “Ideally, I would like to replace all three, [Shkodran] Mustafi, Kolasinac and [David] Luiz, but I don’t think he’s going to replace all three,” Hartson said as quoted by Metro UK. “For me, I would get rid of all three [defenders] if I possibly could, but I don’t think that’s going to happen, but, all three of them I’m not sure they’d get in any of the top four teams.”

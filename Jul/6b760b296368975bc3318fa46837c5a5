The minister made the announcement in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Anthony Ogunleye, on Tuesday in Abuja. Bello explained that the decision was reached at a meeting between the FCT administration and members of delegation from the FCT League of Imams Initiative led by its Chairman, Imam Tajudeen Adigun, NAN reports. He also said that the meeting discussed the modalities of holding Eid prayers for the upcoming Eid-il-Kabir celebrations. The minister said all worshippers are enjoined to hold Eid prayers in the premises of their neighbourhood Juma’at mosques. He noted that Eid prayers should last for a maximum of one hour only between 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. Bello said that all other Eid celebrations and activities should be confined to homes as the extant guidelines on the closure of public parks, recreation, entertainment and sporting areas still subsist. He advised all religious authorities to regulate the flow of people entering and exiting places of worship. The minister reiterated that all other health and safety protocols regarding places of worship as earlier issued by the FCTA remain in effect.

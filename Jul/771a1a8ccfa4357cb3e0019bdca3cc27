A Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan, on Friday, dissolved a 22-year-old marriage between one Lateef Rufai, a bricklayer, and Filicia on the grounds of frequent nagging, NAN reports. Lateef who resides in the Ologuneru area of Ibadan while presenting his case in court said that his wife capitalized on his physical challenge to inflict more pains on him. ”I am swamped with the reports of how Filicia beats my neighbors. In fact, we were forced to move out of our rented apartment as a result. “The situation was the same when we moved into our own house. Filicia has considerably slowed down my progress in life because she keeps frustrating the opportunities in my business; which is driving away my customers,” he said. His wife objected to the dissolution and denied all the allegations leveled against her. She also told the court that she had nowhere to go because no one from her family ever separated from their husbands. “I have shown my husband love until his first wife moved back into the house. I also stayed by my husband’s side when he had an accident that led to his physical challenge. “Besides, I have suffered from depression. All that Lateef wants to do is to sell his second house in Ilesa Town where my children and I live, to leave me hopeless and in extreme poverty. “I don’t fight with people,” she said. However, Ademola Odunade, the President of the Court while delivering his judgment said that he dissolved the marriage to forestall a situation that might result in loss of life. He also awarded custody of the first three children to the husband while the wife takes care of the last because he is still very young. According to him, Lateef will be paying N5,000 as the child’s monthly feeding allowance. He also ordered Lateef to pay N12,000 to enable Filicia to pay for accommodation and another N5,000 to move her things.

A former Chelsea left-back, Ashley Cole has blamed defender, Marcos Alonso, for West Ham United’s third goal following the Blues’ 3-2 defeat to David Moyes’ side in the Premier League on Wednesday night at the London Stadium. Willian gave Chelsea the lead in the 42nd minute when he scored from the penalty spot before the Hammers struck twice through Tomas Soucek and Michail Antonio. Willian again equalized for Chelsea with a fantastic free-kick, but it was West Ham who secured three points when Andriy Yarlomenko managed to beat Antonio Rudiger and finish past Kepa Arrizabalaga with a left-footed finish in the 89th minute. But Cole believes Alonso’s poor defensive work cost Frank Lampard’s side to lose all three points against the host. “Chelsea will be disappointed,” Cole told Sky Sports. “The thing I hate about full-backs is they are happy to run forward but not trackback. “Chelsea FC needed a point here. A point would have been a good result for them. “Could Alonso have tracked back? Could he have anticipated earlier? Could he have shown the same intensity to get back as he did to get forward? Yes. Alonso needs to run back quicker.” “Chelsea had a lot of possession,” Cole added. “They could not break West Ham down. Chelsea would have expected to win coming off the pitch, Frank [Lampard] will be fuming with how Chelsea have defended.” Chelsea’s next Premier League fixture is against Watford on Saturday.

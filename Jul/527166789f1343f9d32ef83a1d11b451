Stern looking security operatives on Tuesday morning took over the complex of the Ondo State House of Assembly. With about 10 vans belonging to the men of the Nigeria Police and the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, the security operatives mounted strategic locations within and outside the Assembly. Meanwhile, journalists who were at the complex to monitor the dayâ€™s proceedings were turned back by the security personnel.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813849" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CD1DF827-85E4-4994-B06A-8A7EA27B892D.png" alt="" width="720" height="443" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CD1DF827-85E4-4994-B06A-8A7EA27B892D.png 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CD1DF827-85E4-4994-B06A-8A7EA27B892D-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> One of the security operatives told DAILY POST exclusively that the directive was given by the leadership of the house. He added that only three journalists from government-owned medium will be allowed to cover the proceedings. The sitting might not be unconnected with the plan to begin impeachment proceeding against the embattled deputy governor of the state, Agboola Ajayi.

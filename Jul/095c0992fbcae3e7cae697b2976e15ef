Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has labelled the team “weak” after a 2-1 loss to Osasuna saw Real Madrid crowned LaLiga champions. Zinedine Zidane’s men defeated Villarreal 2-1 to win their first domestic title since 2017. Real are now seven points clear at the top of the table with one round of fixtures left. Messi admitted Madrid deserve credit for winning all 10 games since La Liga’s resumption in June, to stop Barca from making it three titles in a row. However, he was unhappy with his side’s performances. “We didn’t expect or want it to end in this way, but it’s a reflection of our season,” Messi told Movistar after Osasuna ended Barca’s 42-game unbeaten run at Camp Nou in the league. “[We’ve been] an inconsistent, weak team that has been beaten in intensity and desire. It has been easy to score goals against us. “Madrid did what they had to do. They haven’t lost a game since the restart, which deserves credit, but we have helped them by dropping points we should not have dropped.”

Wife to Peter Okoye, Lola, has shared her experience with coronavirus. Lola Okoye in a video shared on her Instagram page on Wednesday said she went through so much pain while battling with COVID-19. Recall that her husband, Peter of the defunct Psquare had few days ago revealed that his entire family including his domestic staff tested positive for the virus. But narrating her experience, Lola said it was a painful one and she wishes no one including her worst enemy passes through such. “I do not wish COVID-19 upon my worst enemy and I need to let everybody known that COVID-19 is real. I suffered, I went through a lot of pain, I watched my family go through it. She advised Nigerians to load up on vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin B, and zinc. ” I am so grateful to God Almighty. My love and prayers are with those currently battling this disease, you are not alone. “We need to keep our parents safe. Please encourage older people to stay at home. Please stay home. She added that the healing from the virus is slow but a hopeful one as she advised Nigerians to be careful as coronavirus is 100% real.

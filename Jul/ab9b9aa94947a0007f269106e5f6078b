Residents of Abakaliki, Ebonyi State capital on Friday have lamented the fraudulent extortion of candidates by vendors who guide them in the N-Power programme registration process. DAILY POST reports that there is a proliferation of N-Power registration centres in almost every street of Abakaliki, the state capital. A victim who spoke to our reporter said she was charged five thousand naira (N5000) for N-Power registration only. She stated further that after the registration, she was equally asked to pay another one thousand five hundred naira for a printout. Investigation revealed that some of the victims after paying the charges did not even receive messages to show that the registration was submitted successfully. Another source who gave his name as Ogodo said “I went to one of the N-Power registration centres to register for my wife, and I paid money. “People in business centres collected money from me and gave me a printout. Then after that, they sent text to me to come to the international market and collect another printout.

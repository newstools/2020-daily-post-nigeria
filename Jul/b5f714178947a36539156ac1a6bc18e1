Emeka Okoroafor, the member representing Isuikwuato constituency in Abia State House of Assembly has expressed concern over alleged marginalization of his constituents in infrastructural amenities by the government. Okoroafor made his feelings known, on Monday, during the house’s plenary session on the urgent need to fix failed spots on Uzuakoli -Ahaba Imenyi section of Umuahia-Uzuakoli-Ahaba Imenyi-Ohafia -Arochukwu Road. The lawmaker explained that despite several interventions of the State government in the area of road construction, the people of Isiukwuato local government area was yet to feel the impact. “I’m afraid of possible unrest by the good people of Isiukwuato if something is not done urgently”. Okorofafor, however, asked the house to mandate the State Government to direct the Ministry of Joint Projects or any agency responsible for management and execution of projects with the fund to as a matter of urgency and importance, mobilize to site and fix the failed portions of the road without delay. Also contributing, the Speaker of the Abia House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Chinedum Orji cautioned against staging civil unrest and appealed for urgent intervention on the affected roads. DAILY POST reports that the Abia State House of Assembly, however, resolved to draw the attention of the Federal Road Maintenance Agency, (FERMA), to the deplorable state of the roads, while also urging the Abia State Road Maintenance Agency,(ABROMA), to carry out palliative work on the dilapidated roads.

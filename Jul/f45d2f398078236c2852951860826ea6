Manchester United will not be extending the current loan deals for Alexis Sanchez and Chris Smalling with Inter Milan and Roma respectively, Sky Sports reports. The Red Devils are unwilling to extend both playersâ€™ loans into next season or have them stay out on loan any further than the current arrangement. Instead, the Premier League side is looking to reach deals for permanent transfers. Smalling and Sanchez originally signed one-year loans,expiring in June, but following the COVID-19 break, they had their stints in Italy extended until the first week of August in order to be able to play out the end of the Serie A season. Under the current agreement, the two players will return to Old Trafford after the last Serie A match-day scheduled for August 2. This means that neither will be able to play in the final stages of the Europa League. Roma and Inter have not played their round of 16 one-legged ties against Sevilla and Getafe respectively, with the original first-leg ties in March being postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic in Italy and Spain.

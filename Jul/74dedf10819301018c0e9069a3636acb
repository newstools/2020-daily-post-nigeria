The Army has tagged the killings in Southern Kaduna as reprisal killings perpetrated by Kataf youths, Fulani militias and the criminal elements of both sides. This is according to the Commander of Operation Safe Haven, Chukwuemeka Okonkwo who briefed newsmen on Tuesday, following a security meeting at the Kaduna State Government House. The meeting had in attendance the Governor of the State, Nasir El-Rufai and representatives of security agencies in the state. Okonkwo also blamed the media for the one-sided narrative in the conflict which many have labelled ethnic cleansing. He said “What we have were attacks on some communities and reprisal attacks. “The reports are not balanced. Perhaps, most of the media houses don’t know, both sides are actually involved. ‘’You have Kataf youths, Fulani militias and the criminal elements of both sides. Some people are also leveraging on the security situation to perpetuate their criminal activities, aside communities involved in the crisis,’’ Mr. Okonkwo added. He explained that “any incident is enough to spark off crisis in that area, there have been lingering disputes and animosities, banditry and cattle rustling there.’’

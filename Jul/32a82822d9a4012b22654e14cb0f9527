Nigerian suspected fraudster, Ramon Abbas, popularly known as Hushpuppi has been denied bail in the United States. DAILY POST had reported that his lawyer, Gal Pissetzky had said that his client was kidnapped by the FBI from Dubai and taken to the US. Pissetzky also insisted that his job as an Instagram celebrity paid for the $10,000 monthly rent on his luxury Dubai flat. His lawyer applied for him to leave jail with an electronic tag and live with the uncle, but US prosecutors opposed the bail application. According to the UAE’s The National, the prosecutors said he could commit crimes with just a smartphone and an internet connection and that he posed too much of a flight risk. Reacting to prosecutors’ argument, Pissetzky said his client had too much to lose if he flees from the United States. “He is loved, respected and he is a celebrity. “I don’t see the reason why he would want to ruin his credibility in the world and his status rather than stay here and face this allegation. “Anywhere he goes, people will know. ”Having grown up very poor in Nigeria, Mr. Abbas is now paid to pose with high-priced items such as Louis Vuitton bags that people would buy after seeing his posts on Instagram. “He is an influencer. That’s a job today, as much as it is hard to imagine this is actually a full-time job,” Pissetzky said. However, Judge Jeffrey Gilbert denied Hushpuppi bail on grounds of him being a flight risk. Gilbert also ordered that the suspected Nigerian fraudster be remanded in custody until he is taken to a court in California.

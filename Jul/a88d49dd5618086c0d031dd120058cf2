Manchester City has confirmed the signing of young Mechelen defender, Issa Kabore. He is the first player to join the club this summer transfer window. The 19-year-old right-back played five times for Mechelen in the Belgium Jupiler Pro League last season. His outstanding performance impressed Pep Guardiola’s side to add him to their ranks. The Burkinabé signed a five-year contract at the Etihad but remain at Mechelen for the 2020/21 season. Manchester City announced completion of deal on Wednesday with little fanfare. Mechelen Sporting Director, Tom Caluwe expressing his delight at being able to keep Kabore at the club for another year, said, “This is a win-win situation for all parties. The player himself dreams of the Premier League and can calmly prepare for that step with us. “City has a clear path in mind and indicated that our club is important for the further development of Kaboré. And this way we can still keep Issa in Mechelen.”

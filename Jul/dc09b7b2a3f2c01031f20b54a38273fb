The All Progressives Congress (APC) has assured all Nigerians that President Muhammad Buhari will not condole any form of corrupt practices. The party stated that the administration was committed to fighting graft. APC said this in reaction to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) comment about alleged corrupt practices in the government. The ruling party noted that “the PDP is the founder of corruption in Nigeria, to the extent that the evil practices were made an official way of life during its 16 wasteful years”. The spokesman stressed that in the APC government, “nobody is above the law”. Nabena said the investigation of the acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, “should send a signal to all those who think and have blackmailed the government’s anti-corruption battle”. He added that the presidency has assured that there is no hiding place for any corrupt government official. Nabena told Nigerians to ignore “the fake lamentations of an unrepentant corrupt PDP”. APC said the opposition party is only pained that it is no longer in government. “PDP does not have a history of caring for the people even when the revenue generations were at the highest levels”, the party said.

Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has congratulated the President, African Development Bank (AfDB), Dr Akinwumi Adesina on his clearance after a corruption probe by an independent review panel. DAILY POST had reported that the panel found out that the allegations against Adesina were properly considered and dismissed by the Committee. The Governor in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase said the exoneration from the 16 allegations levelled against Adesina confirms the fact that he has distinguished himself as an honest and transparent administrator who has creditably led AfDB. Ortom described the outcome of the independent panel’s review as an attestation of Adesina’s competence to head the bank for another term. According to him, having worked with Dr Adesina in the Federal Executive Council as Ministers and known that he is a man of probity and enviable reputation, he was optimistic that a review of the report by the group which accused the AfDB President of corruption would be proved wrong. He, however, encouraged Adesina to consider the development as an inspiration to offer greater service to the African continent and its partners through the bank. Ortom wished the AfDB President a hitch-free re-election next month and a successful second tenure.

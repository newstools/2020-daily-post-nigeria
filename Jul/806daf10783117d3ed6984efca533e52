The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, has called on Ibrahim Magu, suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, to resign as head of the anti-graft commission. HURIWA explained that Magu’s immediate resignation would salvage the image and reputation of EFCC from further damage. The prominent rights group made the call in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Emmanuel Onwubiko and National Director of Media, Zainab Yusuf. HURIWA warned that Magu’s return to EFCC would make a mockery of President Muhammadu Buhari’s fight against corruption. HURIWA also called for a probe into assets forfeited while Magu was still in office. The statement reads: “HURIWA calls on the suspended EFCC Acting Chairman; Ibrahim Magu to resign so as not to destroy what is left of the reputation of the anti-graft agency and the urgent need to expand the scope of investigation on all the cases of assets forfeiture including the serious claim by Chief Emmanuel Nwude that the EFCC under Ibrahim Magu allegedly cornered his assets that were not part of the originally listed assets to be forfeited in the judgment of the Lagos High Court when he was convicted for advance fees fraud including houses of his original family built long before he had issues with the law.” The rights group also called on Buhari to ensure the independence of key anti-corruption institutions in the country. Magu was suspended by an investigative panel headed by Justice Ayo Salami, following an indictment by the Attorney General of the Federation, AGF, and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami. He was accused of corruption, insubordination, mismanagement of recovered loots among other allegations.

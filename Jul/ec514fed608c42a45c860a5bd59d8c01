Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has spoken of his pride in his players, following a 2-0 win over Manchester City in the FA Cup semi final on Saturday. Gunners captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored twice in each half, to shock Pep Guardiola’s side who dominated possession. The win was symbolic for Arteta, who had served as Guardiola’s assistant at The Etihad. “Extremely happy and proud of the players. “When you play this team, you have to give your best and when you have the opportunities you must make the most of them. “There is a great chemistry between them [the players] and they really believe in what we are trying to do,” Arteta told the media afterwards. Arsenal will now face either Manchester United or Chelsea in the August 1 final.

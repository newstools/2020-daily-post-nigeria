The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has advised the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, to pick Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitemer or Tammy Baldwin as his running mate if he must defeat President Donald Trump in the presidential election. In a statement he made available to DAILY POST on Sunday, Ayodele noted that the choice of Biden’s running mate will have a lot to do in determining his victory in the election. “Those that can make him win are Kamala Harris, Gretchen Whitemer, Tammy Baldwin and Michelle Obama, if he can choose between them he will be victorious. Democrats will take over from Republicans,’’ he declared. The spiritual leader further advised Biden to stay focused at all times and must not take any time to relax because it is dangerous. He noted that “Donald Trump will come back with a big strategy and scandal three weeks to the election, hence the need for a very strategic planning ‘Joe Biden must focus and work on the mistakes of Donald Trump to be victorious. He must not relax at any time because Trump will come up with a very strong strategy three weeks to the election and it can give him victory but if he can stand very firm, he will be victorious.

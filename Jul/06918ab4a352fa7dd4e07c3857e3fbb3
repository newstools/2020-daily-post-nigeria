Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State, on Wednesday, said Chief Olusegun Osoba’s journey through life, in the past 81 years, has been strewn with honour, dignity, sacrifice, selflessness, and dedication to worthy causes. Osoba was the Governor of Ogun State from 1999 to 2003. As the octogenarian marks his 81st birthday, Abiodun, in a statement he signed personally, said he could not do without celebrating Osoba’s “unwavering commitment to participatory democracy”, which he said has over the time helped to build strong institutions in the country. “We are so very proud of your uncommon pedigree as a thoroughbred reporter, editor, administrator, astute politician and statesman,” he said. The Governor proceeded by cherishishing Osoba’s “wealth of experience, exemplary leadership and the rich heritage”, which he said the former governor had bequeathed to the Gateway State. “At a time like this, we cannot but celebrate your unwavering commitment to participatory democracy which has over the time helped to build strong institutions in the country. “On behalf of the good people of Ogun State, my family, political associates, party stalwarts and faithful, I wish you many happy returns in sound health, Baba,” Gov Abiodun said.

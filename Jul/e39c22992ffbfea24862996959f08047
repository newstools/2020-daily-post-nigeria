The All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Edo State, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has said that Governor Godwin Obaseki receives N600 million monthly as security vote. Ize-Iyamu claimed that the governor gives the police only N5 million. He spoke during a live broadcast on his Facebook page on Monday. The APC flag bearer pledged to dedicate more resources to combating insecurity. He queried the present administration’s sincerity towards safeguarding lives and property. “The present government has not been able to show serious commitment to security funding. Every month, the governor collects over N600 million as security vote and gives the police N5 million, not even enough to fuel vehicles,” he said. Ize-Iyamu expressed concerns about how Edo seems to be the only state in the South-South that has not made adequate investments in technology to combat crime. “In this age, what is our investment in technology? Edo State might be the only state in the South-South that does not have trackers that can be used to trace kidnappers. The government must show sincerity in combating crime”, the candidate stressed.

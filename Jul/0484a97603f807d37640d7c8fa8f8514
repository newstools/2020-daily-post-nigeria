Pan Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohaneze Ndigbo and the separatist Igbo group, Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) have mended fences, with a promise to work together for the common good of Igbo people. Both groups met on Tuesday at the home of the First Republic Aviation Minister, Chief Mbazuluike Amechi in Ukpor, Nnewi South Local Government Area of Anambra State. Both groups have been at daggers drawn in recent times, with the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu calling on his members to attack the leader of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Dr. Nnia Nwodo, anywhere he is seen. But Amechi who met with the group described the rivalry as unnecessary as they were both working for the good of Igbo people. “I summoned the two bodies to express my displeasure with what I have been reading in the newspapers about Kanu giving orders for the stoning of Chief Nwodo. “I’m happy that even before this peace meeting, Kanu has retracted the statement. We, therefore, appeal to Nwodo to accept the retraction and get it off his mind as IPOB has agreed to work with them. “The two bodies must realize that it is the same battle they are fighting, which is marginalization, killings and denial of the Federal Government to develop South East and Igbo land in general. IPOB, represented by Aloy Ejimakor, counsel to Nnamdi Kanu said he was at the meeting with the blessings and instructions of his client, just as he thanked Amaechi who he said was not a stranger to what he was doing having been once declared a terrorist. Also, speaking on behalf of Ohaneze Ndigbo, Anambra State President of the body, Chief Damian Okeke-Ogene, said the body endorsed all that was contained in the communique. He said, “Those who thought our fences are fallen will know that the fences are much stronger than they thought.”

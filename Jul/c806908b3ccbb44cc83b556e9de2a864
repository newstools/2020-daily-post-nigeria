The federal government has been warned against the possible pollution of boreholes across the country by body fluids from dead people in graveyards. A group, Waterwell Drilling Rig Owners and Practitioners say its warning follows the government’s failure to regulate the water industry, which has led to the arbitrary construction of boreholes more than enough for the country. President of the group, Micheal Ale, while addressing newsmen, said there was a need for boreholes in schools and other public places to make water available for resuming students and many other Nigerians. Ale said the present COVID-19 pandemic bedevilling the world had shown that government must take up the challenge of providing running water in public places. Ale said with the COVID-19 pandemic presently ravaging the world government, corporate and concerned individuals must do more in providing clean drinking. He noted that there is an urgent need for the government to not only regulate the water industry but check the ongoing arbitrary proliferation of boreholes. He said: ”l want everyone to know that Safe water is a resource. That is why there is an establishment of water resources, I want all to understand that God is magnanimous enough to let us have the rains for free, but he hid a particular resource under the ground. That is underground water. What is not controlled is not valued, every one of us having indiscriminate activities to getting water is our fault, the fault is when the resource is not controlled by the relevant organs of government. According to him, only about 54% of the Nigerian population presently have access to potable water while the other 46% are at danger of unclean water. So, my assessment is that we are not moving forward” “Now, with the COVID-19 pandemic, it tells us that we need to do more to save lives by having running potable water. We are looking at 100% access by 2030 and it is achievable if we put things right.

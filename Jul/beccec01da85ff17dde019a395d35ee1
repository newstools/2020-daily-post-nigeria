by Obiweluozo Martins Arsenal have qualified for the FA Cup final, following an impressive 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored once in either half to shock Pep Guardiola’s men at Wembley Stadium. City began strongly, dominating with possession. But it was Aubameyang who opened scoring, poking home a Nicolas Pepe cross in the 17th minute. The Gabon striker ran onto Kieran Tierney’s pass with 18 minutes left to seal a famous win. The Gunners’ victory ended Guardiola’s chances of winning three trophies this season following last campaign’s domestic treble. Arsenal, who have won the FA Cup for a record 13 times, will play either Chelsea or Manchester United in the final on August 1.

South-East Governors Forum says compulsory COVID-19 tests will be conducted on teachers before schools in the region reopen. Forum Chairman and Ebonyi Governor, Dave Umahi, made the disclosure at a media briefing on Sunday. He said there were fears for kindergarten and primary school pupils who do not understand what is social distancing. “How many of our schools have running water and how many sanitisers have been provided for them?” He asked. Umahi noted that it is the rainy season and most schools are bushy due to abandonment since the coronavirus outbreak. He revealed that the forum would review school infrastructure to support Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC) guidelines ahead of the federal government’s decision on re-opening. “We will then review our position and tell our people the safest time to re-open schools with our health workers to enforce the NCDC protocols,” Umahi added.

The Zamfara State Police Command has beefed up security around the Emir of Shinkafi, Alhaji Muhammad Makwashi. This is to forestall breakdown of law and order over traditional title of Sadauki (Defender) conferred on former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, by the emirate council. Police Public Relations Officer, SP Mohammed Shehu, spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Gusau on Sunday. He said the Emir’s security was improved since Friday, after the emirate learned that some people were planning to lead a demonstration within Shinkafi. Shehu disclosed that officials wrote to the Police Command seeking protection and to avert violence. The PPRO noted that patrol teams are around Shinkafi area so that peace and order can be maintained. “The Commissioner of Police, Mr. Usman Nagogo has always warned people from taking the law into their own hands. “If anyone has grudges against any other person or persons, there are established legal channels to take such grudges to, including going to the courts. We will not allow anyone to cause trouble,” he explained. Shehu clarified that what was happening in Shinkafi was not “house arrest” of Makwashi as being speculated but protection.

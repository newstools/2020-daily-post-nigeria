An All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Ondo, Olusola Oke, has condemned the party’s adoption of indirect mode of primary. Oke is regarded as the main challenger to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu ahead of the July 20 exercise. APC Primary Election Committee chairman, Governor Yahaya Bello, had declared that aspirants cannot dictate to the party. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has confirmed APC’s choice of primary on its website. But all aspirants, except Akeredolu, prefer the direct mode which allows all card-carrying members to vote. On Friday, Oke, in reaction to the APC reconciliation meeting, disclosed that he might challenge the indirect mode of primary. He said the committee cannot achieve much as the party already announced the type of primary to be conducted. Oke added that he would not boycott the primary, so that he could have locus standi to challenge it. “I don’t boycott any election. It is not in my character and is not advisable. Under the electoral law if you boycott or you don’t participate, you cannot challenge,” NAN quoted him as saying.

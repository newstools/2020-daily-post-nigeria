National Assembly Service Commission (NASC) has appointed Ojo Amos Olatunde as the Acting Clerk of the National Assembly (CNA), The Cable reports. The former clerk Mohammed Sani-Omolori had been removed for refusing to retire after 35 years in service. Omolori had argued via a press release, insisting his time was not up yet.

The ousted clerk was given 24 hours to explain why disciplinary action should not be taken against him. “As you are very much aware, the Clerk to the National Assembly is an employee of the National Assembly Service Commission, vide Section 6(1)b of the National Assembly Service Act, 2014 (As amended). “Your press release is considered by the Commission as gross insubordination to a constituted authority”, it read.

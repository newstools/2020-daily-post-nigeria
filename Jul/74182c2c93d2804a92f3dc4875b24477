Arsenal legend, Martin Keown, has urged Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, that he must not try his back three experiments if he wants to beat Leicester City at the King Power Stadium in the Premier League on Sunday. According to Keown, Solskjaer must stick to the formation that saw the Red Devils go on an 18-match unbeaten run, before it was ended by Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final last weekend. Man United must only avoid defeat against Leicester to confirm their place in next season’s Champions League. “As for United, we saw how Ole Gunnar Solskjaer surprisingly opted for a back three in their FA Cup semi-final against Chelsea last weekend,” Keown wrote in his column for the Daily Mail. “The experiment failed, and now United should be going back to what they know works. “That is a 4-2-3-1 with Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic as the two deep midfielders and Bruno Fernandes at No 10.” Man United have not lost to Leicester in their last 11 matches against the Foxes. Meanwhile, Solskjaer has since insisted that United will be going for the win at Leicester.

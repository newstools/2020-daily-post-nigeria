A forty-seven-year-old man, Eronmosele Mamoud from Etsako, Edo State is now in detention at the State Criminal Investigation Department, Port Harcourt for impregnating his sixteen-year-old daughter. Eronmosele who confessed to the crime in an interview with newsmen at the Rivers State Police Headquarters, Port Harcourt said he started defiling his daughter since she was 11. The man said he was usually under a trance or spiritual possession that drives him to defile his daughter. He said he willingly confessed to the crime and is ready to bear the consequences of his action, just as he pleaded that the baby his 16-year-old daughter is carrying should not be aborted. “This is a battle that I have tried to fight over the years and it seems to be much bigger than me because I look at my daughter and I won’t know what is happening to me. “And even my daughter, I don’t know what is involved with her too because the thing looks like a spiritual problem. It happens to me as if I am in a trance. “I decided to submit myself because I don’t want to do it anymore. If my going to prison will liberate her, good and fine. But my happiness is that I am relieved,” he said. Spokesman of the Rivers state Police Command, SP Nnamdi Omoni said the suspect will be charged to court soon.

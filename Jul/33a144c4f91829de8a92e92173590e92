Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has named Mateo Kovacic and Fikayo Tomori as the players that will miss his side’s Premier League clash against Watford on Saturday night at Stamford Bridge. According to Lampard, Kovacic hurt his Achilles during Chelsea Premier League clash against West Ham United, while Tomori lacked match fitness. The Blues boss said this on Friday during his pre-match press conference. Chelsea lost 3-2 against West Ham United in their last fixture on Wednesday. “Kovacic is going to be out of this game,” Chelsea’s official website quoted Lampard as saying. “He hurt his Achilles during the West Ham game and will miss this one, possibly the next one after that, but hopefully it won’t be too long after that.” Lampard added: “Fikayo is still not fit. He’s hopefully going to be training with us somewhere through next week. “He’s doing a lot of work but in terms of the last bit to get him on the training pitch, it’s been tough.” The match is scheduled at 8 pm, Nigerian time.

Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has admitted that Eden Hazard is not happy with the outcome of his debut season at the club. Hazard will miss their LaLiga clash with Athletic Club on Sunday as he is not fully fit. The Belgium international picked up a knock in the 1-0 victory over Espanyol and missed the win against Getafe on Thursday. Madrid could extend their lead over Barcelona at the top of the table to seven points if they win at Athletic before the Catalans face Villarreal. But Zidane is not ready to take any unnecessary risks with Hazard, which could jeopardise his chances of finishing the season. “For Eden, it’s his first year and he wants to help the team. And when he can’t do that, he’s not happy. “I don’t think he’s afraid [of injuries]; what he wants is to be good enough to play. If he doesn’t look 100 percent, it’s a problem for him and for everyone, because we love him to the max,” Zidane told a press conference on Saturday. Hazard has endured a hard time with injuries since his €100million move from Chelsea, with the 29-year-old having started only 13 league games so far.

Bashir Ahmaad, the Personal Assistant on New Media to the President Muhammadu Buhari, has reacted to former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, returning to the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Friday. Dogara had left the APC for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2019 general elections, along with former President of the Senate, Bukola Saraki and some governors. He was later re-elected into the House of Representatives on the platform of the PDP in 2019. But, Dogara returned to the ruling APC after he visited Buhari in the company of the Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Committee, Mai Mala Buni on Friday. Ahmaad tweeted: “That’s purely politics, no rule is broken here, Obaseki left and Dogara is back. “That’s the law of this game, when you leave; another will come and fill the space. “And it will continue to be like that till the end of the game. The best, don’t stress yourself over it. Be moderate!”

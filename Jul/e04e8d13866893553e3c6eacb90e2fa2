Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has admitted that Liverpool’s team over the past two seasons, has been the toughest opponent he has ever played against. Liverpool snatched the Premier League title from City this season, finishing 18 points clear at the top. Last season, the Reds also won the Champions League, UEFA Super Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup. “Yes, by a big margin, the toughest rival I have faced in my career was the Liverpool team of last year and this season,” Guardiola told DAZN Spain. “If you let them to dominate you, they will cage you and you don’t come out. When you dominate them, they find running spaces like no one else does. “They are very fast at going back. They are very strong in terms of strategy. Their players are mentally very strong. It’s the rival that I’ve had to think more about how to defeat them.”

Suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Ibrahim Magu, has denied giving N4 billion to Vice President, Yemi Osinabjo. He said this when he appeared before the presidential panel investigating him on Thursday. Magu has spent the fourth day at the Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID). A source disclosed to The Nation what Magu said when he was grilled about Osinbajo. Magu was quoted as saying: “I did not tell the panel that I gave the Vice President N4 billion” He quipped: “Where will I get such money? Do I have access to such funds? It is part of mudslinging. Please clear this. I do not have any control of such cash, I did not order the transfer of N4 billion to the VP or to anybody.” Magu insisted that Osinbajo’s name “never came up at the panel’s session at all. Since the VP was not an issue, I could not have mentioned that I gave him N4 billion”. Meanwhile, the VP has asked the Inspector-General of Police to investigate the allegation against him. His demand was contained in a July 9 petition signed by his lawyers, Taiwo Osipitan and Abimbola Kayode.

Dejan Lovren has left Liverpool for Zenit Saint Petersburg for a fee of around £11m. The newly-crowned Premier League champions confirmed this via Twitter on Monday, a day after the final round of fixtures were played. “We can confirm Lovren has joined Zenit Saint Petersburg on a permanent transfer. “Everyone at the Reds would like to thank Dejan for his brilliant contribution over the years and wish him all the very best in his new challenge,” the tweet read. Jan Vertonghen also announced his exit from Tottenham after eight years at the North London side. The Belgium defender, whose contract was extended in June until the end of the current season, made more than 300 appearances for Spurs after joining the club from Ajax in 2012. “So my time at the club comes to an end. A sad day for many reasons. “I will miss the friends I’ve made here, the staff that make the club run, playing at the amazing new stadium & of course you fans,” Vertonghen tweeted.

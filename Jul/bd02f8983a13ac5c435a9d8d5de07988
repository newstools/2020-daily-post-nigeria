Majority Leader of the Ondo State House of Assembly, Jamiu Maito, has resigned. His letter of resignation was read by the Clerk of the House, Bode Adeyelu, during a plenary session on Wednesday. The legislature is in crisis over the impeachment process against Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi. On June 21, Ajayi defected to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Since then, the plot to remove him from office heightened. Ajayi, who openly labeled Governor Rotimi Akeredolu an “emperor”, is now seeking the PDP governorship ticket. If he succeeds, he will face Akeredolu in what would be an epic battle. On Tuesday, the APC national leadership referred to Ajayi as “former Deputy Governor” Also today, the Deputy Speaker, Iroju Ogundeji, and another member, Adewale Williams, were suspended. They were sanctioned for “unruly behaviour”. The duo were among the nine lawmakers who refused to sign the impeachment notice against Ajayi. On Monday, Ifedayo Abegunde resigned as the Secretary to the State Government. Hours after he left, Abegunde made an explosive statement. The politician revealed that Governor Akeredolu was rigged into power and that he lost the 2016 election to PDP candidate Eyitayo Jegede. Jegede, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), was the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice when Segun Mimiko was Ondo Governor.

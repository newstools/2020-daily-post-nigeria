Manchester United have begun talks with Bayern Munich over a possible deal for Kingsley Coman, The Athletic reports. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is eager to bolster their wide options ahead of next season and Coman is one of the players he is considering. The France winger is seen as an alternative, if they are unable to secure a deal for their primary target, Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho. Sancho has been heavily linked to United for some time, but United are likely to face serious competition for the England international. Dortmund are also asking for around £100million for Sancho, a figure United may be unable to meet. As a result, Coman, who has seven goals and seven assists in 35 appearances across all competitions this season, could be a more feasible option.

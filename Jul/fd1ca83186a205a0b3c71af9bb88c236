The Special Adviser to Governor Ben Ayade on Forest Security, Thomas Obi Taiwo popularly referred to as General Iron has opened up on how over eleven persons in Boki were killed. Taiwo told DAILY POST in Calabar on Thursday that three women suspected to be witches confessed that they killed three men in Oku in Boki Local Government of Cross River State through alleged witchcraft. Three Chiefs and others were also burnt to death in the Oku community in Boki Local Government Area of Cross River State over allegations of witchcraft and wizardry. It was learned that among those killed was Chief Benard Kekong who was a former manager, Boki Oil Palm Estate in Borum. He died an hour after he was burnt. The victims, it was gathered, were accused of being witches and wizards in the Oku community in Boki Local Government Area of the State. But Taiwo regretted the incident which occurred in the area explaining that trouble started when three women confessed that they had killed three young men, Emman Atom, Asu Otu and Asu Caliphonia, using witchcraft. Taiwo said youths in the community lynched the victims after they confessed to the alleged crime. “When that event took place, I was in Ogoja and they called me from there on phone that my community was on fire, that I should come back immediately, so I rushed up and come When I came, I began to cool down tempers and begged the youths not to take laws into their hands and they should allow the government to investigate the matter through the Police”. Taiwo, however, accused the state government of not implementing the promises made to the youths of the area, a situation that could have led to their restlessness, he alleged. “Government promised to train youths and empower about 500 of them but as we are speaking, nothing of such has happened.

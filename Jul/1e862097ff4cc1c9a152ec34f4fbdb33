Manchester United gaffer, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has warned his players to be aware of Aston Villa star, Jack Grealish’s threat when both teams clash in the Premier League on Thursday night at Villa Park. According to Solskjaer, Grealish likes to attract players to himself and creates space for others. The Norwegian said this at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. Recall that Grealish was outstanding as Aston Villa played 2-2 draw against Man United in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford last December. “I think the last game obviously caused us some problems, both Grealish off the left and [Anwar] El Ghazi off the right,” Solskjaer said. “He scored a fantastic goal. There have been lots said and talked about him, and we need to be aware of him. “Whoever is close to him, if he is off the left, in the middle or on the right. What he does is attract players to him and creates space for others. “It is not just one player in that Villa team. There are many of them.” Man United heads to the game after beating Bournemouth 5-2 in their previous game, while Aston Villa lost 2-0 to Premier League champions, Liverpool. The match kick-off time is at 8:15 pm.

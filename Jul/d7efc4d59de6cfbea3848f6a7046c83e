Dominic Akaraka, an Access Bank customer and trader in Ogbaru market, Onitsha, Anambra State, and over 1,000 customers across Nigeria emerged winners at the second quarterly draw of the DiamondXtra Season 12 reward scheme held in Lagos. Speaking shortly after receiving the Salary-4-Life cheque at his branch in Onitsha, 59-year-old Dominic expressed his excitement and told newsmen that he has been a customer of Access Bank for more than 10years, adding that Nigerians should partake in the initiative as it is real. He said, “I have been banking with Access Bank for more than 10 years now. The first time I got a call from the Bank that I won the star prize, I warned the person not to call me again and I hung up the phone thinking it was a fraudster but when they called again, I decided to give them a listening ear only to discover when I visited my branch that I have won the star prize of Salary-4-Life. “This means I would be paid N100,000 every month for 20 years. I am too excited and short of words. I am 59 years old with a wife and six children. Before I got this call from Access Bank, I and my family have been going through financial challenges and business has been very slow and unprofitable due to the lockdown and restriction of business activities within the state. “All my fellow traders are aware already and are opening the DiamondXtra account. I will encourage my friends and family members to bank with Access Bank so that they can partake in this initiative because it has salvaged my financial situation. I feel like I am still dreaming. Thank you Access Bank.” Head, Retail Product insight and Capabilities, Access Bank Plc, Rob Giles, noted that the bank has kept its promise of keeping the initiative going and growing. Giles revealed that over N5.4 billion in prize money has been doled out while adding that the Bank recently launched a variant of DiamondXtra tagged “Xtrawins” where customers are rewarded with daily, weekly and monthly cash rewards. He said, “We are trying to make the prizes more accessible so that more Nigerians can win every year, and the introduction of the XtraWins daily draws allows us to reward more customers frequently.

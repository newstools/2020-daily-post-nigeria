The recovery process of Kwara State’s patrimonies unlawfully taken away is still on course. This is according to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State. He said this at the swearing-in of members of the state Judicial Service Commission, and the State Assembly Service Commission in Ilorin on Tuesday. “For too long, our people have had their patrimonies taken away in the most brazen and fraudulent circumstances. “We have a historic duty to restore sanity and return to the people what belonged to them. “That recovery process, while long-drawn, has since begun in the most lawful manner,” the governor declared. He described the choice and appointment of the members as “a manifestation of what you have stood for over the years,” adding “you have distinguished yourselves as senior citizens with track records of integrity and selfless service to our people.” Governor Abdulrazaq reiterated his administration’s pursuit of a developmental agenda centred around the people. “We are determined to give our people a new lease of life, which could be made easier in an atmosphere of peace and tranquillity,” he added. Speaking on behalf of the JSC members, the chairman, Barrister Titus Olasupo Ashaolu, thanked the governor saying ” We promise to do our best, as members of the JSC will not disappoint you in the efforts to uplift the state and the progress of the judiciary.” Yusuf Abdulrasheed Oluwafemi, Chairman of the State House of Assembly Service Commission, on his part, also thanked the governor for “The confidence, trust, and the belief you have in our generation that, we can make things happen.”

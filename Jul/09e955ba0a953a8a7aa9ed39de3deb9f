Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State has said that he has no control over borders in the State as the federal government ordered the opening of borders in the Country. Ayade made this disclosure in a cocktail party organized for COVID-19 team members, members of the state executive council and other government functionaries in the state to mark the free status of Cross River COVID 19 He said the state no longer has control over its borders and has surrendered to the supremacy of the Federal Government and opened up borders. According to him, he would gain nothing by hiding cases of the virus in the state but noted that if anyone has the virus and pretend not to have it, then there will be mass death in the state. Ayade said he respected the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) who in spite of social media pressures from negative people were conscious that without a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, you could not say a test was positive, adding that it was why no case had been confirmed in Cross River. As a state, we were the first to shut down our borders, the record has it that Cross River is the only state that invested over 100 vehicles for effective manning of the borders and even went beyond securing the borders to the production of face masks, shields and other Personal Protective Equipment (PPEs) “So for some people to doubt the credibility of our COVID-19 free status is to imply that all the efforts of the state were not noticed. At this point, Cross River has been handed over to the Federal Government; all our borders are now open, following the lifting of the ban on inter-state movement by the Federal Government. “Cross River that is COVID-19 free will have an avalanche of cases, I see it coming, therefore, with this message, it means our response team will be back on the road because as long as our borders are open, our eyes will be open. “So, as a resident of the state, if you think by easing down, you are now safer, no, now you are more in danger, this is the time for you to commence a personal lockdown,” he said. Ayade, however, thanked the Federal Ministry of Health and NCDC for being a great example, playing a professional and technical role and giving a world-class response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.

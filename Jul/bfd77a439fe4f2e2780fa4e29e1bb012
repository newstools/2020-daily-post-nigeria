Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, wants to hire Leeds boss, Marcelo Bielsa, as their new manager, according to the UK Sun. Bielsa is Messi’s favoured candidate to replace the embattled Quique Setien. The 65-year-old has just guided Leeds back to the Premier League after winning the Championship title, but his contract at Elland Road expires this month. Setien is under increasing pressure at the Nou Camp, after Real Madrid snatched the LaLiga title from Barca this season. The Catalans were leading at the top of the league with two points before the COVID-19, but threw away their advantage after the restart. After a 2-1 loss to Osasuna at home this month, Messi branded Barca “weak” and “inconsistent”. The Argentine superstar also said performances since January – when Setien replaced Ernesto Valverde – had been very bad.

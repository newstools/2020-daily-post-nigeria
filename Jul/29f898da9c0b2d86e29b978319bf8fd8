The Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Abia State, Barrister Perfect Okorie, has expressed concern over the abandonment of federal roads project carried out by the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, in the state. The APC scribe also drew the attention of the federal government, to the inability of the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, to continue work on the abandoned Obehie-Obohia-Azumini-Ukanafun highway, which according to him, has become deathtraps to commuters and residents playing the major road. Okorie, who spoke through a press statement made available to newsmen, in Umuahia, Monday, stressed that the abandoned roads connected Abia oil-producing and agrarian communities with their counterparts in Akwa-Ibom and Rivers State. The APC Secretary further applauded the efforts of the Federal Ministry of Niger Delta and the Niger Delta Development Commission, (NDDC) and pleaded with them to commence work on the Aba-Opobo-Azumini highway. Okorie also frowned at the exclusion of the South East in the first and second (incumbent) NDDC Interim Management Committee, which has given APC serious concerns. The lawyer, therefore urged the Federal government to urgently look into this, as it stated that two Oil producing States in the southeast zone (Imo and Abia) did not have representatives in the team. His words, “These are roads that their current situation if improved can automatically change the economic fortunes of our businessmen and women and make interstate commercial activities between Abia and her neighbouring states much easier. We all know about the Onitsha-Enugu highway. The Second Niger Bridge is no longer news because that bridge is seriously under construction”.

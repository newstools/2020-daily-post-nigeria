The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila has directed the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio to publish the names of lawmakers taking contracts from the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) within 48 hours or risks the full wrath of the House. The Speaker directed the Clerk of the National Assembly to send a communication to the minister today. The directive followed the adoption of a point of privilege. He also declared that the Committee on NDDC can summon the ‘slumped’ Acting Managing Director of the NDDC, Keme Pondei if it wishes so. “I am giving the Minister 24-48 hours, to publish the names, the contracts, the companies, date, amount and the projects. I am directing the clerk to do so.
Failing which, this house will bring the full wrath of the house on him. It is important that we set this record straight. The Minister owes it to himself, to the committee, to people of Niger Delta, and the country to publish it. I will reserve my judgement. The minister came there to play games, but we do not play games here.”

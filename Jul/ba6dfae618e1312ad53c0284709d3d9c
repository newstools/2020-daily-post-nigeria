Lionel Messi looks more likely to leave Barcelona at the end of next season, after Xavi Hernandez signed a new deal with Al-Sadd, the UK Mirror reports. Messi is believed to be unhappy at the Nou Camp and is said to have ended discussions over a new contract. His current deal is set to expire next summer. Messi is frustrated over a lack of quality in the playing squad and being made a scapegoat for issues within the club. It was suggested the Argentine superstar would only reconsider, if his former teammate Xavi is appointed as Barca’s new manager. However, Xavi has agreed fresh terms with Al-Sadd, which will see him continue in the Qatari club into next season. “I am happy to continue with Al-Sadd, and the team’s goal will always be to compete for all titles. “(My) complete focus in this current period is to fully equip the players for the upcoming domestic and Asian competitions,” Xavi said.

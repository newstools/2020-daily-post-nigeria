Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers has named James Maddison, and Ricardo as the two key players the Foxes are missing following their 3-0 victory against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday. He also said that his team defeated Crystal Palace as a result of collective effort. Maddison and Ricardo did not feature against Palace at the King Power Stadium as goals from Kelechi Iheanacho (1), and Jamie Vardy (2) gave the host all three points against the visitors. “It was a real collective effort today. We have not been at our best, and even today we were missing key players in Maddison and Ricardo,” Rodgers said as quoted by Leicester Mercury after the game. “We changed the system to put more risk into it, and it worked well.” Leicester City are in the third position on the Premier League table with 55 points from 32 games. They will face Arsenal in their next fixture on Tuesday at the Emirates Stadium.

Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has blasted Marcos Alonso for “costing Chelsea the game” following their 3-2 defeat to West Ham on Wednesday night. The Blues had taken the lead through Willian’s penalty, before the hosts struck back twice to take the lead. Willian’s free-kick made it 2-2, but Andriy Yarmolenko’s late counter-attack goal earned the Hammers a big win in their battle to avoid the drop. Neville, speaking on Sky Sports afterwards, slammed Alonso for his role in West Ham’s winner, with the Spaniard failing to track Yarmolenko’s run from inside his own half. “Look at him, look at him, look at him. What are you doing, Marcos Alonso? What are you doing? That’s his running back speed. “It’s cost Chelsea the game, along with a poor piece of defending from [Antonio] Rudiger. “Marcos Alonso is level with [Andriy] Yarmolenko when the counter-attack starts and he doesn’t bother. “Run back as fast as you can when you lose the ball, you learn that at the age of six,” Neville said.

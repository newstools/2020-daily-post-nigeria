Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola on Thursday called on all security agencies in Nigeria to carry out drug tests. This, he explained, would ensure that only drug-free operatives bear arms. He made the call at the flag-off ceremony of substance abuse test tagged, “The test begins with me” by the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) in Abuja. The minister said the government could not afford to have officers work under the influence of drugs. Arebesola noted that an abuser of drugs can not be in full control of his or her senses. “He is capable of endangering the lives of the citizens besides the dangers that the abusers are already exposed to, by himself and for himself. “I, therefore, recommend this initiative to all security agencies in Nigeria, all Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and generally to the public.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has reacted to an allegation made by the All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship candidate in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu that it sold its candidacy to the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki for N15 billion. Ize-Iyamu had made the claim in a statement signed by John Mayaki, his Campaign Director of Communications. However, the Edo State PDP campaign council described the allegation as false. The Leader of the Publicity Committee of the council, High Chief Raymond Dokpesi, said it was unimaginable that Ize-Iyamu, who defected to the PDP in 2016 to contest for the position without giving anybody a dime, would be making such allegation. Dokpesi, while speaking in Port Harcourt, Rivers State over the weekend said: “I do not know from which of the resources we would have expected Obaseki to have drawn N15bn to give to who? “When Ize-Iyamu left APC did he give anybody a dime to come into PDP that he ran in the ticket in 2016? “There is no iota of truth in that allegation. It is a phantom charge and it is part of the known propaganda and lies that that party parades at all times. “To who did he give the money? Is it to the leaders, the governors, members of BoT? It is arrant nonsense and unacceptable allegation. “It is to incite the PDP followers in Edo State that their leaders had been settled and they didn’t get any portion of that”.

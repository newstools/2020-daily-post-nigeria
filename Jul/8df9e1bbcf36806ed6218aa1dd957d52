Alvaro Fernandez has confirmed he has left Real Madrid and signed a four-year contract with Manchester United. The 17-year-old left-back’s contract with the Spanish club expired on June 30, after he failed to agree fresh terms. This means he moves to United as a free agent. Fernandez joined Real Madrid from Deportivo La Coruña in 2017. “It hasn’t been an easy decision and I only have words of thanks,” he wrote on Instagram. “I’ve taken the decision to leave this great club. The time has come to say goodbye and take another path in my footballing career.” The defender played for Madrid’s Under-15s, U16s and U17s in his three seasons at Valdebebas, being known as an attacking full-back with an impressive physique and pace. He is expected to feature for United’s reserves next season, with the possibility of training with the first team when defensive reinforcements are required.

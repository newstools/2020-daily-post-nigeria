The 2019/2020 Premier League will come to an end on Sunday. For the first time, Arsenal will finish outside the top six places. Even if the Gunners defeat Watford at the Emirates in their last game, the best position they can finish is eighth place. However, their rivals Manchester United and Chelsea are locked in a battle to finish in the top four places and qualify for Champions League. United only need a draw at Leicester City on the final day to finish in the top four. Chelsea, who host Wolves at Stamford Bridge, also need just one more point to secure a top-four place. Going into todayâ€™s finale, United occupy the third place, while the Blues are in fourth place.

The suspended chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, has said he has not been summoned by the Presidential Committee on Audit of Recovered Assets (PCARA) for days. According to him, he last appeared before the panel one week ago. Magu’s counsel, Wahab Shittu, conveyed the concerns of his client in a letter submitted to the panel on Wednesday. According to Shittu, the suspended EFCC boss has not been brought before the panel between Thursday and Tuesday. He claimed that he arrived on the mentioned days and waited from 9am to 9pm, before being taken back into custody. He noted that the clarification became necessary after it was reported that Magu was questioned by the panel on Monday. “The allegation that our client was grilled by the Panel on Monday, 13th July, 2020, as reported above is complete falsehood,” the letter read. “The correct position was that our client and his Counsel (Mr. Wahab Shittu) arrived the venue of the ongoing Investigations on Monday 13th July, 2020 by 9am. Our client and his Counsel were kept at the waiting room of the venue of the sittings unattended from 9am to 9pm when our client was taken back to custody. “This followed the same pattern on Thursday and Friday last week when our client waited for 12 hours without being called upon by the Panel to partake in the proceedings. Witnesses called by the Panel were interrogated by the Panel without the participation of our client or his Counsel in the proceedings. This was also the pattern on Tuesday, 14th July, 2020. Our client chose to wait patiently on the panel.” Shittu also said Magu was yet to officially receive a copy of the allegations against him. He requested the panel to ask the Inspector-General of Police to release him from custody, to enable him to prepare properly for his defence. Magu also requested to be released so that he could attend to his health.

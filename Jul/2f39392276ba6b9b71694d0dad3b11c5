Some hoodlums suspected to be loyal to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Bauchi State today stormed the secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Bauchi to disrupt a press conference being addressed by some factional members of the party. The hoodlums stormed the Press Centre while the press conference was on as the factional members called for the dissolution of the state executive council of the party and disrupted the briefing. In their attempt to stop the briefing, the hoodlums hurled stones and chairs at journalists and other attendants, as two journalists sustained injuries in the attack. The arrival of a team of policemen led by the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the state, DSP Ahmed Wakili, restored order. DAILY POST reports that some of the hoodlums fled the Press Centre upon sighting policemen to avoid being arrested. Some others were, however, arrested by the policemen and taken to the headquarters of Zone 12 of the Nigeria Police Force in Bauchi where the case is being handled. The two journalists who were injured in the ensuing melee were accompanied to the Zone 12 by the state NUJ chairman, Umar Saâ€™id to give their statements. As of the time of filing this report, peace has been restored at the NUJ Press Centre

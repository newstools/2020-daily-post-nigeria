A chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Abiodun Oyefusi, has hailed the appointment of Rivers Governor, Nyesom Wike, as the Head of PDP Campaign Council for Edo election. She stated that the party’s choice was commendable and would ensure Governor Godwin Obaseki is re-elected, NAN reports. Oyefusi, on Saturday, expressed confidence that Wike would deliver Edo State to the PDP. The stalwart also commented on the newly constituted Caretaker Committee for the southwest zone. The National Working Committee (NWC) had on Thursday dissolved the Eddy Olafeso-led committee. The new one headed by Dayo Ogungbenro will be in charge for three months. Members are Daisi Akinniran (Secretary), Taiwo Kuye, Adeola Ogunrinde, Oyebola Awolowo, Nekan Olagbegi, Funmi Oguns, and Wahab Owokoniran. Oyefusi, PDP candidate for Lagos East District in 2019, charged the team to reposition the party. She urged them to discharge their duties “transparently and fairly and work assiduously to deliver the South West to the party by the next general elections”. Oyefusi commended Olafeso for producing a governor for PDP in Oyo and a number of federal and state lawmakers in the last general election.

Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Edo State, has berated the state governor, Godwin Obaseki over a video of the Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje on a digital billboard in the state. Ize-Iyamu said it was irresponsible and indecorous for Obaseki to use state resources to display such video placed at Ring Road in Benin City, Edo State Capital. The APC governorship candidate stressed that it was hypocritical for Obaseki to embark on such cheap blackmail when he was yet to account for his Commissioner for Arts, Culture and Diaspora Affairs, Osazee Osemwengie Ero, who remains in detention abroad after his arrest last year in France over credible allegations of money laundering. He stated this in a statement signed and sent to DAILY POST by John Mayaki, his Director of Communication and Media of his Campaign Organization. He said: “It is obvious to everyone in Edo State and beyond now that the outgoing Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, and his party of tax-collectors have no record or achievements to campaign with. “Otherwise, instead of wasting public funds on a lazy, indecorous, and irresponsible attempt to smear the reputation of Governor Umar Ganduje of Kano State, they would have seized the fraudulently obtained opportunity of a digital billboard at the heart of the state’s capital to show the people of Edo State consequential matters like their achievements in office.” “It is nothing but hypocrisy and a lack of awareness, two traits that contributed to the failure of the Obaseki-administration, for the Governor to sanction such an irresponsible move when his own Commissioner and best friend, Osazee Osemwingie Ero is still languishing in detention abroad since his arrest in France last year over credible allegations of money laundering.” “Obaseki is yet to tell Edo people the assignment Osazee Osemwingie Ero was carrying out for him in France before he was nabbed by the International Police with a reported sum of two million dollars.”

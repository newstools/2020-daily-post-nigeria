The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday alleged a plot by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to rig the upcoming governorship election in Edo State. PDP claimed the APC was plotting to use fabrications in a section of the media to arm-twist the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to manipulate the election in their favour. The party’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan alleged that APC was “planning to sponsor fake reports that PDP leaders were pressurizing INEC Chairman, Prof. Yakubu Mahmood on the Edo election.” Ologbondiyan said by making such a plot, the “APC has further exposed its hopelessness over their rejection by the Edo people and now seeks to blackmail the Commission. INEC has scheduled the governorship election in Edo State for September 19, 2020.

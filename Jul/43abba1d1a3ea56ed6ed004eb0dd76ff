The All Progressives Congress (APC) has expressed regret at the political development in Ondo State. On June 21, Governor Rotimi Akeredolu’s deputy, Agboola Ajayi, dumped the APC for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). On July 6, the Secretary to the State Government, Ifedayo Abegunde, resigned. On Tuesday, Akpan Udoedehe, National Secretary of APC Caretaker Committee, admitted that the situation was due to the crisis in the party. He spoke at the inauguration of the screening and appeal committees for the Ondo election. But in his remarks, the scribe referred to Ajayi as “former deputy governor”. Udoedehe said: “In the last few months, our party has been rocked by crisis in several states, including Ondo State, where the former Deputy Governor and the former Secretary to the State Government defected to other parties to seek platforms to contest for the governorship election”. He noted that that personal ambition “often leads people to act unreasonably, and in a manner skewed towards personal, rather than collective interest, as in this case”. Udoedehe said APC should not be swayed from its avowed course, noting that because the party was founded on the principles of fairness and natural justice. The former Senator assured that all aspirants would be subjected to the same fair, credible and transparent standards in the nomination process. He added that the APC had provided a platform for those who are not satisfied with the screening, to appeal the outcome of the exercise. “Your actions could either make or mar the party’s image. I urge you to proceed in the strength of your mandate, and do your best, bearing in mind that the reward for satisfactory performance is promotion”, Udoedehe added.

The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has activated additional police formations to step up security in Abuja. FCT Minister, Muhammad Bello, disclosed this when the six Area Council Chairmen visited him on Friday. He urged them to support the efforts of the security men posted to their areas. Bello stressed the need for the chairmen to only engage those who are suitably qualified. He enjoined them to focus on human capital development and always observe the principles of leadership and responsibility to their people. The minister advised the officials to focus on three main components of primary education, environmental sanitation and public health. “All of us will finish our tenures and we will still live within the communities. This is the time to upgrade your communities and focus on human capital development. “Making major changes in the communities do not necessarily require massive funding. What is required is massive re-orientation and mobilization of the people,” Bello added.

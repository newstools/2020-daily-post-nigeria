Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, says he is confident of winning trophies at the club before his three-year deal expires. Mourinho arrived in November after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked, but Spurs have already been knocked out of the Champions League and FA Cup during his time. Spurs find themselves in ninth position in the Premier League table ahead of Sunday’s North London Deby, but Mourinho said he needs time before he can succeed at the club. “How long it took for Jurgen [Klopp] and Liverpool?” Mourinho said. “Four years, four seasons. “Buying one of the best goalkeepers in the world, buying one of the best centre-backs in the world and so on and so on and so on. “I’m focused on my three-year contract. I believe that in my three-year contract we can win trophies. If we don’t, but the club does it in the new era if I stay here only for three years, I will be happy with that,” Mourinho said.

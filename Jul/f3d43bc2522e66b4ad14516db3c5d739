The World Health Organization (WHO) has reacted to the claim by a Cameroonian medical doctor, Kameni Pierre, that he was healed of COVID-19 by Nigeria’s Prophet, TB Joshua. Dr. Pierre had claimed that he was healed via Prophet Joshua’s church channel, Emmanuel Television. During WHO’s daily press briefing on COVID-19, its Director-General, Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus; Executive Director of Health Emergencies, Dr Michael Ryan and other officials of the health body were asked about the said miracle by Simon Ateba, a Cameroonian journalist. Dr Pierre, a gynecologist and obstetrician, in the video shared on Emmanuel TV and other social media channels of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, said he was suffering from the dreaded coronavirus and was in isolation in a hospital ward when he called in via a video to receive prayer from T.B Joshua during an interactive programme. The doctor went ahead to show his coronavirus positive medical report and while receiving prayer from Joshua, he allegedly ‘vomited’ the disease. After some days, Dr. Pierre showed another medical report which claims he is now negative. Ateba asked, “On Monday, a very popular pastor in Nigeria, T.B Joshua, released a video of a medical doctor in Cameroon who was said to have been cured of the virus through prayer?” Responding, Dr Ryan said. “Certainly, spiritual leadership is very important in a time like this.” Dr. Ghebreyesus added that faith and science should“go together. “We know many religious leaders who would really advise their followers to follow their faith and at the same time use science. “The two do not contradict; they go together. We will call on all religious leaders to be in this fight and save lives.”

Speaking to State House Correspondents after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday, Jonathan said he had written the President in appreciation for the gesture. Buhari recently named the largest station on the Warri-Itakpe railway route –the Agbor railway facility and station – after Jonathan. “Let me use this opportunity to commend Mr. President publicly,” he said, adding that he had already sent a letter to the President privately to thank him for the gesture. “And completing the railway programme is good. It shows that the President is doing, is going on with the legacy projects of the previous administrations. That is the way to go. “I sent a letter to him. I commended him verbally too but you are asking me now. Let me also do it publicly. I appreciate it, I thank Mr. President, the Minister of Transportation, and others that made it possible,” he said. Earlier, the former had said he maintains a good relationship with his successor, President Buhari. Asked about their current relationship, he said: “You’ve been seeing me coming and you have been seeing us having friendly conversations. “So, our relationship is ok.”

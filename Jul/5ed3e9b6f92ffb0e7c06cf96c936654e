Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has revealed he held a dressing room inquest with his players, following their defeat at Sheffield United last Thursday. Mourinho admitted he was left “destroyed a little bit on the inside” after the game at Bramall Lane, which hit their chances of qualifying for European football. Tottenham is in 10th place ahead of Monday’s clash against Everton and needs a result to salvage their season. And in a desperate bid to revive the club’s ailing fortunes, Mourinho says he held a meeting between the players and the coaching staff. “What happens inside stays inside – I think that’s a golden rule – but it was a very honest meeting. “It wasn’t a monologue, it was dialogue because the players also had the chance to speak with me, and we shared views, and we shared emotions, and we shared analysis,” Mourinho said.

Inter Milan midfielder, Christian Eriksen is among eleven (11) players the club reportedly want to sell this summer’s transfer window. According to MediaSet, Eriksen could already be leaving the club, with Inter Milan willing to listen to offers of more than £55milion for the playmaker. Eriksen only moved to the San Siro in the January transfer window but has been dropped from the starting line-up recently after showing poor form. The Denmark international signed from Tottenham Hotspur for a cut-price fee of £20million but has struggled with his new club and playing in Italy. He has scored only one goal and provided two assists from his five starts and six substitute appearances in Serie A for Inter. Inter Milan coach, Antonio Conte is keen to bolster his squad ahead of next season. Conte confirmed recently that the Eriksen had been dropped because of poor performances and urged the former Ajax star not to rely on his reputation to get him into his team. He said: “He [Erisken] has to hold down certain levels, but balance is needed. “He is improving, and he’s aware that he joined an ambitious club that is asking a lot of him. “Expectations are high in Italy. The bigger the name you are, the more people expect from you. “He is committed and doing well, but I have to make decisions for the good of Inter.”

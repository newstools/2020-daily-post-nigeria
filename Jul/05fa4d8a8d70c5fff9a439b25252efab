Kwara State government on Tuesday, suspended five senior officials including a Permanent Secretary, Bayo Audu Onimago, indicted in the ongoing probe of ghost workers and financial infractions at the State Universal Basic Education Board, in Ilorin. The four others are the Director of Finance and Supply, Hussein Ahmed, Account officers, Mujeeb Ibrahim, and Oyerinde Fatai, and a staff of the state Teaching Service Commission who doubled as the state chairman of the Nigeria Union of Teachers, NUT, Toyin Salihu. Toyin Salihu had earlier been suspended indefinitely by that national leadership of the NUT. The state Commissioner for Communication, Murtala Olanrewaju, who broke the news in a statement in Ilorin, Tuesday, said, “the indefinite suspension is connected to some discoveries of alleged fraud in the parastatal by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. “This is in line with the efforts of Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq’s administration to cleanse the system, particularly at SUBEB where some startling discoveries have been made. “Salaries and accounts connected to the controversial names on the payroll have been flagged and suspended until the end of the exercise,” the commissioner added. DAILY POST reports that the national leadership of the NUT, had last week suspended state chairman, the secretary, Idris Jamiu Ola and Comrade Tijani Lateef for their alleged questionable role in the financial scam busted by the Ilorin zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, describing it as “ignominious act”. The suspended NUT Chairman had revealed how they shared over N30m meant for salaries of about 400 teachers on the payroll of SUBEB.

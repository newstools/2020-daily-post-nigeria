Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil’s agent, Erkut Sogut, has provided the latest update on his client’s future at Emirates. Sogut insisted that there is a “90 per cent” chance Ozil will leave Arsenal when his contract expires in 2021, adding that he may join a club in the USA or Turkey. Ozil, who is Arsenal’s top earner on £350,000-a-week, has failed to make a single first-team appearance since the Premier League’s restart. The ex-Germany international does not appear to be in Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta’s plans for next season. “I do not think there will be a change in the case of Mesut Ozil until the summer of 2021,” Sogut told Turkish newspaper, Fanatik. “He has a contract. There is no change. He will remain with Arsenal.” He added: “There’s a 90 per cent chance he will leave Arsenal in 2021. “Mesut to Asia, America or Turkey? Yes, maybe.” Meanwhile, Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, had claimed last week that Ozil’s Arsenal career was over whether or not he leaves the club this summer.

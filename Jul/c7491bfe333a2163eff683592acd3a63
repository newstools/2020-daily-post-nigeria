The House of Representatives has begun investigations into the alleged illegal removal of managements of three federal agencies by President Muhammadu Buhari. They are Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading (NBET), Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) and Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). Buhari’s action followed recommendations by the Minister of Labour, Chris Ngige and the Minister of Power, Sale Mamman. Ngige sanctioned the NSITF management and has inaugurated a panel to probe the ousted officials. Mamman sanctioned TCN ex-Managing Director, Usman Gur Mohammed, while Sule Abdulaziz was named the acting MD. The investigation is chaired by Rep. Miriam Onuoha (APC – Imo). The lawmaker recalled that last Friday, the House resolved to investigate the alleged breach of procurement procedures and financial malpractice and malfeasance in the agencies. Onuoha said the committee reached out to all concerned with a call for memoranda. She confirmed that about 95 per cent of all actors involved have made written submissions. “This committee wishes to extend to all the parties the benefit of the principle of fair hearing. I wish to remind us that this committee is not out to witch-hunt anybody, but play our legislative duties; please note that we will be just and fair to all concerned in this matter,” she said. Hearing on the matter continues this week. All parties, including Nigige and Mamman, are expected to speak on documents already presented to the committee.

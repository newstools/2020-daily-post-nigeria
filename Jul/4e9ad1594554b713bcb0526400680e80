Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, wants Paul Pogba to sign a new deal with the club. Pogba has long been linked with a transfer to Real Madrid or former team, Juventus. He admitted last year that he was looking for a “new challenge”. The France midfielder made just eight appearances in all competitions during an injury-hit season before the COVID-19 lockdown. However, the 26-year-old has impressed since the restart. Having recently signed Nemanja Matic and Scott McTominay to new deals, Solskjaer is optimistic the club can also secure the long-term future of Pogba, whose current contract is due to expire next year, although United have the option of triggering a one-year extension. “I can’t comment on discussions between players and the club but of course we want to keep the best players. “We want to build a squad for the future and Scott and Nemanja, they’re in similar positions but in different stages of their careers – one at the start and one really experienced one. “We also need players in that mid-range group so hopefully we can do something. I know that since Paul came back from injury he’s looking better and better. He’s just enjoying his football and let’s see where it takes us,” Solskjaer told Sky Sports.

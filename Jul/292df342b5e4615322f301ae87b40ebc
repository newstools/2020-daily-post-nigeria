Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, is ready to sell Matteo Guendouzi, Lucas Torreira, and Sead Kolasinac before next season, according to the UK Times. Arteta is preparing for his first summer transfer market as Gunners’ boss but might be limited to loans and free transfers unless he can raise funds via sales. Arsenal’s transfer kitty will be boosted if they qualify for either the Champions League or Europa League. Henrikh Mkhitaryan has already joined Roma on a permanent deal and Mesut Ozil continues to be linked with a move away. But Arteta wants to reshuffle his squad further and is looking to offload left-back Kolasinac and some of the seven center-backs at the club, along with Guendouzi and Torreira. Kolasinac has endured a mixed spell in north London since his move from Schalke in 2017 and neither Guendouzi nor Torreira have convinced Arteta that they have long-term futures at Arsenal.

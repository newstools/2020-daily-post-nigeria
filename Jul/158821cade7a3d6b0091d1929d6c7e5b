The Nigeria Police has charged one Moses Anyaoha with nine counts bordering on criminal conspiracy, culpable homicide and stealing. Anyaoha and one Tony Mba, now at large, between 2010 and January 2011, conspired to commit offence of culpable homicide contrary to Section 96 of the Penal Code. Peter Amadi, the prosecution counsel, said the defendant injected DCP Augustina Ihesiaba with poison. The act, which caused her death, was contrary to Section 221 of the Penal Code. Anyaoha also allegedly stole N70million from the various accounts of the deceased, contrary to Section 287 of the Penal Code. Furthermore, the defendant allegedly sold plots of land in Abuja entrusted to him by the deceased contrary to Section 312 of the Penal Code. Anyaoha pleaded not guilty when the charges were read to him. His lawyer, Raeboh Sanami, could not argue his bail as he failed to serve the prosecution with the motion. Justice Peter Kekemeke ordered that Anyaoha be remanded at the Police facility at Garki in Abuja. He adjourned until September 17 for the hearing of the defendantâ€™s bail application.

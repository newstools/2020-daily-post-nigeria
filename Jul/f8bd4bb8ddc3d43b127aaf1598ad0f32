Thousands of former militants from Edo State have commended the empowerment plans outlined in the manifesto of the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and promised to support him in the Sept. 19 governorship election in the State. They made this promise on Thursday in a meeting with the candidate in Benin City where they were led by a former militant Chief, General Don Ben. Speaking on behalf of the group, General Don Ben said the empowerment plans outlined in the SIMPLE agenda manifesto of Ize-Iyamu are reflective of their desires and if implemented, will engender peace and proper social integration across communities in Edo State. He berated the incumbent Governor Godwin Obaseki for failing to fulfil his promises to the people, especially the Ijaws living in the creeks. The militant leader Obaseki-led government of neglecting his people, a ‘wicked’ development which he claims motivated them to commence community awareness advocacy to canvass votes for Osagie Ize-Iyamu following a careful study of his manifesto and affirmation of his noble intentions and previous records of achievement. In response, Ize-Iyamu thanked the group for their support and especially commended Don Ben for providing effective representation for his people. He assured them of his readiness to roll back the poor policies of the ‘insensitive’ Obaseki-administration and replace them with people-focused policies and schemes targeted at empowering the youths and creating gainful opportunities for positive and economically rewarding engagements.

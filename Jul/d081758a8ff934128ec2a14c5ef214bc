Barcelona have failed with a bid to appoint former Tottenham Hotspur manager, Mauricio Pochettino, as their new manager, The Times reports. Barcelona have considered Pochettino as a replacement for current manager, Quique Setien, after failing to win the 2019/20 LaLiga title ahead of Real Madrid. However, Pochettino has rejected the approach because he was a former player and coach of Barcelona derby rivals, Espanyol. The Argentine will not consider working for Barcelona out of loyalty for Espanyol. DAILY POST recalls that Pochettino had some days ago turned down an offer to become Monacoâ€™s new manager. Pochettino remains desperate to secure an imminent return to the English Premier League. He has also attracted interest from Juventus and Newcastle United respectively. Pochettino is waiting for the right opportunity to return to club management after he was sacked by Tottenham last November.

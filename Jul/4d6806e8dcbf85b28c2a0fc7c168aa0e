The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) has told Nigerians to be wary of recruitment notice. Head of Public Affairs, Paul Osu, gave the warning on Monday. He told citizens not to part with huge sums of money for employment into the agency. Osu noted that scammers were masquerading as recruitment agencies and issuing bogus ‘DPR recruitment forms 2020/2021’ with spurious claims and promises of job offers. DPR said it was currently not conducting any recruitment exercise and had not engaged any persons, agents or consultants to act as intermediaries. The agency reiterated that employment is carried out in accordance with extant rules guiding such exercises in the Nigerian Public service in line with due process philosophy of government. DPR explained that recruitment notices were usually published in national newspapers and its official website. The statement declared that any one who goes against the advisory was at their own risk.

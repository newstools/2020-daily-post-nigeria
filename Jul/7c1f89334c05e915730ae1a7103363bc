Manchester United could be without injured defenders, Luke Shaw and Eric Bailly, for their final Premier League fixture of the season against Leicester City on Sunday. Shaw has not played since twisting his ankle against Southampton earlier this month and missed the last three games. Bailly suffered a concussion during last weekend’s FA Cup semi-final defeat to Chelsea. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, says he will give the duo as much time as possible to prove their fitness. “We’re going to give them as much time as possible,’ Solskjaer told MUTV. “I’m not going to rule anything out.” The Red Devils need just a point from the game to ensure Champions League qualification.

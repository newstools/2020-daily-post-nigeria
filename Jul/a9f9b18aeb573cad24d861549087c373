Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has said the club cannot sell its best players to raise transfer funds this summer. The Gunners have been linked with a number of players recently, mostly Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey. While the Premier League club smashed their transfer record to land Nicolas Pepe from Lille last summer, the £72million deal was structured over a period of time. It has now been suggested in certain quarters that Arteta would need to offload some senior players to raise money, especially with qualification for European football looking unlikely. When asked if the club would have to sell to bring in new players, Arteta told reporters on Friday: “We have seen different things. The way that Chelsea is dealing with the market is different to rest at the moment, but Bayern Munich as well they’ve been really aggressive. “So I don’t know. But if you ask me, we cannot be a team that has to sell his best player to try to bring in and improve our squad. That’s for sure.”

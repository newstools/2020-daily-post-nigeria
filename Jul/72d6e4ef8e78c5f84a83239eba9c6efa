A former Liverpool player, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted some of Sunday’s Premier League final day fixtures. Leicester City will host Manchester United at the King Power Stadium, while Tottenham Hotspur will face Crystal Palace. Chelsea will tackle Wolves at Stamford Bridge following a 5-3 defeat to Liverpool in their last game. Providing his prediction, Lawrenson told BBC Sport: “United don’t need a win to make the top four, but I think they will get one – they are definitely playing Leicester at the right time.” On the Chelsea vs Wolves game, Lawrenson said: “Chelsea need a point to be sure of making the Champions League, while Wolves can guarantee a sixth place and qualification for the Europa League if they win. “It’s Chelsea I fancy here – I don’t see Leicester getting anything out of Manchester United anyway, but Frank Lampard’s side will take care of their own business.” Commenting on the Tottenham vs Palace match, Lawrenson said: “It seems a very long time ago that Crystal Palace marked their return to Premier League action in June by beating Bournemouth to move level with Tottenham in the table. “At that stage, both teams had 40 points from 30 games – but they have gone in opposite directions in the past few weeks. “The Eagles have lost all seven of their matches since then, while Spurs are finishing their season strongly and Harry Kane is scoring goals again. I’m expecting more of the same here.” The match kick-off time for all the fixtures is at 4 pm.

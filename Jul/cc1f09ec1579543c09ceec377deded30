The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami, has said that the probe of suspended acting chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu, is a “plus” for President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Malami stated this while speaking on NTA’s ‘One-on-One’ programme hosted by Cyril Stober. According to him, the fact that Magu is being investigated, proves no one is above the law. When asked if the probe was not a blow to Buhari’s anti-corruption war, Malami insisted it reinforces the fact that this administration is committed to the fight against corruption without fear or favour. “It goes on to establish the tradition which this government is known for; a tradition of no fear or favour as far as investigating corruption cases or allegations are concerned. “So, to my mind, it is indeed a plus that reinforces and re-establishes a tradition by which the government of President Muhammadu Buhari is known, re-established to the effect that no allegation of corruption can be swept under the carpet. So, it is indeed a plus and not a blow,” Malami said. Magu’s ordeal began after a memo by Malami accused him of mishandling recovered loot.

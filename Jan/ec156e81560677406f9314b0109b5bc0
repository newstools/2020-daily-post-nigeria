He said the National Chairman should resign instead of calling for prayers he does not need. Idahosa said, “Comrade Oshiomhole should spare us the drama of asking Nigerians to pray for him over the APC crisis. “It is just a case of barefaced deceit, which is second nature to him. It is public knowledge that he is the cause of the crisis in the party, at the national and state levels. “At the national level, the state governors are inching very close to removing him on account of his high-handedness, sabotage and tyrannical approach to running the party. “The APC is in more crisis than Oshiomhole met it; the party has lost grounds on account of the national chairman’s combative stance in running its affairs.”

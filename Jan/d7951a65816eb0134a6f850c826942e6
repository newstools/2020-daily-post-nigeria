Manchester United have been charged by the Football Association with failing to control their players, during their 2-0 defeat to Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. United goalkeeper, David de Gea, reacted angrily to a challenge from Virgil van Dijk before VAR intervened. Van Dijk competed for the ball with De Gea, backing into the Spaniard as he sought to keep the play alive. Firmino scored from the passage of play, but it was ruled out eventually. However, not after some United players confronted referee Craig Pawson angrily. Certain members of the United team then lost their cool, with De Gea leading the way. English football’s governing body has said in a statement on Tuesday: “Manchester United FC has been charged with a breach of FA Rule E20(a). “It is alleged that the club failed to ensure its players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion during the 26th minute of the Premier League fixture against Liverpool FC on Sunday (19/1/20). Manchester United FC has until Thursday (23/1/20) to provide a response.”

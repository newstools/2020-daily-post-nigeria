Russia has reacted to Iran’s admission that its military actually shot down the Kiev-bound Ukrainian international airliner on Wednesday. The plane crash which killed all 176 passengers and crew members happened near Tehran, the Iranian capital. Iran admitted on Saturday that it accidentally shot down the plane. But before then, Russian legislators had warned US and other nations to stop making “groundless” claims on how the plane crashed. Reacting to the Iranian admission on Saturday the chairman of the Russian parliament’s foreign affairs committee Konstantin Kosachev told Interfax, “If decryption of the black boxes and the work of the investigation do not prove that the Iranian army did this intentionally, and there are no logical reasons for this, the incident must be closed. “Hoping that lessons will be learned and action taken by all parties.”

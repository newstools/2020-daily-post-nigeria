Former Arsenal midfielder, Ray Parlour has urged the club’s manager, Mikel Arteta to sign 25-year-old Manchester City star, John Stones. According to Parlour, Stones would make an ideal centre-back partner for Sokratis. DAILY POST had reported that Stones has been linked with a move to Arsenal this month, “I’d be very very happy if they brought someone like John Stones to the club,” Parlour told talkSPORT. “He would definitely play. With Calum Chambers out and Rob Holding in the background, if one of Luiz or Sokratis get injured Arsenal haven’t got a lot of back-up at centre half. “Would Luiz and Stones work together? Well, they’ve got Sokratis. Stones could play alongside him. He’s the better defender. Stones” He added: “Luiz has done alright in recent weeks. He’s done better. He does make a mistake, and we’ve see that this season, but I think he’s done well. “I think, if you’re really struggling in midfield, you could play Luiz as a holding midfielder. He can play there because he’s got that range of passing and he’s very good on the ball, he is technically very good. “So they could play Stones and Sokratis at the back with Luiz in front of them, that could work.”

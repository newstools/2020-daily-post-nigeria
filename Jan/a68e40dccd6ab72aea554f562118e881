Arsenal striker, Alexandre Lacazette, has criticized his team mates for being “naive”, following a 1-1 draw with Sheffield United. The Gunners looked on course to beat the Blades on Saturday, but conceded late to share points. John Fleck’s deflected shot in the 83rd minute, cancelled out Gabriel Martinelli’s effort before half time. Arsenal have led against Crystal Palace (twice), Chelsea, Eintracht Frankfurt, Vitoria, Wolves and Watford this season, only to fail to take three points. And Lacazette has slammed the Gunners for their poor mentality. “They were not very dangerous but this match summarises how we are this season. We are winning the match but don’t get it over the line,” Lacazette told RMC Sport. “We are quite naive at the moment. We need to be nastier and more consistent in the 90th to 93rd minutes of matches. “Especially when we can do better than this. We have the players required. It is a shame.”

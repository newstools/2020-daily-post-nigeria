Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp has hailed Wolves winger, Adama Traore after the 23-year-old’s impressive display in the Reds’ Premier League 2-1 win over ‎Nuno Espírito Santo’s side on Thursday night. Goals from Jordan Henderson and Roberto Firmino gave the Reds all three points against the hosts at Molineux as Raul Jimenez’s strike was not enough to salvage a point for Wolves. Speaking on Traore’s performance after the match, Klopp was quoted by Metro UK as at his post-match conference: “Traore is unplayable in moments, it’s unbelievable. “What a player – it’s not only him but he’s so good.” Also speaking, Liverpool captain, Jordan Henderson said the Spain Under-21 international was difficult to play against. Henderson added: “Traore is very tough, strong, powerful, and quick. “He’s difficult to play against. But the lads did brilliantly against him.” The win over Wolves means Liverpool are now 16 points ahead of second place, Manchester City on the Premier League table with a game at hand.

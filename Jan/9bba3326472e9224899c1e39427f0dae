Former Manchester United defender, Patrice Evra has revealed that Liverpool have apologised to him for wearing t-shirts in support of Luis Suarez after the Uruguayan racially abused him in 2011. Suarez, now Barcelona star, was banned for eight matches nine years ago and a day after the ban, Liverpool wore ‘Suarez 7’ t-shirts in the warm-up before facing Wigan. The matter has lingered with Evra earlier admitting that Liverpool’s action had left him feeling frustrated to say the least. The Frenchman has now revealed that Liverpool CEO Peter Moore has been in touch via a letter apologising for the incident. Speaking as a pundit on Sunday ahead of the Premier League clash between Manchester United and Liverpool Evra made the revelation. “Yes, first of all, I was really pleased when Jamie Carragher apologised, of course, I received a personal letter from Peter Moore and I was really touched by it,” Evra told Sky Sports. “He told me he hopes he was never too late as this incident was nine years ago but I thought it was really positive. “After like three days after the show (they got in contact), I was like ‘thank you very much, this letter has really touched my heart’. “I was very disappointed for such a big club as Liverpool to support a big cause like that but now I can see real people, honest people working for this club and I even get more respect for Liverpool because they are fighting for a problem about the human race. “I was really pleased. I just said I hope you’re not going to win the league but that was three months ago. It was really important for me and as I say, we have a big rivalry between us but this shows you Liverpool are a top-class club.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has made it clear he will not sign short-term fixes, just to protect his job. Solskjaer is dealing with an injury crisis, with seven players out, including first-choice centre midfield duo, Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay. Former United skipper, Gary Neville, claimed that the Norwegian needs to sign players this month to safeguard his position, with his job under threat. But Solskjaer, speaking ahead of Norwich’s visit, said: “No, not at all. I’m not going to protect myself. I’m going to do what’s best for the club, what I think and we feel is right for the club and I will never put myself before the club. “For me there’s no ‘I’ in this team and I could never, ever do that, that’s not me. I’m working for Manchester United, not for me. “It wouldn’t always be the worst thing you can do, to put a short-term fix in if it’s good for the group. “But you wouldn’t put yourself in a situation where you’ve done something that you regret in 18 months’ time. “We’ve got to do due diligence – character of players, quality of players, that are the right fit into this squad.”

Manchester United have scrapped plans for a training camp in the Middle East for the sake of players’ safety. United have a break between their home game against Wolves on February 1 and the trip to Chelsea on February 17. And the club had looked into the prospect of organising a warm weather camp in either Qatar or Dubai during that time. But tensions caused by the brewing conflict between the United States and Iran, have prompted United into a rethink. “We were looking at Middle East but that is definitely not going to happen,” manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer told a news conference on Tuesday. “If there is one thing that worries me, it’s not on the football pitch, there are other things that will worry me more than football.”

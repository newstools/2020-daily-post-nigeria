The Presidency has insisted that no law in Nigeria mandates President Muhammadu Buhari to declare his assets publicly. Buhari’s spokesperson, Femi Adesina made the remark while stressing that the Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has no legal justification to ask the President and his Vice, as well as state governors and their deputies to declare their assets publicly. SERAP had given Buhari, Osinbajo, state governors and their deputies a 7-day ultimatum to make their assets public. Featuring on Channels Television programme, Politics Today, last night, Adesina said: “I can say for a fact that he (Buhari) has declared his assets because I am privy to it. And SERAP asking the president to declare publicly and I ask: On the basis of which law? “The president would do what the law requires of him, and what the law requires is, he should declare his assets which he has done. “Declaring publicly is not in our laws. It can only be a voluntary thing. So, if anybody is compelling somebody to declare publicly, I don’t know, on the basis of what law? “If the FOI Act is invoked, it would be left with the Code of Conduct Bureau to release because the FOI Act will not be for the president. “The president has declared and it is already deposited with the CCB. So, it is the CCB to respond to the FOI Act if it is invoked.”

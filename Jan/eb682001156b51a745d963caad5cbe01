Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, on Tuesday sent Victor Lindelof home from training, the Manchester Evening News reports. It is believed that the move is a precaution, as the defender was feeling unwell. Lindelof played the entire 90 minutes, as United lost 2-0 to Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. Solskjaer will be hoping to have him fit for Wednesdayâ€™s game against Burnley at home. The Red Devils are currently fifth in the league. They sit five points off fourth-placed Chelsea and a massive 30 points off leaders Liverpool.

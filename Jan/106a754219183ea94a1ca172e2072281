Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has provided the latest update on striker, Marcus Rashford and defender, Harry Maguire ahead of his side’s Premier League clash with Liverpool on Sunday evening. Solskjaer said he will give Rashford and Maguire time before deciding whether they will be fit to face Jurgen Klopp’s side at Anfield. Rashford sustained a back injury during Man United’s FA Cup 1-0 victory over Wolves some few days ago, while Maguire is yet to regain full fitness after recovering from injury. Asked if he will play Rashford in Sunday’s clash, Solskjaer was quoted by Man United’s official website as telling reporters on Friday at his pre-match press conference: “I can’t tell you now. “As I said with Harry [Maguire] a few weeks ago, of course we’re going to give him the absolute amount of time to find out. “We’re going to do some more checks and treatment with him today. Yesterday of course was just a recovery day anyway and some treatment for him. “I haven’t seen him this morning, but I’m not going to hold my breath. I would probably think that he wouldn’t be ready, but let’s see. There’s still 48 hours, more than that, so let’s see.” The kick-off time for the match 5:30pm.

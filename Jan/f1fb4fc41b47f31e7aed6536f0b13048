The Akwa Ibom State Commissioner of Police, CP Imohimi Edgal, has called on the State House of Assembly to reconsider as well as pass into law the ‘Vigilante Bill’ as soon as it resumes plenary on January 21, 2020. The Commissioner noted that passing the vigilante bill into law in the state was important as it would give the group a legal framework in combating crimes and criminality in the communities. CP Edgal, who was the special guest of honour at the ‘community and safety partnership interactive session’ held at itu local government area of the state on Thursday, said the vigilante groups would help in beefing security in the grassroots. The commissioner also emphasized on the importance of community policing, stressing that it was more effective to engage the people in fighting crimes than using guns and lethal weapons and encouraged paramount rulers, the civil society organisations and other critical stakeholders to encourage able bodied young men to volunteer and form vigilante groups. His words, “I am here in Itu, to find out your peculiar security challenge. Every area has its specific security challenge. It could be robbery, stealing, rape, defilement or assault. Gone are the days we tackle community crimes with guns and lethal weapons, now we want to solve these problems by engaging the people. “I urge the state House of Assembly to continue with the vigilante bill when they resume plenary. This is to give the vigilante group a legal framework to reduce crime as it was done in Lagos within three months of it’s operation.” On the issue of bribery, extortion and bail bonds from officers and men, the Commissioner urged the people to report any police officer who asked for bribe by dialling any of the 10 dedicated hotlines (07031823963, 07019358767, 09028528344, 09020047718, 09070512365, 09063143039, 08137607100, 09066095467, 09039515967) for prompt disciplinary action against both the officer involved and the DPO of the station. The Commissioner also promised to use his connections to ensure that a marine base is established in Itu and marine gun boat provided to ensure theft and other crimes are curbed in the Itu riverine area. Earlier, the speaker of the State House of Assembly, Rt.Hon Aniekan Uko, represented by member, representing Itu state constituency Hon. Kufreabasi Edidem, promised to continue with the vigilante bill as soon as they resume plenary.

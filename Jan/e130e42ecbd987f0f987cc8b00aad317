The police in Rivers State have arrested a fifty-two-year-old woman identified as Mama Vera for allegedly maltreating her two grandchildren between the ages of seven and eight at Mgbuoba in Obio-Akpor Local Government area of the state. Mama Vera was said to have stripped the grandchildren, sprayed them with pepper, tied their hands to the back and locked them in a room because they took some cassava flakes (garri) and sugar without her permission. Eyewitnesses said they broke into the house when they heard the children calling for help after their grandmother had left home for work. They also accused Mama Vera of denying the children opportunity to go to school. Meanwhile, a lawyer Precious Johnmark who also witnessed the incident called on the Federation of International Women Lawyers, FIDA to swoop into action and prosecute the woman. “Rivers State Police Command and FIDA should spearhead the prosecution of Mama Vera for allegedly violating the rights of the girls,” Johnmark said.

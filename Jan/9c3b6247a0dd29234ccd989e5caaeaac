The United States has reportedly denied a visa to Founder and General Overseer of the Living Faith Church, a.k.a Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo According to This Day, the embassy on Thursday said it denied Oyedepo visa because the Bishop did not qualify for visa renewal in its assessment. The Bishop while querying the grounds for his refusal, however, reportedly created a scene According to the Newspaper, Oyedepo was said to have told the embassy that he had been traveling to the states as far back as the 1980s and had not violated any rules or committed any crime to have warranted being denied a renewal of his visa. This DAY quoted a source as saying that the Cleric immediately sent for his bodyguards to get his phones so he could make some calls, but the embassy allegedly told him he could not make calls within the precincts of the visa-issuing section of the embassy. Recall that reports emerged last week, indicating that the President Donald Trump’s administration had plans to add seven countries across the world to the US travel ban list. For the new restrictions, countries on the list include Belarus, Myanmar (also known as Burma), Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania. White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley had said, “The travel ban has been profoundly successful in protecting our country and raising the security baseline around the world. “While there are no new announcements at this time, common sense and national security both dictate that if a country wants to fully participate in U.S. immigration programs, they should also comply with all security and counter-terrorism measures — because we do not want to import terrorism or any other national security threat into the United States.”

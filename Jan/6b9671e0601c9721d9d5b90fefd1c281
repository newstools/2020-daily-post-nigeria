Nigerian music star, David Adeleke popularly known as Davido was on Thursday night seen with his heartthrob, Chioma. DAILY POST recalls that Davido stirred up break-up rumors with his lover, Chioma weeks ago after a claim emerged that Peruzzi, his artiste, and Chioma had been in a relationship. The ‘If’ crooner also unfollowed his lover and baby mama, Chioma at the time. However, the relationship between Davido and Chioma seems to be sailing smoothly as they were seen in a cozy mood partying last night in Lagos. This is coming days after King Patrick, the Executive Producer at GoldenBoy Entertainment, made a revelation about how Peruzzi allegedly pimped Chioma to Davido as his cousin. “If you’re feeling stupid and you’re out there popping babies and giving girls STDs, don’t be sad, reach out to loved ones and get advice from your Huncho (reference to Peruzzi) on how to f*ck his Side Chick and pimp her out to you as his cousin. Let’s be guided, please. Incest is a Sin,” Patrick said. VIDEO:   A post shared by nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Jan 30, 2020 at 12:17am PS

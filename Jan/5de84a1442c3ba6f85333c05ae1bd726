Daily Nation newspaper reports that the church they co-founded is located in Mombasa. Congregants at the church told journalists that Elisha Misiko was seated on the front row when he walked over to his wife Ann Mghoi, who was at the pulpit. He stabbed her using knives hidden under his shirt, stabbed himself in the stomach and slit his throat as congregants rushed to the pulpit. Misiko died on the spot while his wife died in hospital.

Former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Bode George, has said he would soon declare his intentions on whether or not to contest the 2023 presidential election. George disclosed that he possessed the requisite knowledge and experience to make the country better. Speaking when he received some youth groups at his Lugard office in Lagos, yesterday, George said many Nigerians mooted the idea of the presidency to him but he was still keeping his card to his chest. He said: “Yes, people mooted that idea of presidential or no presidential but I keep my card to my chest. “People mooted it, initially we played and laughed over it but you see 2023 is a long haul from now and if people are wishing you well and are showing such good things to you, you don’t deflect it but time will tell.” George charged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government to focus on addressing the challenges facing the county. He said: “We know there are managers, our major concern should be what role are they playing. How well are they managing the resources of the country? “2023 is still a long time from now, that is about three years from now. Who knows who would even be alive by then? So, let us do the needful first and stabilize the platform on which you are going to move. “So, I want to thank those who have mooted the idea of the presidency and those who have spoken about it, but it is not tomorrow, it is not next week. It is not next month. “For me, I am more concerned now with the image of the country. If you see the image of our nation. I asked a simple question, where is that giant of Africa? You know that was our nickname before. “That is why I said everybody, in every corner, cool your temper. Hunger has no tribal marks, hunger doesn’t wear religious caps and it is all over the country. If the platform is wobbling, a little wind can blow it up. We must not pray for that,” he said

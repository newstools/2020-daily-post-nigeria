Nigeria’s electoral body, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Saturday, distributed election materials on a bare floor. DAILY POST reports that re-run elections are underway in 28 Federal and State Constituencies in 11 states of the country. The states are Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bauchi, Benue, Cross River, Imo, Kaduna, Kano, Niger, Ogun and Sokoto. Images INEC posted on its official Twitter handle at 7:05am, show sensitive materials in Niger State scattered on the ground. Ad-hoc staff are seen seated on the floor in a dark place and used torchlight to brighten the room. INEC posted the images with the caption: “Today’s Rerun Elections. Distribution of sensitive materials in Niger State a few hours ago. #RerunElectionsJan2020”. The sight is another illustration of how Nigeria, Africa’s biggest nation, handles its elections and processes. Meanwhile, the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, has assured Nigerians of high security for the polls. He also ordered a comprehensive security arrangement for all INEC offices and facilities in the affected States. Adamu appealed to politicians, candidates and the electorate, to ensure strict conformity to the rule of law.

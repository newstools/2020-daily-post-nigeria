The Nasarawa State Governor, Abdullahi Sule, has disclosed why the All Progressives Congress, APC, never thought of presenting a third term agenda to President Muhammadu Buhari. Sule stated that the APC was aware that Buhari will never accept such a move, hence the party never thought of a third term agenda. Appearing on Channels Television’s Politics Today, the governor said there are some people who belong to the school of thought that owing to his respect for the rule of law, Buhari will never accept to maneuver and change the constitution in order for him to remain in power. He said: “Whether the President says he is leaving or not, people like us believe he will leave because of his credibility and his rule of law and he is ensuring that he will leave by the constitution. “So this is not the president that will begin to manoeuver and change the constitution in order for him to remain in power. “I think the APC had never even thought about a third term agenda if it did, I was never a part of it because the man being talked about will not accept it. “Therefore I don’t think anybody will carry this kind of news and face the president about third term agenda, so if there is such news, I don’t think it will fly.” Recall that Buhari had last year assured Nigerians that he had no third term agenda. Buhari had declared that he won’t make the mistake of attempting to pursue a third term agenda. According to Buhari: “I’m not going to make the mistake of attempting a third term. “Besides the age, I swore by the Holy Book that I would go by the constitution and the constitution said two terms. “I know that I’m in my last term and I can afford to be reckless because I’m not going to ask for anybody’s vote.”

Abba Moro, Senator representing Benue South Senatorial District, has congratulated the state Governor, Samuel Ortom, on his victory at the Supreme Court on Tuesday. Moro said the Supreme Court judgment has laid to rest unnecessary dust raised by the opposition. A statement signed by his Media Aide, Ameh Godwin, said: “Senator Moro celebrates with the governor, the good people of Benue and the Peoples Democratic Party at large for the resounding victory at the apex court. “The court verdict has no doubt laid to rest the unnecessary dust stirred by the opposition over the mandate reposed on Governor Ortom by the people of Benue State during the last governorship election. “The Comrade Senator lauds the Judiciary for a sound Judgment, which has ended the needless legal tussle over the victory of the PDP at the polls. “The Senator reiterates his stand to continue to work with Governor Ortom and other political leaders to take Benue State to greater heights. Truly, in God we trust.” Recall that the Supreme Court had affirmed Ortom of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) as the duly elected in the March 9, 2019 general elections. The 7-man panel of the apex court had said it agreed with the concurrent judgements of the two lower courts. Delivering the judgement, Justice Sylvester Ngwuta had said: “I have agreed with the submissions of the respondents that the concurrent judgments of the Tribunal and Court of Appeal should not be disturbed.” But in his argument, Mr Jime’s lawyer, Yusuf Ali, urged the apex court nullify Governor Ortom re-election. Ali said the difference between the number of accredited voters recorded by the smart card reader machines used for the election and the number of votes recorded rendered the election invalid. “There must be an agreement between the number of accredited voters and the total votes,” Mr Ali explained.

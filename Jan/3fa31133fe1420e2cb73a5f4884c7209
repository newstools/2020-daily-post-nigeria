Doctors on Saturday boycotted duties following the indefinite strike embarked upon by house of the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, UNIMEDTH, Ondo State. During a visit to the Akure complex of the hospital, it was gathered that only consultants reported for duty with patients and their families lamenting over the situation. Recall that on Friday, the resident doctors commenced an indefinite strike over nonpayment of over five months salaries by the state government. Most outpatients, who expressed displeasure over the situation at the Akure complex, blamed the state governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu for not monitoring the operations of the hospital management. They noted that the governor should have guided the payment of salaries of all workers at both teaching hospital complexes just as he did for the civil servants in the state. One Mrs. Adetola lamented that she would have moved her brother’s daughter who’s on admission to a private hospital but for financial constraints. She also noted that Teaching Hospital is far better than private hospitals because of the array of specialists present to attend to any type of ailments. During the protest on Friday, Dr. Taiwo Olagbe, chairman, Media Committee, Association of Resident Doctors, UNIMEDTHC, declared that before they could return to work, all their arrears and backlog of salaries must be cleared. The doctors insist that their wages and remuneration must be paid directly into their accounts without any intermediary.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted that the gamble in bringing on Marcus Rashford against Wolves “backfired”. Rashford lasted just 15 minutes as United won 1-0, after a clash with Wolves defender Matt Doherty. The England striker is now a doubt for the trip to Anfield to face Liverpool on Sunday. “It backfired. You have got to take them [risks] once in a while. “He’ll be tested in the next few days – we have to see for Sunday. “He couldn’t run. He struggled a little bit with his back and got another knock. It didn’t help,” Solskjaer told the media after the game. United will face either Watford or Tranmere in the fourth round of the FA Cup.

On a daily basis, we turn to artisans, technicians, artists and other workers in various vocations to make our lives easier through the application of their skills. In recognition of their value and importance to society, Sterling Bank officially partnered with iCreate Africa to bring the most skilled people in various vocations from carpentry to plumbing, electrical installation, barbing,
shoemaking, makeup, fashion, auto mechanics, graphics design, tiling, robotics and fashion together in Lagos, Nigeria for a skills competition like no other.

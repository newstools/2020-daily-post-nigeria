Emerson Palmieri’s agent, Fernando Garcia has confirmed that his client would not be leaving Chelsea in this January’s transfer window amid interest from Juventus and Inter Milan. DAILY POST had reported that Emerson and fellow teammate, Marcos Alonso has been linked to join former Blues boss, Antonio Conte at Inter Milan, as well as Juventus. Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has been left unimpressed by his options in Emerson Palmieri and Marcos Alonso this season as the Blues seek to strengthen their left side this month. But Garcia has now stated categorically that Emerson is happy at the West London club. “Chelsea have no intention of depriving themselves of Emerson Palmieri right now,” Garcia told FC Inter News. “He’s happy in London and so now he won’t change clubs.”

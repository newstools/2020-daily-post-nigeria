Nine lawmakers of the Imo State House of Assembly, have defected to the All Progressives Congress, APC. This is coming few minutes after the Deputy speaker of the House, Okey Onyekanma, resigned his position. According to Vanguard, the defection saga started around 15:30 pm when the Speaker of the House, read the letters of the decampees at the floor of the House. The reason for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP lawmakers’ defection to APC was not clearly stated. This is coming at a time where PDP members took to the streets of Nigeria protesting the supreme judgement which nullified the election of PDP candidate Emeka Ihedioha.

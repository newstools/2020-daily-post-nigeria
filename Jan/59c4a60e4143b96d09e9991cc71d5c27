United States House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi called Facebook a “shameful” company on Thursday. The attack came amid escalating tensions between Democratic leadership and the company. CNN reports that the Speaker expressed grievance at her weekly press conference on Capitol Hill. Responding to a question about the power held by Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, Pelosi accused the company of being “accomplices for misleading the American people with money from god-knows where”. “All they want are their tax cuts and no antitrust action against them. “They didn’t even check on the money from Russian in the last election and everyone thought they should,” Pelosi said. Pelosi suggested that Facebook was in communication with the Trump administration. Facebook has come under intense criticism from Democrats for its policy of not fact-checking ads run by politicians. They argue that the policy will benefit Trump’s 2020 election campaign. Pelosi is a fierce Trump critic and has condemned many of his actions, tweets and comment.

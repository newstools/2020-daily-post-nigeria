Saudi Arabia has dismissed reports suggesting that the Kingdom’s powerful crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, was behind the phone hacking of Amazon founder and Washington Post owner, Jeff Bezos. “Recent media reports that suggest the Kingdom is behind a hacking of Mr Jeff Bezos’ phone are absurd. “We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,’’ the Saudi embassy in Washington wrote in a tweet on Wednesday The Guardian reported on Tuesday it was “highly probable” that Bezos’ mobile phone was hacked in 2018 after he received an infected video file via WhatsApp from the number used by Mohammed bin Salman. Bezos is the owner of the Washington Post newspaper, whose columnist, Jamal Khashoggi, was murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. In December, five people were sentenced to death in Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi’s murder.

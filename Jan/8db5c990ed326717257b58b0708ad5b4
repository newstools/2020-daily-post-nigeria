National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, has appealed to Nigerians not to trivialise the Supreme Court judgement on Imo. He said that the PDP would not join issues with those he claimed deliberately and knowingly undermined the country’s democracy. Secondus spoke when he led party chieftains to Emeka Ihedioha’s Abuja residence on Saturday. “In the case of Imo, we have more questions than answers because we can’t see the figures adding up. These are the questions agitating our minds and the minds of Nigerians. “I want to appeal to our brothers who are on the other side, to stop trivialising these issues. They are of fundamental importance in nature. “References are made in Sokoto, Rivers and Zamfara states. You cannot compare what happened in those states with Imo. “The other ones are intra party. Let them come out and tell us what really happened, from the Tribunal, to the Appeal court up the the Supreme court in the 388 polling units. “The truth is what we are seeking. We are not against speaking on very respected individuals, we are saying that the figures are not adding up.” He advised Ihedioha to be strong and not wary, as according to him, the truth would be revealed.

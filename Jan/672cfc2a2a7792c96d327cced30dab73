An 18-year-old victim of a human trafficking syndicate, identified as Victoria Oshioke, has narrated how her boyfriend sold her into prostitution for 500,000 cefa (about N350,000). Operatives of the Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) on Thursday rescued Oshioke, along with three other girls, from the leader of a human trafficking syndicate. One of the girls said she was first sold to the syndicate three years ago when she was 16-years-old and taken, first, to Cotonou, Republic of Benin and later to Mali to engage in prostitution. She, however revealed that she found her way back to Nigeria after she could not cope with the stress of having sex with different men. She told Dailytrust, “The syndicate took me to Mali where I was made to sleep with different men. I came back two years ago and later got a call from my boyfriend, Maxwell, that I should come to Benin. I was living in Auchi then. “When I got to Benin along with my elder sister, my boyfriend asked me to go back to Mali. “I refused. in the midnight, he threw us out of his apartment. For fear of being attacked, we agreed to go. “The next day, which was Tuesday, he put us in a bus coming to Lagos after calling his contact, who resides at Iyana-Ipaja.”

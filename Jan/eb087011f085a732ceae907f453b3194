Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta says defender, David Luiz was “disappointed” after he was sent off during the Gunners’ 2-2 draw against Chelsea in the Premier League on Tuesday night. He also said that Luiz was proud of his team-mates for not losing against Frank Lampard’s side. Luiz was given a red card following a strong challenge on Tammy Abraham in the first half of the encounter, as goals from Jorginho, Gabriel Martinelli, Cesar Azpilicueta and Hector Bellerin ensured both sides got a point each at Stamford Bridge. “It was a very special game [for David Luiz] but to get sent off the way he did,” Arteta told BT Sport. “He was disappointed but at the same time proud of his team-mates.” He added: “Time will tell if this is a stepping stone, but at least I saw a reaction. I demand from the players that they never give up, we have to keep playing with the spirit we showed in every game. “I’m proud of the way they reacted. They stepped up – if a team-mate makes a mistake they have to have their back. ‘It’s a good point in the end.” Arsenal will tackle Burnley in their next away Premier League fixture on Sunday.

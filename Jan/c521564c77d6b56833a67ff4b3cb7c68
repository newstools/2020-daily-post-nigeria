Manchester United are closing in on a deal with Sporting Lisbon to sign Bruno Fernandes, according to leading Portuguese journalist Filipe Dias. The 25-year-old midfielder was a target for United and Tottenham in the summer, but eventually stayed with the Portuguese side. Speaking on the latest edition of the Transfer Talk podcast, Dias said that Sporting will be forced to sell the midfielder due to growing financial difficulties. “The story so far is that United this time are really closing in on Bruno Fernandes,” Dias said. “We ran the story that there are talks between the two clubs and we figured that a deal might be close in the next few days, or hours even, because Sporting need money badly. “The situation has changed since last summer. They didn’t accept a deal with Tottenham for 70m euros but that would have been paid with 40m euros upfront and then another 30m. “Now Sporting will accept 70m Euros, but paid in instalments. United is a club that Bruno Fernandes really likes in England, it’s a club that he really wants to play for. “Talks have been intensified in the last couple of days, so we’re kind of expecting that it might be close.”

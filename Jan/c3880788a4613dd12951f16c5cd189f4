Chelsea midfielder, Mateo Kovacic, has revealed the club’s major problem this season under their manager, Frank Lampard. According to Kovacic, the Blues’ biggest problem this term is that Lampard’s men do not take their chances to score more goals against their opponents. The Croatia international said this while reacting to his side’s FA Cup 2-1 win against Hull City over the weekend. “It was a tough game, as we knew that it would be, but we need to score in the first half two more goals,” Kovacic was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying on Monday. “That’s our problem in this moment but obviously we’re happy to go through. “It was because we didn’t score on time – we had some chances and we didn’t use them. In training, we are working on it but we are still a young team, a new team, and we need to improve a lot. “We need to take our chances, which in this moment we are not doing great, but we have time to improve and I am sure we will do.”

Two rockets on Saturday fell on an Iraqi airbase that houses U.S. troops in the north of Baghdad. Rockets also fell in the city’s Jadriya area as well as the Green Zone which houses government buildings and several foreign missions, including the US Embassy. Dpa reports that no casualties have been reported. It quoted a source as saying the rockets landed on the depot area at Balad Air Base, where U.S. soldiers are based. U.S. soldiers were put on high alert, and helicopters hovered over the area. The attack might not be unconnected to the killing of Iranian commander, Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani, the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps’ elite Quds Force, was killed by a US airstrike on Friday. The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Iran-backed militia, Popular Mobilization Forces, which recently stormed the US embassy in Baghdad. President Rouhani visited Soleimani’s family where he reiterated Iran’s resolution to revenge.

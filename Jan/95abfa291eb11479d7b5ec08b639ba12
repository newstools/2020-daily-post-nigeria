Paris Saint-Germain striker, Edinson Cavani, has rejected a move to Manchester United, the UK Mirror reports. United are in the market for strikers after Marcus Rashford suffered a double stress fracture to his back. Rashford is expected to be out of action for approximately three months, leaving Ole Gunnar Solskjaer desperately upfront. Cavani is looking to leave PSG, having submitted in a transfer request. The Ligue 1 side are hoping to get around £20m for the Uruguay striker, with his current contract set to expire this summer. Cavani is believed to be keen on Atletico Madrid, despite interest from other Premier League clubs like United and Chelsea. United’s contract proposal offered was worth around £10m-a-year, plus a huge signing-on bonus, reportedly the same terms offered by Atletico.

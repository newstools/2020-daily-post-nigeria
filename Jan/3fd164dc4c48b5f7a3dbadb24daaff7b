Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has singled out seven Tottenham Hotspur players, Christian Eriksen, Dele Alli, Giovani Lo Celso, Lucas Moura, Son Heung-min, Serge Aurier and Ryan Sessegnon for praise ahead of his side’s away Premier League fixture against Spurs on Saturday. The German also revealed what he expects from Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho. Liverpool head to the game following a 2-0 victory over Sheffield United in their last Premier League encounter. “Expecting an organised Spurs side putting some emphasis on defending for sure, counter-attack,” Klopp said in his pre-match press conference on Friday, as reported by the Liverpool Echo. “Team is too good technically to do just that. “Eriksen, Alli, Lo Celso, lots of midfielders who can create with speed. Moura and Son, too. Aurier and Sessegnon have speed.” “We cannot be 100% sure what they will do but we have signs from what Mourinho did at Man United against us. “Different teams and players though. That is normal. “Our analysis always ends quite away from the truth. It is the same for us, we want to be unpredictable.” The kick-off time for the match is 6:30 pm.

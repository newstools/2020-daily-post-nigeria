Three persons on Monday died in two separate fatal road crashes in Ondo State. The ghastly accidents occurred on Benin-Sagamu highway around Ore axis of the road in Odigbo Local Government Area of the state. The first crash was said to have occurred around 7.40 am at the Ore tollgate involving a Lexus SUV with number plate KTU 141 FX and a truck with number plate EPE 72 SB. Two persons were confirmed dead, while three others were injured in the accident. The second crash was recorded to have happened around 1 pm at Kilometre 115 on the Ore-Sagamu Expressway, a few metres away from the Ore tollgate. It was gathered that nine persons were involved in the accident out of which one was killed and six were injured. The crash was said to have involved a Toyota Sienna space bus, which reportedly suffered a tyre blowout and the driver lost control of the vehicle, which somersaulted several times. Head of Operations of the Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC in the state, Segun Ogungbemide, who confirmed the crashes, said that they were caused as a result of excessive speed. He added that the corpses of the deceased had been deposited in the morgue of the Ore General Hospital, while the injured were taken to the same hospital. “The two fatal accidents are avoidable, because they occurred as a result of excessive speed by the drivers of the vehicles,” Ogungbemide stated. Ogungbemide advised the motorists to always comply with highway rules and regulations and avoid excessive speed.

Air France on Wednesday announced the suspension of flight through Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice. This is coming after Iran fired ballistic missiles against bases housing US troops in Iraq. “As a precautionary measure and following news of airstrikes underway, Air France has decided to suspend until further notice all flights through Iranian and Iraqi airspace,” an Air France spokesman said. DAILY POST reports that more than a dozen rockets were fired at two Iraqi military bases hosting US troops on Wednesday. The missiles were targeted at the Ain al-Assad base in Anbar province and a facility near Erbil’s airport in northern Iraq very early Wednesday morning. The Iranian action was a retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian commander in Baghdad. The killing of Iranian army General, Qassem Soleimani has inflamed tensions in the Middle East since Friday after US President gave reasons for his administration. Iran had vowed severe retaliation.

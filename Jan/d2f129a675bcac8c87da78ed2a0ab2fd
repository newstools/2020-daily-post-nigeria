Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has claimed Victor Moses retired from international football for football and age reasons. Rohr stated this in an interview with French radio station RIG 90.7FM. The German also pointed to Victor Osimhen as the replacement for Odion Ighalo, who retired from the national team after the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. “We no longer have a big star, because John Obi Mikel retired, that Victor Moses also retired for family and age reasons in particular … and even our top scorer, Odion Ighalo, declared his retirement after the AFCON 2019. “We managed to find a scorer with Victor Osimhen and other playmakers: we have Samuel Chukweze who plays at Villarreal, the little Samuel Kalu from Bordeaux who plays very very well with us – one of the best every time he plays with Nigeria – so we have a very, very young, promising team, and I might like to continue,” Rohr said.

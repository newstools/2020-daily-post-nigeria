Reports from Gamboru Ngala in Borno state, northeast Nigeria indicates that, no fewer than 38 corpses were counted as at Tuesday morning with more than 30 others injured following a bomb explosion targeted at people returning home from the market at the foot of the bridge linking Nigeria and Cameroon republic. Goni Malam Usman, a leader of the Nigerian Community who fled Gamboru to settle in the Cameroonian side told DAILY POST this morning that, the bomb detonated at around 3:00 p.m. when civilian JTF both on the Nigeria and Cameroon side were controlling crowd at the bridge. According to him, traders, youngmen and women as well as small children who were caught up in the rush hour traffic were hit by the bomb explosion leading to the death of 38 persons as at last count, Tuesday morning. “We do not know whether the bomb was planted when people started coming out or a suicide bomber carried it to the crowd. But it was devastating, the blow was too devastating for such in recent times. ” Usman said. He said, he too was at the market on Monday and was coming out to return home because nobody wants to delay in the market so as to avoid terrorists attack on the road. “The market usually close early, so I heard a loud sound of explosions, and I asked my friend Alhaji Ganami if that sound was some mortar fired by the military but he said he was not sure. Suddenly we saw smoke at the foot of the bridge and people running back. That was when we realised trouble was at the bridge. ” We waited for the security, but they took long before they arrive and kept people at a distance to avoid another catastrophic incident as this when they showed up. Being one of the community leaders, I took courage alongside some of the CJTF from my community and we went to the scene. It was horrifying! ” he said.

Who cares how good your script, code, design, music or movie is if you do not have the funds to build and market it? Over the years the creative industry has grown massively; despite the boom in recent years, one major challenge it still faces is financing. While creative minds want to expand and take their business to the next level, capital remain a major stumbling block, and has been for decades. In this life, there are just but a few problems money cannot solve, even in the much sacred creative industry. So you will understand why this video  got me really excited… things are about to change for creatives like you and I as UBA Creative Finance Loans is here now.

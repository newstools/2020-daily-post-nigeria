The European Union Council has asked Iran to comply with the 2015 arms control agreement that prevents it from developing nuclear weapons. EU Council President Charles Michel, said he had spoken to Iran’s President Hassan Rouhani on the developing issues in the region. Iran had during the week said that it was stepping back from its commitments under the deal, known as the JCPOA following US attack that killed Qassem Soleimani. “Just spoke with @HassanRouhani about recent developments. JCPOA remains crucial for global security. I called Iran not to pose irreversible acts,” Michel, who coordinates EU government positions in Brussels, said in a tweet. Soleimani, who was the Commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, was killed in a US airstrike on his convoy at Baghdad airport on Friday rising the tension of another World War. The airstrike, which was an order from US President Donald Trump, has since generated a lot of controversies and reactions from world leaders. Just yesterday, Iran launched over 15 missiles on US targets in Iraq in retaliation to the death of Qassem Soleimani, who was buried on Tuesday. Iran had issued another warning that any US retaliation to the missile attacks in Baghdad would lead to an all-out war in the Middle East.

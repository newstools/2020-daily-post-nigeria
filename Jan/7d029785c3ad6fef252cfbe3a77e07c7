Former Liverpool striker, Dean Saunders has urged the Reds to sign Tottenham Hotspur playmaker, Christian Eriksen. Eriksen’s current deal at Spurs will expire at the end of the season. The Denmark international has been linked with a move to Manchester United and Inter Milan in the past few weeks. But Saunders believes Eriksen will perfectly fit in Jurgen Klopp’s squad after his brilliant display in Tottenham’s 1-0 defeat against Liverpool on Saturday. “They (Liverpool) could spend it maybe… I think Eriksen could slot into Liverpool’s team,” Saunders told talkSPORT. “That type of player who will make their midfield a bit more productive.”

Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has disclosed that winger, Sadio Mane will not play in his side’s Premier League clash against West Ham United on Wednesday night. Mane suffered a “muscle tweak, during Liverpool’s 2-1 win at Wolves last Thursday. The Senegalese forward was forced off in the first half of the Premier League clash, after trying to link up with Mohammed Salah for a counter-attack. There were no obvious signs he was in serious pain, as he disappeared down the tunnel. “Sadio will not be involved for West Ham and probably not for Southampton,” Klopp was quoted by Liverpool’s official website as saying at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. “After that he should be then fine. “The week we have then after that is for him perfect to get back on track. “He has a small muscle tear, which is serious enough to keep him out. We were lucky with the injury as well, so it was not that serious. “But of course, when you have three games in a week then that means he is out for these three games.” The kick-off time for the match is 8:45pm.

Real Madrid will not have Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema available, when they play Valencia in the Spanish Super Cup on Wednesday. The pair join Eden Hazard on the sidelines, ahead of Los Blancos’ trip to Saudi Arabia. Bale and Benzema both played in a 3-0 victory over Getafe in LaLiga on Saturday. However, a statement on Real’s official website on Monday, read: “After the tests carried out today by the Medical Services of Real Madrid, our player Karim Benzema has been diagnosed with a lesion in the semimembranous muscle due to bruising on his left leg.” The Blancos added on Bale: “After the tests carried out today, Gareth Bale has been diagnosed with an infection in the upper respiratory tract.”

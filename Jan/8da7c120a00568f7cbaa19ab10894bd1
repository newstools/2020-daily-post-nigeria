Two medical doctors and a pregnant woman have died over suspected lassa fever infection at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital (AKTH),Kano. The two doctors, a house officer, Ummu Khulthum and anaesthetist consultant, Habibu Musa were reported to have attended the pregnant woman, who died after surgery. A credible source in the Hospital told DAILY POST that apart from the two doctors and patient, many people who had contact with the patient were currently sick and have been isolated. A statement issued by the Kano State branch of the Nigerian Medical Association said blood samples of all those in contact with the patient who died last week have been taken to the Nigeria center for Disease Control (NCDC) for confirmation. All efforts to speak with the spokesman of the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, Kano proved abortive. DAILY POST also learned that the Kano State Ministry of Health and management of AKTH are currently in a meeting and will address the press soon after. More details soon â€¦.

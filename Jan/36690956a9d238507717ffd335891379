The Niger State Government will commence the payment of the new National Minimum Wage this January. Governor Abubakar Sani Bello made this disclosure on Tuesday when he received Chairmen of the 25 Local Government Areas. He said that a committee has been set up already and considerable progress has been made in an ongoing negotiation to begin the implementation of the new minimum wage. “At the moment, our top priority is to address those that have been affected directly by the minimum wage and what it means is, anyone who is below the minimum wage policy”. “I have given the directive that it should be implemented this January, so that those that are entitled or fall within the class of minimum wage will get”, he said. According to him, those that are not directly affected by the N30, 000 minimum wage will be taken care of in the next phase which is the consequential adjustment. “If you implement the new minimum wage, then you find out that there will be the need for consequential adjustments for all”.

Paris Saint-Germain manager, Thomas Tuchel, says forward, Neymar is the ‘leader’ the club hoped for this season. The Brazil international has been on top form in recent weeks for Tuchel’s men after recovering from a groin injury earlier this season. The former Barcelona star has scored 11 goals and registered 5 assists in 12 Ligue 1 appearances for PSG so far this campaign. “For Neymar, there are a lot of words to describe him,” Tuchel told a news conference ahead of PSG’s clash with Lorient in the Coupe de France on Sunday. “But the best thing is to watch the games. He is really decisive for us, he closes spaces, he defends. “He is the leader we hoped for and it is a really good time for him. The challenge is to keep going, to employ the same effort, the way of working and the mindset. It is good but it is just the beginning. It is only January.” “I am convinced that football is based on team effort,” Tuchel added. “We attack together and we defend together and if we do that, we are a dangerous team. If not, we are an average team and you cannot win any big thing as an average team.”

The Governor Samuel Ortom-led Benue State Government has approved the sum of N30, 000 new minimum wage for civil servants in the state. This was disclosed to DAILY POST, on Thursday, by Ortom’s Adviser on Labour Matters, Hon. Ode Enyi. According to Enyi, Ortom gave the approval during a meeting in the state. He said: “Buhari approved N30. 999k today at a meeting.” On when it will take effect, Enyi said: “We are yet to conclude the consequential adjustments and when that is done we will get a date of the take-off.” Recall that Ortom had in December last year said his administration was willing to pay the N30,000 national minimum wage but would do better if the revenue sharing formula undergoes an upward review. Ortom stated this while explaining that an upward review of the revenue sharing formula in the country would ensure more money was made available to states and local governments for greater development. He had spoken at the Benue Peoples House in Makurdi, the state capital, when the Federal Commissioner representing Benue State at the Revenue Mobilisation, Allocation and Fiscal Commission, RMAFC, Chief Adaa Maagbe paid him a courtesy visit.

Manchester United have decided not to sign Christian Eriksen from Tottenham Hotspur this January, according to Sky Sports. The Red Devils have been linked with a £20m move for the Denmark midfielder, who is out of contract at the end of the season, but no bid has been made. United held discussions with Spurs about a deal for Eriksen last summer, but the player ended up staying in London. It is understood that Eriksen sees his future away from the Premier League and is likely to be on his way to Inter Milan. Inter’s chief executive, Giuseppe Marotta, confirmed their interest in the player earlier this week, but insisted they have had no discussions with Spurs yet.

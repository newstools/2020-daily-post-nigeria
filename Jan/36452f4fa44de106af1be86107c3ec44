Ukraine has reacted to Iran’s clarifications that it actually fired down the airline that killed over 170 passengers on Wednesday, according to CNN. Ukraine’s President, Volodymyr Zelensky has issued a statement following Iran’s claim that it accidentally fired down the plane. The jetliner, a Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, went down on the outskirts of Tehran during takeoff just hours after Iran launched a barrage of missiles at US forces in Iraq. Zelensky’s statement added, “This morning was not a good one but it brought the truth. Even before the International Commission could finish its work, Iran admitted to shooting down the Ukrainian plane. “But we insist on a full admission of guilt. We expect Iran to conduct a full and open investigation, bring those responsible to justice, return the bodies of the deceased, pay compensation and issue official apologies through diplomatic channels. “We hope that the investigation will continue without artificial delays and obstacles. Our 45 professionals need full access and engagement to establish justice.”

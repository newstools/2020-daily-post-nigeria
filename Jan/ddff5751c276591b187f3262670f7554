Police have denied the story of an attack on a Kaduna-Abuja bound passenger train. Kaduna State Police Command Spokesman, DSP Yakubu Sabo Abubakar, denied the incident. He said the command was not informed and has not received any information of any attack of such. However, a staff of the Nipgeria Railway Corporation in Kaduna who pleaded anonymity said the train was stoned by under-aged bystanders close to villages where there are substations who mostly hang around to have a look at the train. Also, a passenger on the train confirmed the stoning of the train, noting that the train was close to Jere junction when they heard the bang on the window. He denied attack by gunmen on the train that departed Rigassa train station at around 10.30 am on Thursday, noting that on many occasions the corporation has changed window glasses of the train as a result of stoning by underage bystanders in villages or rail crossing. There was an earlier report of an attack on the Kaduna Abuja train on Thursday by gunmen. The staff explained, “We have been warning underaged children in most of these areas to desist from throwing pebbles at the train whenever they come out to have a view of a passing train.” “The situation was what some people thought to be an attacked by gunmen, which the corporation is trying to sensitize the youth to desist from.”

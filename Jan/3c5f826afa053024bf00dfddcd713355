The Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Makinde Police Division, Oshodi, CSP Chinedu Nwamdi Chiemezie, has revealed the strategies deployed to tame criminal activities in Oshodi-Isolo Local Government Area (LGA). In a chat with DAILY POST in his office, the DPO said there was collaboration among the police stations in Mosafejo, Oshodi, Mafoluku and Shogunle, noting that the synergy produced great achievement. Oshodi-Isolo LG is one of the areas prone to criminal activities especially the menace of the various cult groups terrorising the community however, the crimes had reduced drastically towards the end of 2019. Chiemezie disclosed that though there was influx of criminal-minded people in Oshodi community; the police were able to tame them and stopped them from perpetrating evil in the community. His words: “We have been able to suspend the operations of the miscreants by the name ‘One Million Boys’ harassing Oshodi environment.” He continued: “The influx of miscreants every night at Oshodi – Oke along Apapa Expressway has been tamed with the joint efforts of our colleagues in Mosafejo police Division and the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) to ease crime and decongest traffic on the road. “Oshodi community has become inoperative for hoodlums to perpetuate their nefarious activities.” Chiemezie stated that they are on top of the crime management and control and would need the cooperation of the community to help their effectiveness. He, therefore, stated that the collaboration among the police and other security agents would continue to make sure Oshodi is totally free of criminal minded people.

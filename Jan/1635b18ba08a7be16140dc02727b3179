As the 2020 governorship election draws closer in Edo state, A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), High Chief Raymond Dokpesi, says the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), now has the golden lifetime opportunity to recapture the state with the present division in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Dopkesi disclosed this to newsmen on Friday at the PDP stakeholders’ meeting in Agenebode, the headquarters of Etsako East local government area of the state. The meeting preceded a tour of the zone, which is part of the ‘AFEMAI Declaration’ programme for the party. “The All Progressives Congress in the state is divided, hence a great opportunity for the PDP in the state.” “Stakeholders of the party in Edo north senatorial district will this morning commence a tour to the six local government areas in the zone. “The tour will provide an avenue for the leaders of the party at all levels in the zone to interact with the party members at the grassroots,” he said. High Chief Dokpesi, however, advocated for “a party structure that is all-accommodating.”

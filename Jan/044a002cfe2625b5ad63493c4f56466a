The Chairman, Ikosi-Isheri Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State, Mr Abdulfatai Oyesanya, is dead. Mr. Oluwaseyi Odufowokan, Chief Press Secretary to the late council chairman, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday that Oyesanya died after a brief illness. According to him, the council chairman died on Tuesday morning at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH). In November, Oyesanya stated that the council would not renege on the ongoing re-modelling and redevelopment of Ketu Fruit Market. Oyesanya said: “After due consultations with stakeholders, including royal fathers, and organs of state government, there was agreement on the redevelopment of the market into a befitting structure. “There is no one that matters that we didn’t carry along in this project. As a responsible and responsive government, we can’t convert the market into a residential estate. ““It is our pride and heritage, but modernity can’t allow us to leave it the way it has been. That’s what informed the redevelopment. “The security report has it that series of nefarious activities going on there, ranging from; armed robbery, dealing in hard drugs, rape, among other nefarious activities. “There are a lot of illegal traders in the market. We scarcely make N200,000 monthly rent from the market. This administration is not interested in denying anyone of their right by displacing them. “The protesters are being used by external forces to stall the redevelopment project. This is a Public-Private Partnership, PPP, on Build, Own and Transfer, BOT, which will take 30 years to transfer back to the government.” He spoke after a protest by aggrieved displaced traders, who claimed the management of the council had plans to convert the property into a residential estate. The traders staged a demonstration to the Lagos State House of Assembly, to protest the demolition of the Ketu Market by council officials.

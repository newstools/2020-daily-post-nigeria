Paris Saint-Germain defender, Layvin Kurzawa, will prefer a move to Arsenal over Inter Milan, ESPN reports. The Gunners have spoken with Kurzawa, but are not the only European club interested in the left-back. The 27-year-old left-back is into the final six months of his contract with PSG and will not sign a new deal. However, Arsenal are ready to snap him up in January, rather than wait until the summer. With Kieran Tierney and Sead Kolasinac both injured, the Premier League side is keen on Kurzawa’s low fee and the idea that he could be revived by a new challenge. PSG believe Kurzawa can fetch up to €10million, even though they were not expecting interest in him this month.

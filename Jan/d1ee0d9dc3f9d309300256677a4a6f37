Residents of Oyo town in Oyo state on Sunday woke up to the news of an early morning inferno that gutted more than half of the town’s main market, Akesan. As at the time of filing this report, no one could quantify the worth of property lost in the inferno. It was gathered that more than half of the market was gutted by the fire which started around 2.00 am. Witnesses say only a filling station close to the market waa spared. Our correspondent gathered that the inferno consumed almost the entire market as a result of poor response from the fire service stationed opposite the market. Some residents had this to say, Mr. Iyanu Daniel said, “Akesan market in Oyo is on fire this morning (5th of January) yet there’s a fire station close to the place and they couldn’t prevent it from turning into to a raging fire. Something for the state of things in this country”. Omobolaji Okediji said, “It’s even more saddening that the nearest fire station is just next to the market that even if they lay their hoses from their office, it would get to the burning shops. But they couldn’t do anything. This country has expired. Akesan Market razed completely”. However, all efforts made by DAILY POST to get the reaction of the Oyo state fire service proved abortive as at the time of filling this report. But, the State Police Command while reacting, maintained that the Police personnel have been deployed to the scene to prevent hoodlums from capitalising on the situation to loot shops and properties. Police said, “Contrary to widely spread news on the fire incident at Erekesan market in Oyo town, there was no single shot from the Police personnel in Oyo. “Police personnel were deployed immediately to the scene to prevent hoodlums from capitalising on the situation to loot shops and properties in the area. “Concerted efforts are being intensified to prevent breakdown of law and order.”

Aisha Yusufu, co-convener of the BringBackOurGirls (BOG) advocacy group, has dismissed the denial by the Department of State Services (DSS) that Abubakar Idris (aka Dadiyata) was in its custody. Dadiyata is a strong critic of the governments of President Muhammadu Buhari and Abdulahhi Ganduje, the Kano State governor.
Peter Afunanya, the spokesman, in a statement on Tuesday, said that Dadiyata was taken away from his house by some armed men does not suggest that those men were DSS staff. “For the sake of emphasis, the Service has no reason to deny its arrest and detention of suspects if actually it carried out operations during which such persons were arrested”, he said. “It is not out of place for security and law enforcement agencies to arrest and detain law breakers or those suspected to be. The arrest and detention of suspects are procedural and undergo continuous review. “In certain conditions, some are routinely questioned and released while others are granted administrative bail. Some who are still under investigation or already undergoing prosecution are held on the basis of court orders. “Suspect handling is a critical aspect of the Service’s responsibility and this is taken seriously without any form of compromise. “It diligently carries out this function in strict compliance with the criminal justice administration system and intelligence governance procedures absolutely necessary for consolidating democratic ideals in Nigeria”. In her reaction Wednesday night, Aisha rejected the explanation. She tweeted: “DSS/SSS that denied having Jones Abiri for over 2 years before releasing him want us to believe they do not have Dadiyata simply because they said so. #WhereIsDadiyata?” Dadidaya remains missing since he was whisked away in August.

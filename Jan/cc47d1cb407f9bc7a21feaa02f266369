Nigeria’s former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has reacted to the statement by Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore group that people of the Southwest are the ‘most primitive when it comes to politics.’ DAILY POST had reported that the National Secretary of the group, Alhassan Saleh, made the declaration while faulting people of the Southwest for supporting the establishment of Amotekun, a region security outfit. Featuring on Channels Television’s ‘Sunrise Daily’ programme, Saleh explained that people of the Southwest are very intolerant of opposition. When asked to confirm a statement credited to him saying that the Southwest may lose out in 2023 presidency with the support for Amotekun, Saleh, affirmed saying he was not trying to blackmail the Southwest by making such a remark. He said, “It is not blackmail. Unfortunately, with a very strong apology to my South-West friends, despite the education of the Yoruba people, they still remain the most primitive in terms of political culture.” But, reacting Fani-Kayode on his Twitter page stated that Saleh spoke like a true cattle rearer. He wrote, ”Spoken like a true cattle-rearer!” ”If the National Secretary of Miyetti Allah can describe the sons and daughters of Oduduwa as being primitive how should we now describe those that he represents?”

Former Holland striker, Robin van Persie, has blamed Manchester United’s midfielders for their 2-0 defeat to Arsenal on New Year Day. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, started with Nemanja Matic, Fred and Jesse Lingard in midfield, with Paul Pogba out injured. However, the Gunners raced into a two-goal lead, thanks to Nicolas Pepe and Sokratis. There were no goals in the second half, as Arsenal won their first game under Mikel Arteta. Van Persie, who played for both teams during his career, told BT Sport: “I do believe the reason why United were so flat is because the midfielders were not giving those final balls. “Nobody was giving those balls. Rashford, I had him down for 15 great runs. Martial similar. He didn’t recieve one. Why? Partly quality.”

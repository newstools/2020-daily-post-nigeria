Egor Magistrates Court in Benin, on Monday, sentenced Udoh Effong, 26, to one month in prison for stealing a laptop from his employer. The Magistrate, Esohe Ighodan sentenced Effong, after he pleaded guilty to stealing and begged the court for leniency. Ighodan, however, gave the convict an option to pay a fine of N10,000. According to the Magistrate, the convict was sentenced based on facts and exhibits tenders. The convict, however, alleged that he took the laptop after the complainant refused to pay him his money, hence he carried his laptop and gave his friend to keep it for him. He added that his friend later gave the complainant the laptop, which complainant, however, denied. Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp Sunday Lucky, told the court that the offence was committed on Dec. 27, 2019 at upper Ekenwan , Ugbiyokho, a suburb area under the LGA. Lucky said that the convict stole a HP laptop valued N68,000. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the provision of sections 390(9)of the Criminal Code Cap. 48 Vol. 11, Laws of the defunct Bendel State of Nigeria, 1976, now applicable in Edo.

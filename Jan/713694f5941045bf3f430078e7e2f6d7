The Corps Marshal, Federal Road Safety Corps, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, has ordered the immediate impoundment of trailers without proper latch. A latch is a metal bar with a catch and lever used for fastening a heavy item. A press statement on Saturday by the Corps Pubic Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, disclosed that FRSC has sealed partnership with the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to ensure that vehicles secured are not allowed to leave the Ports. Speaking on the dangers, Oyeyemi said that apart from the threat to lives and properties, “these containers when they fall lead to unnecessary road obstruction that causes undue hardship to motorists”. The statement revealed that the Corps will work with other law enforcement agencies to ensure the effectiveness of the new order. It urged the public to take advantage of the National Traffic Radio 107.1 FM or the toll free 122 numbers to report trailers seen on the highways without proper latch of containers. “Members of the public are encouraged to call 09067000015, 08052998090 to report such sightings”, FRSC added. Recently, the FRSC gave condition to motorists on the use of Google map while driving.

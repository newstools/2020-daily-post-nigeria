The Southern Kaduna Christian Leaders Forum has expressed confidence of a better future for Nigeria. The Chairman, Simon Mutumi spoke on Saturday at the 19th annual Southern Kaduna Prayer Summit held at the Township Stadium in Kafanchan, Kaduna State. The clergy stated that there was still hope for the nation contrary to perceived fears prior to the 2019 General Elections, NAN reports. He said: “Many people did not expect Kaduna and by extension, Nigeria to pull through with the aftermath of the general elections but God in His infinite mercies has shown His might and supremacy again. “Therefore, rather than bewail our misfortunes, we should acknowledge all that God has done and is doing in our midst and move forward.” He urged the government not to compromise the ethics that guide credible electoral process, adding, “we affirm that a level playing ground be allowed for all players”. “Unless and until the electoral process are critically looked into and addressed, we may never conduct just, fair and credible elections in Nigeria,’’ Mutumi said. A former Minister of Aviation, Mr Femi Fani-Kayode, who was the Special Guest of Honour, at the occasion stressed the need for the people of Southern Kaduna to be united and champion a common front. Fani-Kayode, who was represented by Rev Emmanuel Olorunmagba, advised them to desist from scrambling for political position based on ethnic and religious affiliations. “I charge the people to rise above every form of opposition and reconfigure your thinking system and salvage the future. The National Secretary of ECWA, Rev Yunusa Nmadu, urged the people to be strong and unwavering in their faith in God. “In the face of every predicament, do not be afraid because fear has the potency to render you blind and incapacitated instead, stand strong and trust God that your salvation will surely come,’’ he said.

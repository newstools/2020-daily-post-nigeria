Former US President, Barack Obama, has mourned the passing of Basketball legend, Kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, died in a helicopter crash on Sunday in Calabasas, California. All other persons on board were killed and the cause is under investigation. KB is survived by his wife Vanessa, and their three daughters – Natalia, Bianca and their newborn Capri. He won five NBA championships and the 2008 MVP Award with the Los Angeles Lakers. In his reaction, Obama tweeted: “Kobe was a legend on the court and just getting started in what would have been just as meaningful a second act. “To lose Gianna is even more heartbreaking to us as parents. Michelle and I send love and prayers to Vanessa and the entire Bryant family on an unthinkable day.”

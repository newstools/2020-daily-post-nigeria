Minister of Niger Delta Affairs , Senator Godswill Akpabio has distanced himself from the ongoing rerun election in Essien Udim local government area of Akwa Ibom State. DAILY POST had reported that the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state on Friday announced its decision to withdraw from the race. It alleged a perceived bias of the electoral umpire, the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) in the state. In a press conference on Friday evening at the party’s secretariat in Uyo, the state Chairman of the party, Mr Ini Okopido said “APC has withdrawn from the re-run election in Essien Udim local government area as we are dissatisfied with the conduct of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state.” Speaking on Saturday, Akpabio in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Anietie Ekong, said his decision to stay away from the supplementary election was ‘sacrosanct.’ He said, “The news flying about linking Senator Godswill Akpabio to any rerun election in Essien Udim Local Government Area is fake. “It is well known that because of higher national responsibilities as Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Akpabio had withdrawn his candidature from the said election. He was replaced by the APC with Obongemem Ekperikpe Ekpo. “The other candidates who were scheduled for the elections, Rt Hon Nse Ntuen and Rt. Hon Emmanuel Akpan have written to announce their withdrawal from the elections,” the Nation quoted him as saying.

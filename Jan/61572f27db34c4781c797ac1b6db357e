Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has revealed that Christian Pulisic has picked up a “nasty” thigh injury in training. Pulisic will be out for a few weeks and misses out on the home game against Burnley this weekend. “It is a damaging miss,” Lampard told reporters on Friday. “Before Christmas he did report a bit of tiredness so he came out of the team and I was worried about him picking up an injury. “He was in pain when it happened. He’s a good player that provides competition in wide areas and can make things happen. He was in good form for a period. “He picked up an injury a day before the Forrest game. [An] injury in the abductor, a tendon injury. Nasty injury, he was in paid when it happened.” Pulisic scored a hat-trick against Burnley earlier in the season, following a lack of first team football when he first arrived at Stamford Bridge last summer.

Former Arsenal manager, Unai Emery, has urged Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar to seek for a transfer move back to the Spanish La Liga. Emery, who coached Neymar during his time at PSG, believes the Brazilian star has all the attributes to become the best player in the world. DAILY POST had reported that Neymar attempted to engineer a move back to the Camp Nou during the summer, just two years after his world-record €222million transfer to Paris Saint-Germain. However, a deal did not materialise despite Barca’s efforts. “He is 27 years old and has all the conditions to be the best player in the world,” Emery told Cadena SER. “In Spain I would like him to come back because the best players have to be in the best teams. “You hear a lot that he will return to Barcelona. I also left to go to PSG, but now that I’m in Spain, I think Neymar has to come back.” Emery is currently out of job after he was sacked by the Gunners last year.

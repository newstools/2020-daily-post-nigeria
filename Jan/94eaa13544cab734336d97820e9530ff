Ronaldinho has detailed how he was involved in Lionel Messi’s development at Barcelona. The Brazilian star arrived at Camp Nou in 2003 and was at the club when a teenage Messi began working his way into the Catalans’ first-team. Ronaldinho, speaking with Panenka magazine, has now revealed how he spoke to then manager Frank Rijkaard to bring Messi on board. “When I arrived at Barcelona, there was already talk of a kid [Messi] who stood out. “Then we were friends; we started playing together and we got on very well. He arrived being different to all the others, and we spoke with [Frank] Rijkaard so that he came to train with us – it was all very fast. “I was lucky enough to give him the pass for his first goal. “Over time, it’s very nice to see someone who starts out so close [to you] and then conquers the world. “We were always very close. We learned things, he taught me Spanish and I taught him Portuguese, but with the ball we understood each other perfectly. “I’d be left amazed by how calm he is. That’s something I love about him; he never gets into trouble, he’s always with his family and those closest to him. “Leo has everything, he didn’t need anything from me,” Ronaldinho said.

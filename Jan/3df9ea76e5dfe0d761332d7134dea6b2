Gov. Simon Lalong of Plateau says henceforth kidnappers caught in the state will face death penalty.
Lalong said this on Thursday at Shendam Mini Stadium during the coronation and upgrade of three chiefdoms in Shendam Local Government Area, NAN reports. He said that kidnappers were relocating from other places to Plateau because of the “heat” they were experiencing in their evil business in those places. “People are saying they should come to Plateau because there is no death penalty here, but it is no longer business as usual here. “I have sent a bill yesterday to the state assembly in this regard and when passed, we will effect it,” he said. The Governor charged the upgraded leaders to discharge their duties diligently as custodians of culture, saying they would be held responsible for any security challenges in their communities. “Traditional and community leaders will be held responsible for any breakdown of law and order in their communities. “You have the duty of mobilising the people toward maintaining peace and order,” he said. He urged the youth to respect their traditional leaders and refuse to be lured to banditry, cattle rustling and other social vices. Lalong said his government would soon unveil empowerment programmes for the youth. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the State Government had upgraded three chiefdoms in Shendam local government area as part of efforts to bring the government closer to the people. NAN reports that the Long Dorok of Dorok Chiefdom, Miskoom David Dongba was upgraded to second class status in 2018; the Long Jaktoe of Doka kingdom, Miskoom James Lankwap , was upgraded to a third class Chief, while the Long Derteng of Derteng kingdom, Miskoom Thomas Yunkwap III was also upgraded to third class.

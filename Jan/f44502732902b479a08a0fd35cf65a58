Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will hand Harry Maguire the captain’s armband, when Ashley Young seals his exit from the club, according to The UK Sun. Young is the current skipper, but the 34-year-old is eager to join Inter Milan, after seeing his playing time significantly reduced this season. Despite only moving to Old Trafford in August, Solksjaer will pick Maguire as his replacement. With Young frequently out of the side, Maguire has effectively shared the role with him this season. Solskjaer had in the past praised Maguire’s leadership skills and has labelled him a “warrior” this week. Young joined Manchester United in 2011 and has made 261 appearances.

Former Manchester United striker, Robin van Persie, has claimed manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer lacks the fear factor necessary to get the best out of the team. United lost 2-0 to Arsenal on New Year Day, as Mikel Arteta sealed his first win in charge. Van Persie, who fired United to the Premier League title under Sir Alex Ferguson, was left unimpressed by Solskjaer’s ability to command the players. “You need a bit of fear for your coach,” he said on BT Sport. “Yes, firstly, the game plan, but you need a bit of fear for your coach. “If you have that, then you know that if you don’t make those runs, if you don’t play those balls, you will get punished. You won’t play the next game.” When asked if this was missing under Solskjaer, he replied: “Probably. By the look of it, I think so, yeah.”

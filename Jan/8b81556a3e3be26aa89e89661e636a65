Barcelona manager, Quique Setién says he has confidence in his captain, Lionel Messi and the rest of his players following their 5-0 win over Leganes in the Copa del Rey on Thursday. He also said that forward, Ousmane Dembele will soon recover from his injury. Barcelona defeated Leganés at the Camp Nou to qualify for the quarter-finals of the competition, thanks to goals from Antoine Griezmann (1), Clement Lenglet (1), Lionel Messi (2) and Arthur Melo (1). “I have confidence in the players I have,” Setien was quoted by FourFourTwo as saying after the match. “We have to think about what there is and we are happy because in a few weeks we will recover Dembele.” “We have done very well for the first 20 to 25 minutes, we have been precise and we have had control,” the 61-year-old added. “It is true that they could have hurt us and that they have reached us. “Do not see I am completely satisfied because we have lost control at some points in the game, especially at the end of the first half,” he said.

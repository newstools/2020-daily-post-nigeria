The Tiv Area Traditional Council has summoned the Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, to appear before it over his alleged uncomplimentary and derogatory remarks against the Tor Tiv, Professor James Ayatse. DAILY POST had reported Akume made scathing and derogatory statements against the Tor Tiv, accusing him of partisanship – (tor pati) meaning king of politics. Akume allegedly castigated the church in Benue State, calling Pentecostal denominations (where the Tor Tiv fellowships) in particular as insignificant groups who have no electoral value. Reacting in a communique issued, signed by Tor Kwande, Chief Ambrose Iyortyer and the Secretary, Mr. Shinyi Tyozua, the Tiv Area Traditional Council resolved that the Minister be summoned in writing to come and explain the weighty allegations against the Tor Tiv and the custodian of the Tiv tradition. Part of the communique reads: “On the issue of the uncomplimentary and derogatory remarks against the Tor Tiv, the meeting noted the weighty nature of the allegation. It was therefore resolved that the Honourable Minister of Special Duties and Inter-governmental Affairs, Senator George Akume, who is a Tiv son, should be urgently formally invited in writing to appear before the Council and defend himself on the allegation.” It also cautioned Tiv sons, daughters and their allies, especially those involved in politics to desist from acts capable of generating tension, bad blood, acrimony and hatred within the polity for peace to reign in the land.

Liverpool have set a new club record after beating West Ham United 2-0 in the Premier League on Wednesday night. Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool side march towards their first ever Premier League title in 30 years. Liverpool headed to West Ham, having won 22 of their opening 23 League games to become favourites to win their first League triumph since 1990. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Mohamed Salah fired the Reds to victory in east London. They are now 19 points clear of champions Manchester City in second position. It was Liverpool’s first league game against West Ham and the win marked another milestone for this team. Liverpool’s win in east London meant that for the first time ever, the Reds have now beaten every other opponent in a single League campaign. West Ham were the only team that could have denied Liverpool that target. They now have 14 more games to try and match the Arsenal ‘Invincibles’ in going a whole Premier League season unbeaten.

The Speaker of Edo House of Assembly, Francis Okiye, on Wednesday, debunked the allegation that Gov. Godwin Obaseki induced the crisis rocking the assembly and the All Progressives Congress (APC). Okiye in a news conference held in Benin City was reacting to a claim by the former Secretary to the State Government, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, that the governor’s mishandling of the assembly proclamation caused the crisis in APC. Okiye said that the governor did everything possible to prevent the crisis that was forced on the party by some political gladiators,” NAN quoted him as saying. “For the record, the debilitating controversy that has engulfed the polity and the state APC actually predated the proclamation by the governor for the inauguration of the seventh assembly. “If not, our brothers who are today victims of power control quest would not have waited for an alternative proclamation after the office that is constitutionally saddled has done so. It was a wrong move. “It is important to make clear that the problem that created this avoidable crisis was as a result of some persons wanting to dictate the political affairs of the state at the expense of the governor,” he said. According to him, if we as politicians must fight in anyway we must never do so to the disadvantage of the our state. Okiye, however, explained that the failure of the former lawmakers-elect to present themselves for inauguration led to the declaration of their seats vacant. He said “we did what we did not to hurt anybody but to bring sanity to politics and governance in our state and to assert the importance of legislative arm of government.” Meanwhile, Obaseki has threatened to expel Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the APC.

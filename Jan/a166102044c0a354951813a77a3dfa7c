Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has identified midfielder, Phil Foden as the player that will eventually replace playmaker, David Silva at Etihad. Guardiola said this before Man City’s Premier League clash against Aston Villa on Sunday evening. Silva is set to leave Man City on a free transfer at the end of the season after spending ten years at the club. The 34-year-old’s current deal with the Citizen will expire at the end of the season. “Phil is an incredible player but he still has things to improve,” Guardiola said as quoted by Express UK. “Sometimes it takes time to understand exactly what he has to do and sometimes you have to be patient. “But when I say many times that David is going to leave this season and we are not going to buy any player in his position it is because we have Phil. “Maybe this season Phil will have more minutes, or maybe less, I don’t know. But we trust Phil. “If we didn’t believe in him we might go to the market to replace David, but we have Phil. “He is the guy who is going to take David’s minutes or maybe he has to fight with Kevin De Bruyne, Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva who can all play in that position. “So that’s the only way to maintain the level as high as possible.”

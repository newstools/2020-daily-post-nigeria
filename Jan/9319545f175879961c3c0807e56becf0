Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has responded to the criticism directed at him by Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp ahead of the league game on Sunday. Klopp had criticised Manchester United’s playing style. Dismissing Klopp, Solskjaer also predicted that his young side will rise to the challenge of frustrating Liverpool once more on Sunday. Klopp accused United of negative tactics after the 1-1 draw at Old Trafford in October. But Solskjaer said he would take Klopp’s evident displeasure as a compliment. The Norwegian told a press conferenc, “I take it as a compliment that we defended so well and they’ve not really created chances against us “When the opposition manager is frustrated, that is a good sign for you that our boys have done well. “We’ve played them at Old Trafford twice and been closest to winning both games. So we’ve got some games to look back on that will give us some belief.” Solskjaer insisted his young squad would be up for the challenge of becoming the first team to beat Klopp’s men in the league this season. Solskjaer said: “[I have] no safety fears. Of course they want to try to intimidate us as long as it’s within the boundaries. “I’ve been sat on a coach going to Anfield and whatever they shout and scream at you, you don’t really notice. “You’ve got to look forward to these games. It’s a great challenge for our players to play against the league leaders. It can be an intimidating place but I’m sure it will be fine.”

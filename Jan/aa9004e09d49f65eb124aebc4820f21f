The Kano state Electricity Distribution Company KEDCO did not find it easy in it’s revenue collection in 2019 as the Company is said to have lost energy worth N52 Billion Naira Supplied to it by the Regulators. Speaking while unveiling new Customer Strategy and Company award and Empowered Conference, the Managing Director of the company Mr Jamilu Isiyaku Gwamna said KEDCO cannot meets its obligations with the serious problems facing them. The Managing Director noted that they have introduced several measures to curtail energy loss and lack of staff commitments to Company growth as well as revenue collection, which slows down the company in meeting its obligations. One of the strategies adopted includes direct Tariff Monitoring, Feeder supervision and moves to ensure only Revenue paying Customers are provided with power to curtail lost and wastages. Gwamna worried that billing system being used by the company has serious problems with the balance sheet and that is why the company has adopted three new methods of enhanced operational capability, Customer Experience and serious Revenue drives. “Although, I should commend you all the staff on the 2019 performance which was so far the best by collecting N3 Billion Revenue but you should know that we are not yet there, because we need a projected N4 billion monthly revenue”, he explained. He added that, ” our efficiency is now hovering between 80-89 percent, we started at 56 percent, we should do all we could to improve on that, you can also see that our loss was 56% now beginning of this year we have seen the ratio falling to 36 percent, this is a good news that should be sustained.

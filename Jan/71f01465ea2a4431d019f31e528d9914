Tottenham Hotspur playmaker, Christian Eriksen, is close to sealing a £16.8m switch to Inter Milan. The move could see him earn up to £320,000 per week, tripling his current salary. Spurs have been keen to sell the Danish midfielder this month, to prevent him from leaving on a free transfer in the summer. “Daniel Levy looks like he is going to get what he wants yet again. “Spurs’ position from the beginning was that they were not going to accept less than €20m for Christian Eriksen even though he’s only got six months left on his contract. “Our information is that the deal hasn’t been done yet, but our colleagues at Sky Italy believe it is almost agreed. They say it is going to be a €20m deal and that Christian Eriksen is going to treble his wages. “He’s going to be signing a four-and-a-half-year deal and he will be earning £260,000 per week. With bonuses that could go up to £320,000 a week,” Sky Sports News reporter, Kaveh Solhekol, told The Transfer Show.

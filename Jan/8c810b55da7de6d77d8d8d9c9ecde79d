Gbagira village, a suburb of Awoye riverine community Area in Ilaje Local Government of Ondo State was during the weekend under siege following an offshore clash of the Nigerian Navy with sea pirates. According to a village source, the Naval officers stormed the village following the attempt to kidnap two foreigners on Thursday by sea pirates in the community. With the foreigners rescued by the naval officers, the soldiers were said to have continued to search the community for the arms and ammunition used for operations by the pirates. During the operation, it was gathered that one of the pirates was apprehended and handed over to security operatives by the villagers. The villagers added that, “the naval officers have continued to lay siege on the village since Thursday day till now (Saturday afternoon) in search of the criminals, arms and ammunition left behind by the fleeing criminals.” This development has put the village and neighboring communities under intense fear and tension while the waterways in and out of the communities have been cordoned off thereby paralyzing economic and social activities in the area.

Prof. Kareem Airede of Neonatal Medicine and Paediatrics expert, University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, has called for community-based action in support of exclusive breastfeeding. Airede told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Gwagwalada, Federal Capital Territory (FCT) that exclusive breastfeeding required family and community support to ensure proper infant nourishment. The paediatrician said it was proper to deepen campaign on exclusive breastfeeding at the community level. “The citizenry should help breastfeeding mothers to know the benefits of breast milk to the new born,” he said. According to him, breast milk is food for babies because its nutrients do not require universal precautions to handle. He said that breast milk contained adequate food supplements needed for effective growth of the baby. “Breastfeeding is best for growth, recommended for the first six months, it does not only save money for the family, it strengthens the bond between baby and mother. “I appeal to mothers to undertake six months exclusive breastfeeding; it is good for the health of both babies and their mothers,” said the expert. He said that properly breastfed children grew healthier and had high level resistance to child killer diseases. He called for a policy to promote work schedule for breastfeeding mothers to enhance productivity in the workplace for them.

The Supreme Court, on Monday determined the fate of five Governors. In the morning, Abba Yusuf of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) saw his appeal challenging the victory of Kano state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the March 2019 election dismissed. Recall that the appeal court had upheld the election of Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje. The Supreme Court also affirmed that incumbent Governor of Sokoto state, Aminu Tambuwal, was duly elected in the governorship election conducted on March 9, 2019. It, therefore, struck out the appeal brought by Ahmed Aliyu of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, challenging the said election. Later in the day, the apex court dismissed the appeal challenging the return of Simon Lalong as the duly elected Governor of Plateau State. The court in a unanimous judgment held that the appellants, Senator Jeremiah Useni and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), failed to prove allegations made against the victory of Lalong of APC in the March 9 governorship election in Plateau. Governors Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and his Plateau counterpart, Simon Lalong, also saw their elections affirmed. The two governors, who spoke with journalists after the judgements on Monday in Abuja, said that the apex court had proved that the judiciary was the last hope of the common men.

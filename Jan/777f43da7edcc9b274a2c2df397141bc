The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has warned against plans by the Federal Government to withdraw troops from troubled parts of the country. The President of CAN, Samson Supo Ayokunle, who was in Adamawa State on Sunday to commission the CAN state secretariat said withdrawing troops from the Northeast would boil down to policy sommersult on the part of the Federal Government. He urged the President Muhammadu Buhari to abandon the plan to avoid a policy somersault. “I call on President Muhammadu Buhari to abandon his planned withdrawal of troops from troubled regions. I see it as a policy somersault,” he said. He explained that government had taken steps that worked against insurgency in recent times and withdrawing troops now could leave room for insurgents to embarrass the government with resurgence of attacks. The CAN President who expressed appreciation to the government over successes against Boko Haram insurgency, insisted that the government would not do itself any good by withdrawing troops in a hurry. A major highlight of the CAN president’s visit to Yola was the commissioning of a N115 million CAN Secretariat, built by the Adamawa state chapter of the association. The CAN Chairman in the state, Stephen Mamza, is credited with the actualisation of the CAN secretariat, a major structure that had long been necessary but was never built.

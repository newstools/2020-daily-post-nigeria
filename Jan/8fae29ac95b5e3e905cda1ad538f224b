Chelsea youngster, Tariq Lamptey, is set to sign for Brighton after snubbing the offer of a new contract, Goal reports. The 19-year-oldâ€™s current deal expires in the summer, but the Blues were confident they would convince him to commit his future to the club. Manager Frank Lampard brought Lamptey on against Arsenal in the Premier League and he has played in both their FA Cup fixtures this season. However, Lamptey has informed Chelsea that he would not be signing an extension, prompting the Blues to accept an offer from Brighton to sell the youngster this month. The teenager believes he is ready for first-team football in the Premier League and sees Brighton as the ideal next step in his development.

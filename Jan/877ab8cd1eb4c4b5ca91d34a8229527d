Ex-Governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Dankwambo has revealed that he was nearly killed for championing the introduction of Treasury Single Account (TSA). Dankwambo spoke at the public presentation/book launch of “Treasury Single Account Policy in Nigeria” written by the Director, Finance and Administration, Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Salawu Zubairu. According to the immediate past Governor, “For people like me, we had to be given extra security, like they had to change our houses, we had to be accompanied by police because of the threats over the implementation of financial reforms.” He urged the President Muhammadu Buhari-led ederal government to strengthen all of Nigeria’s financial and treasury reforms. He noted that “except reforms are properly documented and supported by legal framework, politicians can take advantage of the inherent loopholes for political gains.” He tasked treasury officials and finance officials in government establishments to come with similar reforms. He added that, “I hope other reforms, similar reforms will be documented in this way. Going forward, for me that has also experienced the other side of the country as a politician, reforms can come and reforms can go. “These reforms must be made into law so that we politicians who come and go will not just come and take all these reforms for granted and waste them.”

Barcelona manager, Ernesto Valverde, was on Monday informed by the club that he will be sacked, Onda Cero reports. Speculation has grown around Valverde in recent days, following Barcaâ€™s 3-2 Supercopa defeat to Atletico Madrid. It has been confirmed that the LaLiga champions have held discussions with former midfielder, Xavi Hernandez, who is currently managing Al Sadd in Qatar. Xavi is, however, reluctant to take over at the Nou Camp mid season. He would prefer to take over at the start of the 2020/2021 season. Mauricio Pochettino and Quique Setien are among the other coaches linked with the Barca role.

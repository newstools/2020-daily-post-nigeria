Unai Emery has said he held talks with Everton about becoming their next manager. The Spaniard was sacked by Arsenal in November, but was close to remaining in the Premier League. Everton had fired Marco Silva around the same period and were looking for a manager. Emery, however, decided he wanted to take some time out of football. He told Spanish TV show El Larguero: “[Everton] was interested in me. I thought about it. “I didn’t say no, we had a three-hour conversation. They already loved me when I went to PSG. “I want this break to be a reflection. My first idea is to stay here in Madrid and go to Valencia and London. Then also visit my family in San Sebastian. “I have interested teams but I have not had any firm offer to return to training. “I long to return to work in Spain but I do not rule out anything.” Everton eventually appointed Carlo Ancelotti.

Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, has named four clubs that could end up as Champions League winners this season. They are: Liverpool, Real Madrid, Juventus and Barcelona. Mbappe himself is determined to go all the way with PSG, following their disappointing outings in the past years. The Ligue 1 champions have been knocked out in the last 16 for the last three seasons. Speaking to Gazzetta dello Sport, Mbappe said: “Juventus is a strong team who have demonstrated this in the Champions League in recent years. “With Cristiano Ronaldo they have a player who can help you win important things. “So this season Juventus are among the favourites with the usual candidates: Real Madrid, Barcelona and Liverpool .”

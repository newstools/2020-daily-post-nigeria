Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has criticised his players for showing ‘lack of quality’ on the ball following his side’s 1-1 draw with Brighton in the Premier League on Wednesday. Alireza Jahanbakhsh scored a late goal to ensure Brighton played a draw against Lampard’s men at the Falmer Stadium. Cesar Azpilicueta did score for the Blues in the first-half of the encounter. “It was an incredible equaliser but it’s two points dropped. We had control, opportunities to score,” Lampard told post-match press conference as quoted by Teamtalk. “We allowed them to feel like they are still in the game. We can’t stop the execution of the strike but they were bigger than us, with Lewis Dunk winning the initial header.” Lampard added: “We’ve got work to do. Christmas has been a small showing of our season. We should have had the mindset to kill it. It showed the good and bad of us. We must remain humble and work hard. There’s a lot of work to do.” “You have to deal with it in games, it’s part of the process. “You can accuse for a lack of fight and urgency but today was a lack of quality on the ball. “We just decided to not keep doing the simple things, not taking opportunities to score.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.

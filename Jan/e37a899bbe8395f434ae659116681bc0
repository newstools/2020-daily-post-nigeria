Anthony Joshua has revealed he is aiming to pull off a ruthless early knockout win over Deontay Wilder, if they eventually meet in an undisputed world title fight in 2020. Both boxers hold all four titles between them, with Joshua regaining his WBA ‘Super’, IBF and WBO belts in a rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr. Wilder defended his WBC belt with a seventh-round knockout win over Luis Ortiz. Analysing Wilder’s win over Ortiz, Joshua told Sky Sports: “He wouldn’t be there to do that in the seventh round. I would go in to knock him out. It’s heavyweight against heavyweight, champion against champion. “This is a serious fight, so I ain’t going to go in there to try and outbox him for 12 rounds, because of his punching power as well. I’ve got to go in there and take him out. Don’t let him get too comfortable in the ring with me.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.

Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has admitted his admiration for John Stones, but insists he is not looking to bring him to the Emirates. Stones has been linked with a loan move to the Gunners this week. It is believed the England defender is keen on regular football, ahead of the European championships this year. But speaking ahead of Arsenal’s game with Sheffield United on Saturday, Arteta has closed the door on the possibility of linking up with Stone, who he worked with during his time as Pep Guardiola’s assistant at the Etihad. “No truth at all,” told reporters, when quizzed on a possible move for Stones. “John is a player I really like. We followed him before we signed him when I was at City. “I worked with him for many years, I know him well and when I look at centre-backs he has many attributes I like, but we are not interested in him.”

Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola has explained that forward, Ian Carlo Poveda, left the club to join Leed United on a permanent transfer last Friday because he could not offer the 19-year-old more playing time at Etihad. Poveda made only one senior appearance in his Man City career before he penned a contract with Leed that will keep him at the club until the summer of 2024. Asked why Man City had let Poveda go, Guardiola was quoted by Manchester Evening News as saying after Man City’s FA Cup 4-0 win over Fulham on Sunday: “Because he’s young, he has to play, he’s not able [to play here] and Leeds is an incredible challenge to be training with one of the best managers in the world in terms of how he helps players to be better players. “For the way Leeds play it should suit his qualities perfectly. “I didn’t speak with Ian but either way it’s a really good decision for him.” Guardiola’s men will now take on Manchester United in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg tie on Wednesday.

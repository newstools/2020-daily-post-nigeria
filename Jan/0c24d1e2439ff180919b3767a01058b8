Barcelona have given up on trying to sign a striker in the January transfer window, to cover for the injured Luis Suarez, according to the club’s director of institutional relations Guillermo Amor. Suarez underwent surgery on a knee injury this month and is not expected to return to action until May. The Uruguayan is the only natural centre forward at the Nou Camp, with Lionel Messi still bearing the burden of goalscoring. Valencia striker, Rodrigo, was believed to be top of Barca’s list of targets, but the LaLiga champions were unwilling to meet his €60m (£51m/$66m) asking price. Amor has now confirmed that Barca have ended their search for Suarez’s replacement, as he told reporters on Friday: “Closing the market tomorrow night there were no optimal options to track a good negotiation to help the team.”

Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has described Manchester United’s tactics as “strange” and says they must “protect” themselves against counter-attacking football. Klopp once again questioned United’s strategy ahead of facing Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side on Sunday, having accused the club of “just defending” whenever they play Liverpool, following their 1-1 draw at Old Trafford in October. He has now warned his side to be ready for a similar situation at Anfield this weekend. “It’s strange when you play against a high, high-quality team as United still are, and they play the way they play. “It makes life really difficult. “We had it with Tottenham. That’s not normal, how can you expect that? On the other side, the counter-attacks are of the highest level in the world. “I don’t say they only counter-attack but it’s a main thing they do. People may want to see that as criticism, it’s not, but it’s just a description of the situation that makes life for us more difficult,” Klopp told reporters on Friday.

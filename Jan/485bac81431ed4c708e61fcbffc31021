Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, has urged the people of Akwu in Ankpa Local Government Area to sheath their swords over chieftaincy tussle, and avoid preventable violence. In a statement issued and signed by the Chief Press Secretary to Kogi state Governor, Mr. Onogwu Muhammed quoted the governor as saying that, there are procedures for appointment, confirmation and coronation of chieftaincy title in every chiefdom, and as such every lay down procedure should be strictly adhered to. According to him, “The governor, therefore, advises the people of Akwu to follow such procedures rather than taking laws into their hands, warning that his government would not condone any act of needless violence. “The governor warns that any further breakdown of law and order in the area will not be condoned and the perpetrators will face the full wrath of the law. “His Excellency, therefore, admonishes the traditional rulers to keep their doors opened to entertain complains from their subjects at all times in order to avoid unnecessary escalation of violence and ensure peaceful coexistence. “The governor sympathises with the victims of the ugly incident at Akwu, while assuring that the government through the law enforcement agencies will go after those who took law to their hands to forment violence, and bring them to justice. ”Every life is precious to us as government; anyone found with committing any act of violence for selfish reasons will face the full wrath of the law,” he said Meanwhile, efforts have been put in place to mitigate further escalation, as well as relief interventions to the affected persons.

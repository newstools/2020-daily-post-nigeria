Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has labelled Jose Mourinho “world class” ahead of their Premier League clash with Tottenham this Saturday. Spurs are looking to close the six-point gap between them and Chelsea, who occupy the final Champions League spot. Klopp’s team are yet to lose in the league this season and are 13 points clear of Leicester City at the top of the table. Although they are favourites for the clash, Klopp is not taking any chances against two-time Champions League winner Mourinho. “Jose Mourinho is a world-class manager with a specific mindset. I would say he wants to win with all he has. I respect that a lot. “That means each situation his team is in, he tries to use for his team,” Klopp told the media conference on Friday.

Manchester United’s chances of completing a deal for Shanghai Shenhua striker, Odion Ighalo, are “50-50” according to Sky Sports. The Red Devils are trying to bring in a frontman, with Marcus Rashford having suffered a long term injury. However, United face a race against time, to complete the transfer before the 11pm deadline in the UK. A £20m bid for Bournemouth striker, Joshua King, was earlier rejected and United are now looking at Ighalo. Tottenham also made their own late attempt to secure a six-month loan deal for the Nigerian, who has previously played in the Premier League for Watford. Spurs have explored a number of short-term options to cover for the injured Harry Kane this month, but are unlikely to get one in the January window.

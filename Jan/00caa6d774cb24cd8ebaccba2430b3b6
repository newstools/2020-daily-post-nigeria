The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has reacted to a statement credited to the presidency that it was okay to have cabal within the corridors of power. AYCF President General, Yerima Shettima in a chat with DAILY POST, charged Nigerians and those within the corridors of powers to discourage the issue of cabal in the Presidency. According to Shettima, only men of goodwill and determination can bring an end to the issue of cabal in the presidency. He said: “Well I feel the word cabal is a kitchen cabinet in any government, however, what is the business of this, is it in the interest of Nigerians or for their selfish interest? “Cabal should not be encouraged and if you go back and look at it again you will realise that every government has unforeseen forces within the corridors of power that decide what the most powerful man in government must do. “This shouldn’t be encouraged and we must begin to look at issues critically and those who are not supposed to be around power should be removed. It, however, takes men of goodwill and determination to do this because oftentimes, we realise that those unforeseen forces are more powerful than those appointed.” Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokesperson, Garba Shehu had recently dismissed the general beliefs that cabals were manipulating the President. Shehu had warned Nigerians to stop branding people cabal because they offered to serve the nation by being close to the President.

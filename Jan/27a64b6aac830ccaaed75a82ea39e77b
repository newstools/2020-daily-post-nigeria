Liverpool defender, Virgil van Dijk, has denied having any beef with new Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire. Van Dijk cost the Reds £75m from Southampton in January 2018. The Dutchman became the most expensive defender in the world then, smashing the £52m paid by Manchester City to Monaco for Benjamin Mendy six months earlier. But the record only lasted until August 2019, when United paid £80m to take England star Maguire from Leicester City. Both players will go head to head on Sunday at Anfield in the Premier League. Ahead of the game, Van Dijk says he had no tinge of disappointment when the England man went top of the transfer fee table. “No, good luck to him. There was always going to be a time when that was going to change because that’s the market. “He doesn’t have any influence on that. We players don’t have any effect on the price and it’s the same for him as it was for me. But the price does come with pressure,” Van Dijk told reporters.

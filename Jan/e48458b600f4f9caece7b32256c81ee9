Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted their fans have reason to be “disillusioned”, following a 2-0 defeat to Burnley on Wednesday night. Chris Wood and Jay Rodriguez scored either side of half-time, to hand the visitors their first win at Old Trafford since 1962. During the game, United supporters again chanted at American owners the Glazer family and executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward. A large number of fans also left the stadium before the game ended. “At the end you do feel disillusioned as you say, because maybe they do, but for us we’ve just got to stick to our values, stick to our beliefs and know there’s no use feeling sorry for yourself,” Solskjaer told a news conference after the game. “You’ve got to go out there with the same commitment tomorrow, the day after, get ready for Sunday.” Solskjaer also claimed that his squad, which has been stretched by injuries, need a break. “We know we’ve had a lot amount of games since beginning of December and they are very stretched. “Some of these have probably played more than they should have and expected, more mentally than physically I think they need a mid-season break. “We just need to get over that line, not get these three games out of the way but look forward to Sunday, the FA Cup against who knows who and there’s a chance then to get some belief back,” Solskjaer added.

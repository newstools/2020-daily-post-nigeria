As controversies mount over the crash of Ukrainian airliner Russian legislators have warned US and other nations to stop making “groundless” claims on how the plane crashed. The lawmakers accused the West of prematurely assigning blame to Iran. But Iran has since admitted firing down the plane. The Kiev-bound airliner carrying mostly Iranians and Canadian-Iranians crashed, killing all 176 passengers and crew minutes after takeoff from Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson had said that there is now a “body of information” that the airliner, which crashed shortly after takeoff in Tehran, was shot down by an Iranian missile Also, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the US had made a similar claim, revealing that it was actually Iran’s missile that shot down the Ukrainian airliner with 176 passengers on board But they all agreed that the action must have taken unintentionally. Iran had earlier denied the claim, saying it was impossible for such thing to have happened. Vladimir Dzhabarov, a legislator with Russia’s upper legislative chamber, said Friday that, “we need to be cautious with conclusions. Iranians have invited Ukraine to take part in the investigation. Why would they do it if they knew they had shot [the plane] down?” Also speaking on the matter, Leonid Slutsky, a legislator with Russia’s lower house of parliament, said conclusions about the cause of the crash could be politically motivated. “Facts and solid evidence are needed, rather than vague references to intelligence findings. So far it has all been groundless,” Slutsky said

There were protests in some states on Sunday over the Supreme Court judgement which sacked Emeka Ihedioha of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) as Imo Governor and declared Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as governor. In Ogun, the protesters demanded a review and reversal of the Supreme Court judgement in the interest of justice. Members of the Peoples Democratic Party carried placards which showed: “IMO judgement is a fraud,” “Our judicial system is not a department of the APC”, “Stop robbing PDP of its mandate,” “Stop influencing the judiciary”, ” Stop compromising our judiciary, ” and “Ogun PDP says no to injustice”. A similar protest occurred in Taraba, Gombe, among others. Last Tuesday, the court, in a unanimous decision, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue Uzodinma a certificate of return. A seven-man panel, in its decision held that Ihedioha did not win the majority of votes cast at the March 9, 2019 governorship election. The judgment delivered by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, held that the candidate of the APC won on grounds that he polled majority of the lawful votes cast at the election. The apex court held that the lower court erred in law when it rejected evidence tendered before them to the extent that votes from 388 polling units were not credited to APC and Hope Uzodinma. Kekere-Ekun said with the result from the 388 polling units, the APC governorship candidate polled majority lawful vote and ought to have been declared the winner of the election by INEC.

Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has responded to report linking captain, Ashley Young with a move away from Old Trafford. DAILY POST had reported that Young has been heavily linked with a move to join former Chelsea boss, Antonio Conte at Inter Milan. The 34-year-old’s current contract at Man United will expire at the end of the season. The former Aston Villa winger was left out of the Red Devils’ squad that were defeated 3-1 against rivals, Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-final first leg on Tuesday night. Asked about the future of Young at Old Trafford at Friday’s pre-match press conference ahead of Man United’s clash with Norwich City on Saturday evening, Solskjaer was quoted by the club’s official website as saying: “Ashley’s one of our players, he’s our captain. “There’s loads of speculation and we’ve just got to handle that. We’re getting used to that in this club and Ashley’s been very professional and focused, so I don’t think that’s going to change. ”It’s a discussion that me and Ash will have if something comes up. For us, we haven’t got too many players fit and ready, so we need the ones we have. “Ash has been very, very good for this club and he’s been a very good captain this season, so let’s see where we are in June. And we can see where we are in February as well.”

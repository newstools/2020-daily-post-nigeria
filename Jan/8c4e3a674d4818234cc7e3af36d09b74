Kano State Hisbah Operatives (Sharia Police) have arrested 32 suspected prostitutes. The prostitutes were arrested based on intelligence report as the operatives launched a combat operation on several dark spots in the state. All the suspects were, however, dressed in customized Hisba hijab as a major step towards comprehensive rehabilitation. Shaikh Haruna Muhammad Sandi Ibn Sina, Director General, Kano Hisba Board disclosed this while addressing the suspects at Hisba headquarters on Friday. “We have ordered a high profile investigation to establish the complicity of all the suspects. “The parents of all suspects would be invited for a crucial meeting with Hisba officials.” The Director-General, however, added that anyone found wanting would be made to face the law according to the dictates of Sharia.

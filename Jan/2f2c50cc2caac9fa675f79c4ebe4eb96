Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has admitted that he is not expecting the club to do “big things” in the January transfer window. Arteta is believed to be in the market for defensive reinforcements, especially with the long term injury to Calum Chambers. But speaking at a press conference on Thursday, the Spaniard said they will only make a move if they find good options. “If we can find something to help us go through the season in a more balanced way in certain areas, and is helpful, we’ll look at the options. “[I’m] not expecting big things. “However, I’m expecting big things from the players I have at the moment, the players that are recovering from injuries. That’s the biggest expectations from my side,” Arteta said.

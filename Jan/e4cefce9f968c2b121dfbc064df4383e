Former Liverpool player, Steve Nicol has claimed that forward, Sadio Mane could leave the club for Real Madrid if the whole ‘Real Madrid thing’ come up with the money for his signature. DAILY POST had reported that Real Madrid have reportedly made contact with Mane’s representatives over a potential summer transfer deal for the forward at the end of the season. Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane is a huge admirer of Mane and he is keen to link the winger up with Karim Benzema in the Los Blancos’ attack line next season. Speaking on reports linking Mane with a move to Real Madrid, Nicol told ESPN: “When it comes to Real Madrid, anything’s possible. “Players when they’re linked with Real Madrid, their eyes light up. “The question is – what’s this guy all about? “If he’s thinking about his career on the field of play, he’s staying with Liverpool because Liverpool will win the Premier League title this year and could do for some years to come. “They’re certainly going to be challenging in the Champions League. “If that’s what he’s all about then he stays but if it’s the whole ‘Real Madrid thing’ then it’s possible. “If they, as they normally do when they want something they come up with the money, I don’t think this is beyond the realm of possibility. “It’s not happening in the summer but after that I wouldn’t count it out.” Mane has enjoyed a fine 2019, scoring 54 goals for club and country last season, as he helped Jurgen Klopp’s side to win the 2018/2019 UEFA Champions League. The 27-year-old finished in fourth behind Lionel Messi, Virgil van Dijk and Cristiano Ronaldo during the 2019 Ballon D’ Or award in France.  Mane also led Senegal to second place at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, AFCON, in Egypt. The former Southampton star has scored 15 goals and registered 14 assists for Liverpool so far this season in all competitions.

The Supreme Court on Wednesday affirmed the election of Okezie Ikpeazu as Abia State Governor. DAILY POST had reported that an Appeal Court sitting in Owerri, the Imo state capital and headed by Justice R.A Adah, had struck out the appeal filed by the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate in the 2019 governorship election in Abia State, Alex Otti, and validated Governor Okezie Ikpeazu’s victory of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Earlier before the appeal court judgment, a three-man panel of the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Umuahia, Abia state capital, and chaired by Justice A.L.

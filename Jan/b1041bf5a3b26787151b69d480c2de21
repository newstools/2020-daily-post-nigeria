Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has emerged as Barcelona’s top choice to replace Luis Suarez, Mundo Deportivo reports. Aubameyang has 18 months left on his current Emirates deal and is yet to agree terms on an extension. The club’s bosses are now facing a dilemma over whether to cash in on the Gabon striker or risk losing him for nothing. Barcelona are monitoring the situation and could test Arsenal’s resolve before the January transfer window closes. The Spanish giants are eager to bring in a replacement for Luis Suarez, who is out for the rest of the season with injury. They are also believed to be keeping tabs on RB Leipzig’s Timo Werner.

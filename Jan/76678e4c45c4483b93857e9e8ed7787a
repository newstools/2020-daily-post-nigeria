The draw for the Copa del Rey round of 16 was conducted on Friday. There were no restrictions involving the top-flight teams in the draw, except that the lower-division clubs would get to play at home. Real Madrid will play second-division club Zaragoza, while Barcelona takes on Leganes. Defending champions Valencia have been paired with third-division club Cultural Leonesa, who eliminated Atletico Madrid on Thursday. The round of 16 will still be played in single-elimination games for the first time this year. However, the semi-finals will be decided with a home-and-away series. The only other matchup between first-division clubs will be Real Sociedad versus Osasuna. Sevilla will take on Mirandes, Athletic Bilbao play Tenerife and Villarreal clash with Rayo Vallecano.

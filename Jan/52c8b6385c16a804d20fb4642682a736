Super Eagles winger, Samuel Chukwueze, has said he is not bothered about missing out on the 2019 CAF Youth Player of the Year award. Chukwueze lost out to Morocco and Borussia Dortmund full-back, Achraf Hakimi, who was announced the winner for the second time. The Nigerian star was among a 10-man shortlist for the Kopa Trophy, which is the Ballon d’Or award for the best performing player under the age of 21, finishing in the ninth position. The 20-year-old was also listed for the Golden Boy Award won by Portuguese forward João Félix. “Better luck next time, I have already put the disappointment behind me,” Chukwueze told NationSport. “I have achieved a lot in 2019 but I need to do more. “I am very grateful for all that happened in 2019 but I now need to focus on what I can achieve this year.”

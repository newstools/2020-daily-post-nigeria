Senator Hope Uzodinma has received his Certificate of Return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) as Governor of Imo State. According to Channel TV, Uzodinma received the certificate on Wednesday, after the Supreme Court nullified the election of Emeka Ihedioha as the governor of the state on Tuesday. DAILY POST had reported that the Supreme Court in a unanimous judgment on Tuesday sacked Emeka Ihedioha as Governor of the State and declared Hope Uzodinma winner. It ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to withdraw the certificate of return from former Governor, Emeka Ihedioha and issue Uzodinma certificate of return as governor of the state. Delivering the judgment, Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun said the votes due to Uzodinma and APC from 318 polling units were wrongly excluded and should be added. Details later.

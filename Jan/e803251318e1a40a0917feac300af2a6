The Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, has vowed to kick out all troops of the United States, US, in the Middle East. Rouhani spoke while declaring that the late General Qasem Soleimani fought against terrorist groups, ISIS, Al-Nusrah and Al-Qaeda. Speaking on Wednesday in Tehran, Rouhani said most European capitals would have been in great danger if not for the “historic” fight of Soleimani. “General Soleimani fought heroically against ISIS, Al Nusrah, Al Qaeda et al. If it weren’t for his war on terror, European capitals would be in great danger now. “Our final answer to his assassination will be to kick all US forces out of the region,” he said. Soleimani was killed by a US airstrike in Baghdad airport on Friday. DAILY POST also reported that the US President, Donald Trump had disclosed that Soleimani was plotting to kill lots of American citizens but was caught in the process.

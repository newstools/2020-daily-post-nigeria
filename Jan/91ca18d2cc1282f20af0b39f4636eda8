Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed the players that will play and miss his side’s FA Cup third-round clash against Wolves on Saturday. Solskjaer’s men head to the game following a 2-0 defeat against Arsenal in the Premier League on Wednesday. Speaking to MUTV on Friday, Solskjaer said: “There’s a little bit of illness in the camp, but that’s normal through this time of year, so we just have to find out tomorrow who’s waking up okay. “Apart from that, players are coming back from injuries. Hopefully, we can see Axel soon. Tim and Eric are going to play Reserves games soon, hopefully. “Diogo’s back obviously, Marcos Rojo hopefully soon back, so we’re getting there. Solskjaer added, “There will be some changes. We need to look after the players.” “We’ve had a couple of youngsters doing well. Jimmy, Dylan but they’ve been injured and ill so they’ve lost quite a bit of football lately. They’re just getting back and I think we’ll see Jimmy on Monday in the Reserves. “Paul came back after a long spell out, two games, had a reaction, and couldn’t go to Burnley, as he felt his ankle was sore. We did a scan and it’s not the same injury, it’s a different injury. Of course, when you get that scan, we speak to him. ”You always consult your own medical people as well, like I did when I did my operation. You want the best second opinion and the advice was to have it done. It’s not a major one, and probably, as I said, three or four weeks “Sergio will play, he’ll be in goal. He’s been fantastic when he’s played. He’s played in the Carabao Cup a few times, he’s played in Europe. He’s sharp. “He’s played not enough for his liking but, whenever he’s been called upon, he’s produced.” The kick-off time for the match is 6:31 pm.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Wednesday arrested a suspected fraudster identified as Mark Obisesan for being in possession of suspected fake travellerâ€™s cheque worth $10,100. Obisesan who was accused of not having any known source of livelihood by the anti-graft agency, was arrested at his residence in Banana Island, Lagos. The anti-graft agency recovered a Ferrari 488 car, two i-phones, one Samsung phone, a laptop and ATM cards from the suspect. Before coming to Nigeria, the suspect was learnt to have served a 12-month jail term for Internet fraud in the United Kingdom. The suspect has, however, been granted provisional bail.

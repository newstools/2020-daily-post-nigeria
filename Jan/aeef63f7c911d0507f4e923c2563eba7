Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has called on his players to have a winning mentality and win trophies for the club. Arteta said this ahead of Arsenal’s FA Cup third-round clash with Leeds United on Monday night. Arteta’s men head to the game following a 2-0 victory over Manchester United in their last encounter. Arteta was quoted by FourFourTwo as saying: “Winning brings togetherness. When you have beautiful experiences together and win trophies those experiences stay within the group. “You like more the people you work with, you believe in them, you share some fantastic moments. That stays. “That habit of winning, winning, winning. When you win you don’t want to stop. You become addicts to that. We have to try to implement that at this football club.” The kick-off time for the match is 8:56pm.

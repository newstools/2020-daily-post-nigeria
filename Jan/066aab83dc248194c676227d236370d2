A former Commissioner for Finance in Kogi State, Chief Joseph Molemodile has been reported dead. This is coming barely 48 hours after the death of the vice-chairman of Kogi West chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Kola Ojo, who slumped and died on Tuesday while playing Tennis. It was learnt that Molemodile, the pioneer legal adviser of the All Progressives Congress in Kogi, died in the early hours of Thursday in his Jos, Plateau State residence. In a statement issued, on Friday, by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Information and Communication Strategy, Kingsley Fanwo, he confirmed the death. The statement read: “He brought a lot Of innovations and financial engineering to bear on the management of the state’s finances and continued to render selfless services to the State and humanity even long after leaving Office. “Losing such an enigmatic character at a time the State is refocusing her finances to serve the people and creating more opportunities is hard to take and also disheartening. “We shall ensure his name is immortalised to drive home the sterling rewards of service and patriotism that the late Chief Molemodile stood for.”

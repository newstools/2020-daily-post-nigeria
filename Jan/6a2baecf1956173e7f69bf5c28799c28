A Chief Magistrate Court in Port Harcourt has remanded one Francis Silas in prison for compelling his 4 -year-old daughter to eat her own feaces. The Court issued the remand order after arguments for his bail failed before Chief Magistrate John Enyindah following an application by the complainants, the Federation of International Women Lawyers, FIDA. Defense Counsel, EE Essien had asked for bail of her client, Silas arguing that the prosecution cannot appropriate and re-appropriate at the same time. Essien asked the court to discountenance the application for amendment of charges and go on with the charge preferred against the defendant. But FIDA Lawyers, led by Nnenna Igboukwu opposed Essienâ€™s bail application, insisting that the suspect was not properly charged. Chief Magistrate John Enyindah declined the application and adjourned to January 14 for continuation of hearing. The 30-year-old father of 2, Francis Silas who hails from Akwa-Ibkom State was arrested by the police in Rivers State on December 30, 2019 after the video showing him forcing his daughter went viral on social media. Francis Silas who is facing three- count charge was also accused of assaulting his daughter.

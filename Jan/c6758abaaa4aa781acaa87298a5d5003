President Muhammadu Buhari has highlighted some key achievements of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, the Independent Corrupt Practices And Other Related Offences Commission, ICPC, the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB, in the fight against corruption. Buhari said the anti-corruption agencies have helped in the recoveries of stolen funds, significant arrests of those suspected to be corrupt. Speaking at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Tuesday, Buhari said the anti-graft agencies have equally helped in blocking loopholes used in siphoning public funds. He also stated that the judiciary has made significant progress in the trial of suspected corrupt Nigerians. According to Buhari: ”These successes include significant arrests, recoveries of cash and properties purchased with stolen funds and the blockage of loopholes through which people siphon public funds. ”You may also have noted the progress made by the Judiciary in the trials of several cases and the sanctions and sentences being handed out to offenders. ”You will also be aware of this administration’s Financial Transparency Policy and the launch of the Open Treasury Portal at the end of 2019. This again is to improve on accountability, access to information for all citizens and the timeliness of financial information. ”You can see that a lot has been done, but there is so much more to do, as the cancer of corruption has deeply affected our country and our governance practices, and the fight cannot be won until all tiers of government and indeed the generality of Nigerians are determined to join the fight against corruption.’’

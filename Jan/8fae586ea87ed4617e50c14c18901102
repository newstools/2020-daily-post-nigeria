The Nigerian military says no fewer than 608 repentant Boko Haram insurgents are currently undergoing De-radicalisation, Rehabilitation and Reintegration (DRR) Programme by Operation Safe Corridor (OSC) at Malam-Sidi, Gombe State. Brig:- Gen. Musa Ibrahim, Commandant DRR Camp OSC, made this known when the Managing Director, North East Development Commission (NEDC), Mohammed Alkali visited the camp on Saturday. NAN quoted him as saying 14 of the repentant insurgents were foreigners from Cameroon, Chad and Niger Republic. Ibrahim said: “from inception we received 893 out of which 286 graduated and were returned to their respective states and countries for reintegration’’. He said the personnel in the camp were working diligently with the mandate of OSC in conformity with international best practices. According to him, the success of the programme will go a long way in restoring peace and security to the North East in particular and the country as a whole. Ibrahim said the programme was in need of five Hilux vans, additional vocational center, accommodation for camp staff and clients, and prompt release of funds to run the power generator among others.

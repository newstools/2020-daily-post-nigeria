Babatunde Fashola, Minister of Works and Housing, has said that state governments that desire roads must be prepared to pay compensation to citizens whose lands enter road construction plans. NAN reports that the minister said this on Monday when he commenced a two-day inspection of highway projects in Niger. According to him, every road project must pass through somebody’s land. “It is the responsibility of state governments and Local Government Areas to settle these challenges so that the Federal Government can face the problem of funding the construction of these roads. “I believe that we will help where we can; the stand of the federal government is that the states that want to see these roads delivered must deal with these challenges. “One of the issues that bring about such challenges is the land use act which is over 40 years. “The complaint of funding is already in public view that is why members of the press have been asked to join on these tours to see the real state of things. “The concern of Nigerians on government borrowing is legitimate, but the borrowing should be weighed with the problems they are used to solve. “People need the infrastructure; if they can see that the money borrowed is being used to deliver critical infrastructure, then their queries can be assuaged,” Fashola said.

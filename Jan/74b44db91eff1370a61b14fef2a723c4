Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that striker, Tammy Abraham will miss the Blues’ FA Cup fourth-round clash against Hull City on Saturday evening at the KC Stadium due to lack of fitness. Lampard’s men head to the game following a 2-2 draw with Arsenal in the Premier League on Tuesday. “The good news is he [Tammy Abraham] hasn’t fractured anything,” Lampard said as quoted by Chelsea’s official website on Friday. “We were worried about a small fracture or a hairline fracture. “He hasn’t got that. We have to see how it develops. It’s not a clear-cut one. “He’s not fit for this weekend [clash against Hull]. Whether he will be fit for Leicester after that I’m still not sure. “I haven’t got the news for you. It’s not clear at the moment.” The kick-off time for the match is 6:30pm.

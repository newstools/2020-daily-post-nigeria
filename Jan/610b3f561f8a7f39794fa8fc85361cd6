Newcastle United legend, Alan Shearer says he doesn’t see Manchester United getting into the Premier League top four this season. Shearer said this after Man United were defeated 2-0 by Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. Two goals from Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah ensured the UEFA Champions League holders defeated the Red Devils at Anfield. Man United’s defeat against Liverpool means Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men are now in the sixth position on the Premier League table with 5 points behind fourth-place Chelsea. “Manchester United are nowhere near the standard of Liverpool – and I don’t see them getting into the top four this season,” Shearer wrote in his column for The Sun. “Even if Marcus Rashford had been fit for yesterday’s clash at Anfield, they wouldn’t have beaten Jurgen Klopp’s runaway leaders. “Rashford might have made it a bit more difficult for Liverpool but let’s be honest, if Liverpool had been having one of their clinical days they could have been five up in an hour. “They should have been out of sight because they missed many chances. ‘Anthony Martial may have missed a sitter to make it 1-1, but as soon as he did that I thought “that is it”. Then Mo Salah deservedly got that second one on the break right at the death. “I don’t think anyone can argue that Liverpool were not far superior, that wasn’t a surprise in the slightest. United dug in but they are so obviously lacking quality in terms of where they want to be. “I said right from the off that letting Romelu Lukaku go and not replacing him was a massive mistake. “They needed a forward, whether Rashford was carrying an injury or not. They are desperate for one now and where do you find a top quality one in the January transfer window? Erling Haaland seemed the only one and they missed out on him.”

A massive protest is currently on going in Imo State over the Supreme Court judgement that sacked Emeka Ihedioha of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP) as Governor, and declared Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as the election winner. Hundreds of youths are marching through the streets, carrying banners, placards and chanting solidarity songs. Last Tuesday, the court, in a unanimous decision, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to issue Uzodinma a certificate of return. A seven-man panel, in its decision held that Ihedioha did not win the majority of votes cast at the March 9, 2019 governorship election. The judgment delivered by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, held that the candidate of the APC won on grounds that he polled majority of the lawful votes cast at the election. The apex court held that the lower court erred in law when it rejected evidence tendered before them to the extent that votes from 388 polling units were not credited to APC and Hope Uzodinma. Kekere-Ekun said with the result from the 388 polling units, the APC governorship candidate polled majority lawful vote and ought to have been declared the winner of the election by INEC.

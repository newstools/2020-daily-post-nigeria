The Youth and Women Leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the seven North-West states have vowed to recapture states controlled by the opposition in 2023. APC North-West Youth Leader, Alhaji Abubakar Fakai, and other APC youth and women leaders of the zone, made the declaration in Birnin Kebbi on Thursday, NAN reports. “Our women and youth in Sokoto, Kebbi, Zamfara, Kaduna, Jigawa, Kano and Katsina states will reclaim Sokoto and Zamfara states from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) during the 2023 general election,” he said. According to him, the North-West zone has the highest number of votes in Nigeria. “With that number, our youth and women leaders will mobilise their colleagues from the two states so as to recapture them for APC. “Sokoto and Zamfara are traditionally APC states. We lost Sokoto because the governor defected to PDP and Zamfara because of the internal wrangling in APC,” Fakai said. APC North-West Zonal Women Leader, Hajiya Yohanatu Ahmed, informed the leaders in the zone that youth and women constituted 65 percent of the total votes in Nigeria. “There is the need for governments at all levels to empower them in view of their positive roles in the success of Nigerian politics. “We must, as their leaders, discuss how youth and women who play vital roles in the success of our party during elections can be assisted,” Ahmed said.

The newly appointed Caretaker Committee Vice Chairman for Remo North Local Government has been kidnapped by unknown gunmen. DAILY POST gathered that Soniyi was kidnapped on Friday, along Fidiwo-Ipara road, by unknown gunmen, who whisked him away. This is coming barely 24 hours after the launch of Operation Amotekun. It was reported that the vehicle of the politician, which was earlier taken away by the abductors, was later found at Fidiwo, in Obafemi-Owode Local Government Area of the state. It was learnt that the abductors are demanding a ransom of N50million to free the council boss, who belongs to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). The incident has thrown the politician’s family and members of his party in the local government into disarray. DAILY POST recalls that a Chairman-nominee for Ipokia Local Government Transition Committee, Hon. Saibu Adeosun, died few hours to his screening on Wednesday. The state House of Assembly on Thursday confirmed the appointment of members of transition committees for 19 out of the 20 local government areas of the state. Meanwhile, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the abduction of the Vice Chairman. Oyeyemi, a Deputy Superintendent of Police, however, said the police were on the trail of the suspected kidnappers. “It is true but we are on the trail of the suspects. “The man was abducted around Fidiwo-Ipara road. We are on top of the situation and very soon, the victim will be rescued,” he said.

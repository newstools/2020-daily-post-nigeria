Iowa Democratic Congresswoman, Abby Finkenauer, on Thursday announced her endorsement for former Vice President Joe Biden ahead of the US 2020 presidential race. She becomes the first Iowa Democratic House member to back a candidate in the race. “Joe Biden’s character, record, and commitment to rebuilding the backbone of the country, the middle class is what Iowa and this country needs. “Across the country, and especially in Iowa, too many families are being left behind by our current president. “It’s time we have leadership in the White House who believes in the value of not only uniting a divided Congress, but uniting our country through common sense, dignity, and respect,’’ Finkenauer said in a statement. Finkenauer’s endorsement of Biden is not a surprise; she worked for his presidential campaign in 2008 and has referenced the former vice president when describing her ideology. Meanwhile, former San Antonio mayor, Julian Castro, on Thursday ended his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Castro, 45, a member of ex-President Barack Obama’s cabinet, said in a tweet: “It’s with profound gratitude to all of our supporters that I suspend my campaign for president today. “I’m so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together. I’m going to keep fighting for an America where everyone counts, I hope you’ll join me in that fight”.

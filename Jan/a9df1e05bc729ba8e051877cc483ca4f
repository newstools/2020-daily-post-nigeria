President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday inaugurated a 3.35-kilometre drainage channel project to address ecological challenges facing Idye Community in Makurdi, Benue. He appealed to the people to prevent the misuse of the project, such as filling the drainage channels with debris and refuse that could lead to another flooding or erosion. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Idye Community was among the worst hit areas of the 2017 flood that displaced over 120,000 persons in the Benue capital, Makurdi. The President, who was represented by Sen. George Akume, Minister of Special Duties and Inter-Governmental Affairs, said: “This project is one of the 17 ecological intervention projects approved by Mr President for the fourth quarter of 2017 and was awarded for execution by the Federal Executive Council on May 4, 2018 with a completion period of 48 weeks. “The importance of this project to the community cannot be over-emphasised as it is expected to address the devastating effects of erosion and flood in the community. “The completion of this project underscored Federal Government’s concerted efforts and sincerity of purpose in tackling problems of its citizens and making life more meaningful for the people of our great nation. “There is no doubt in my mind that the project will encourage and improve the health status, economic activities and the general well-being of the of this community,” he said.

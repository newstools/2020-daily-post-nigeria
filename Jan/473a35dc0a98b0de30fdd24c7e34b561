The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Thursday, cautioned President Muhammadu Buhari against any attempt to politicize or trivialize demands by Nigerians for his resignation due to his evident failure to guarantee security of lives and property in the country. PDP stated that the Buhari-led Presidency must accept this apolitical verdict, which transcends ethnic, political and religious boundaries, especially after Buhari admitted failure by expressing “surprise” at the level of insecurity across the nation under its watch. In a statement by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, the opposition party stated that the fact that the Presidency resorted to hauling insults, hate language and threats against patriotic Nigerians, including senators, instead of addressing issues of security before the parliament, showed that indeed, the Buhari Presidency has no answer to the litany of insecurity issues under its administration. The statement reads: “It is instructive for the Buhari Presidency to note that the Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe, whose voice resonated in the chamber of the Senate, spoke the mind of majority of Nigerians who had become bullied, harassed and despondent in the face of escalated insurgency, bloodletting, killings and other acts of violence that have pervaded our nation. “Senator Abaribe spoke on behalf of millions of Nigerians who have been killed, orphaned, widowed, maimed, rendered childless and homeless, as well as others who daily live in anguish, pain and fear in the face of worsening insecurity under the failed Buhari administration. “On account of this, the PDP counsels agents of the Buhari Presidency to perish any thoughts of harassment, setup, frame-up or victimization of Senator Abaribe who rose to the occasion through the constitutionally guaranteed privilege of the parliament to speak on behalf of ordinary Nigerians.” PDP recalled that “President Buhari, in 2013,unjustifiably called for the resignation of then President Goodluck Jonathan, the Jonathan Presidency never resorted to insults and threats, even when such a call was completely unfounded, unlike in the present situation where every indicator points to an alarming trajectory towards a failed state.” The PDP urged the National Assembly “to stand with Nigerians and resist every attempt that will make it succumb to any form of harassments, intimidations and innuendos from paid agents and cabal in the Presidency who have shown that the interest of ordinary Nigerians is not their priority.”

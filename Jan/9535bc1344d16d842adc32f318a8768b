Former Manchester United defender, Wes Brown has backed striker, Marcus Rashford to become the club’s greatest player. He also wants the 22-year-old to forget about reports linking him with a move to Barcelona. Brown said this ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash against Liverpool on Sunday evening at Anfield. Asked if he fears Rashford leaving Man United amid interest from Barcelona, Brown told Metro UK: “Not a chance. He’s been at United for many, many years and he’s home-grown. “He’s playing some excellent football and just made his 200th appearance. He’s scored more goals at this stage of his career than some of the top players in history,” Brown told Metro UK. “Marcus is a Manchester United player. He will only want to help the club and improve as a player. “He’s at that stage now where if he can continue like this, he does come into the greatest of all time bracket for United so I’m sure that’s what he’s thinking about.”

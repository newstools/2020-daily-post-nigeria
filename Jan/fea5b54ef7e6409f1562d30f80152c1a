The Federal Government of Nigeria on Saturday said officials of the various security agencies in Nigeria do impregnate teenage girls in their host communities. The FG, through the Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution (IPCR) said the situation has been creating conflicts in various communities across the nation. IPCR is an agency under the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saddled with the responsibility of resolving conflicts among individuals or groups. DAILY POST reports that the agency is primarily a research centre, a think-tank and an agency to strengthen Nigeria’s capacity for the promotion of peace, conflict prevention, management and resolution. Speaking at a seminar organised for women in Oke-Odan area of Ogun State on Saturday, a Senior Research Fellow in the IPCR, Mr Akangbe Oluwabamidele Moses, said, “Security agents are causing much conflicts in their host communities. Some of them impregnate teenage girls and this has been leading to crisis in those communities. This is aside from the usual problems they create.” Moses spoke further that women are needed for the promotion of peace in their various communities. He charged them to be agents of peace in all their endeavours; urging them to play active roles in politics. “You can contest for any political office in your area as a woman, especially when you notice those who have been holding those offices are not doing it right,” Moses said.

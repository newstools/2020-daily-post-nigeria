Manchester United legend, Ryan Giggs has slammed forward, Anthony Martial over the Frenchman’s poor performance in the Red Devils’ 2-0 Premier League defeat against Arsenal on Wednesday night. Arsenal defeated Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men at the Emirates Stadium, thanks to two goals from Nicolas Pepe and Sokratis. Giggs noted that Martial looked ‘lethargic’ as the club were searching for a goal against Mikel Arteta’s men. The Wales manager told Premier League Productions: “That gives a massive lift to the whole team. He [Lacazette] sets the tone. If you’ve got a centre-forward who is harrying, closing defenders down, it’s huge for the midfielders. You see a striker doing that, then you’re up with the play. “In contrast to Anthony Martial, who I did compliment, who I thought against Newcastle, against Burnley he was like that. But today he wasn’t. “Maybe he did press a couple of times and he looked back and the midfielders weren’t as compact as they should be. “ Giggs added: “But I think he is a victim of his body language. Like I said, the last couple of games he’s really tried. And I’ve felt that as a player, when you’re winning tackles and defending well, then you’re sharper when you do get the ball. “If you’re a bit sloppy and you’re not really closing down, when you do get the ball you don’t feel as good, you feel lethargic. “So I think that’s something he needs to do more and more consistently. Because as I say in the last couple of games he’s done it.”

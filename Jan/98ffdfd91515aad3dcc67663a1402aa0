Chelsea will reportedly sell striker, Michy Batshuayi to Premier League side, Aston Villla if Dean Smith’s men can meet their asking price of £50million for the Belgium international. According to the UK Sun, the Blues have rejected Aston Villa’s £45million bid for Batshuayi. The newspaper reports that the West London club will only allow the 26-year-old leave Stamford Bridge on a permanent transfer and not on loan. DAILY POST had reported that Aston Villa have contacted Chelsea over a possibility to sign Batshuayi on a short-term contract this month following Wesley Moraes’ knee ligament injury. Batshuayi is currently behind Tammy Abraham in Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard’s pecking order of strikers at Chelsea. He has been loaned out by Chelsea on three previous occasions to Dortmund, Valencia and Crystal Palace between 2018-2019.

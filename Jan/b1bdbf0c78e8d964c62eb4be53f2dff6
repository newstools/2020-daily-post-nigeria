Former Real Madrid and Liverpool striker, Michael Owen has predicted tonight’s Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg clash between Manchester United and Manchester City. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side will host Pep Guardiola’s men at Old Trafford. Man United head to the game following a 0-0 draw against Wolves in the FA Cup over the weekend, while Man City defeated Port Vale 4-1. “Manchester United won the recent league game between the sides at the Etihad but I expect holders Manchester City to take a lead into the second leg later in the month,” Owen was quoted by Mirror UK as saying. “With Marcus Rashford on the bench and Anthony Martial missing the game through illness, United failed to have a shot on target in their goalless draw with Wolves in the FA Cup at the weekend. “They will improve back at Old Trafford but, with Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay missing through injury, United do not have the quality in midfield that their neighbours do.” “City made serene progress in the FA Cup with a facile win over Port Vale on Saturday and I expect Pep Guardiola’s side take a lead back to the Etihad in the second leg.” The kick-off time for the match is 9pm.

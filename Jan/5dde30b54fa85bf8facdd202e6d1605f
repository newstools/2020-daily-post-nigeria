A Lagos-based clergy, Gbenga Aina, on Tuesday dragged his wife, Damilola before an Igando Customary Court, seeking dissolution of their 24-year-old marriage over alleged infidelity. Aina accused his wife, with whom he had three children in their 24 years of marriage, of having an extramarital affair with a man called, Shola. “Shola had on three occasions called to inform me that my wife is finally his and that I should forget about her. “Sometimes, he will call to start insulting and threatening me. “When I investigated, I discovered that he and my wife attend the same church. “I went to the church and I was told that Shola and my wife have been lovers for a long time,” he said. The 47-year-old petitioner alleged that his wife once abandoned their matrimonial home for three years without checking on the children. He prayed the court to terminate their union, claiming he was no longer interested and that he had moved on with his life. Responding, Damilola accused her husband of sending her out of his house, NAN reports The 45-year-old sales representative also denied having extramarital affair with any man. “I am not having any affair with Shola as claimed. I only chose to be close to him in order for him to help me travel out of the country. He is a travel agent. “Surprisingly, Gbenga came to my church to fight,” she said. “Although the matter had been resolved, I now know I did not play the game well,” she said. Having listened to the estranged couple, the President of the court, Mr Adeniyi Koledoye, adjourned the case until Feb. 27 for judgment.

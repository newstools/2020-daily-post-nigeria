President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad has reacted as the Department of State Services, DSS, denied abducting Abubakar Idris, aka, Dadiyata. Dadiyata a strong critic of Federal and Kano State governments was abducted by some men believed to be operatives of the DSS few months ago from his residence. However, DSS through its spokesperson, Peter Afunanya on Tuesday, said that Dadiyata was taken away from his house by some armed men does not suggest that those men were DSS staff. DSS had said: “For the sake of emphasis, the service has no reason to deny its arrest and detention of suspects if actually it carried out operations during, which such persons were arrested. “It is not out of place for security and law enforcement agencies to arrest and detain law breakers or those suspected to be. The arrest and detention of suspects are procedural and undergo continuous review. “In certain conditions, some are routinely questioned and released while others are granted administrative bail. Some who are still under investigation or already undergoing prosecution are held on the basis of Court orders.” Reacting to DSS denial, Ahmad in a tweet wrote: “My thoughts and prayers have been with Dadiyata from the first day of his abduction, together with his family, friends and well wishers, we thank and appreciate all security agencies’ efforts and we call on them to intensify the efforts until he’s rescued and back to his family.”

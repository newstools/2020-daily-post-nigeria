Mild drama ensued on Thursday at the University of Medical Sciences Teaching Hospital, UNIMEDTH, Akure, Ondo State, when some enrollees of National Health Insurance Scheme, NHIS, stormed the hospital over poor services. The enrollees, who paralysed activities at the clinic, protested against the management of the hospital for their continuous deafening silence on their predicament. The angry protesters, who chased the medical personnel, as well as other members of staff out of the clinic, were led by a Director of the Federal Scholarship Board, Mr. Michael Ogunwale, who explained that for almost one year, the NHIS clinic at the UNIMEDTH hospital had been maltreating them. According to Mr. Ogunwale, the clinic had not been providing the prescribed drugs to enrollees for the past seven months, as well as lack of access to doctors, a situation he said had led to the death of some patients. While emphasizing that they could no longer tolerate the poor service they were getting from the UNIMEDTH, Ogunwale called on the NHIS and the Ondo State government to take urgent action on the matter in the interest of all enrollees who relied on the scheme to get health care services. Reacting to the agitation of the enrollees, the Chairman Medical Advisory Committee, UNIMEDTH, Dr. Gbala Michael who had a closed door meeting with the protesting patients for almost an hour, promised to address all issues raised.

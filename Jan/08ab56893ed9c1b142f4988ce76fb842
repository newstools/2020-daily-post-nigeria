New Barcelona manager, Quique Setien once blocked the Blaugrana’s approach to sign £86million-rated Manchester United’s target, Fabian Ruiz, from Real Betis, Mundo Deportivo report. Barcelona, along with Man United and Real Madrid have been linked with Ruiz over the past several months. The Catalan club could have signed the 23-year-old midfielder for a measly £850,000 in 2017. But Setien was a huge admirer of Ruiz during their time together at Real Betis. The 60-year-old personally obstructed Barca’s approach for the Spain international before his £25million transfer to Napoli the following year. Ruiz has been impressive for Napoli since joining the club in 2018. He has scored six goals in 43 appearances for the Serie A side.

President Muhammadu Buhari has told Nigerian youths that the country cannot be divided for any reason. He advised the younger generation to keep a broader view of the country as one entity, and continuously de-emphasize ethnic and religious backgrounds in nation-building. A statement to DAILY POST on Friday by Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina said that the President stated this when he received the All Progressives Congress (APC), youth leaders, from the six geo-political zones in Abuja on Friday. He told the youths, “With all certainty, someday you will have to take up the mantle of leadership in this country, and you should be prepared for huge responsibilities. “Whether we like it or not, we will someday handover to Nigerian youths. And you have to brace up for leadership. Some interest groups will come up with ethnic, religious issues, but you have to look at the broader picture. “We had a civil war that consumed over 2 million Nigerians, and we learned our lessons. “Nigeria is one country, and no one should take our firmness for granted,’’ he said.

Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has defended his team’s style of play and insisted he will not change his coaching methods. None of Madrid’s six league goals in 2020 have been scored by attackers and the team has struggled to create chances. Zidane is however happy for his side to continue grinding out victories. “I don’t think the Bernabeu would accept a thousand passes without a shot,” he told a news conference on Tuesday. “Everyone has their own style of play. I played at the Bernabeu and what the fans want to see is their team give their all on the field. It has always been that way. “When fans see the team sweat for the shirt, that’s the most important thing in the end because you can’t always win. “I always say the same – I will not change. The important thing is the club have given me the chance to train these players. It is a great team and I am lucky to be here. “Two months ago things were not going well and there was a lot of criticism – that is not going to change. What we want is to continue what we are doing.” Madrid are unbeaten in 19 matches in all competitions and travel to Real Zaragoza in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey on Wednesday.

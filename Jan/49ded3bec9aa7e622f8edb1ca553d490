A doctor with the Federal Medical Centre (FMC) Yola, Abdurrahman Muhammad Kawuyo, who was kidnapped on Sunday, has regained his freedom. He returned home on Monday after his family paid N1,450,000 ransom, according to a family source. Dr. Kawuyo was taken from his Lakare residence in Yola South Local Government Area by gunmen that the doctor’s household now believe to be herdsmen. The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) disclosed Dr. Kawuyo’s release via a social media comment Monday morning. The association said, “Good morning distinguished senior colleagues and colleagues. Our colleague/brother, Dr Kawuyo has been released. Thank you all for your prayers and support. May the Almighty God continue to protect us all from criminals.” The NMA chairman for Adamawa State, Dr. Tounde Elijah, who later spoke on the development, said Dr. Kawuyo’s release is not enough reason to celebrate. “It is not enough to relax. We have to think of how to protect who would be next,” he said. He urged the authorities to do something about constant kidnapping in the land. “We’re aggrieved. The rate of kidnapping is so alarming. We must tell the government that our hard-earned sweat isn’t for kidnappers or any criminal,” he said. The police image maker for Adamawa State, DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, said by press time early Monday afternoon that he was yet to be briefed on the medical doctor’s release.

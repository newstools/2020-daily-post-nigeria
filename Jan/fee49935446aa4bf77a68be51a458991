The Royal Spanish Football Federation paid Real Madrid £2.55million (€3million) for winning this year’s Spanish Super Cup on Sunday night in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. According to the Express UK, Atletico Madrid also received £1.7million (€2million) for emerging as runner-up. DAILY POST had reported that Real Madrid clinched their 11th Spanish Super Cup on Sunday, after beating rivals Atletico Madrid 4-1 on penalties, following a goalless 120 minutes in Saudi Arabia. Diego Simeone’s men almost won the game in extra time, but Alvaro Morata was hacked down by Federico Valverde, as he raced through one on one with five minutes left. Dani Carvajal, Rodrygo Goes and Luka Modric scored for Real in the shootout, while Atletico’s Saul Niguez hit the post and Thomas Paratey saw his effort saved by Thibaut Courtois. Real Madrid captain, Sergio Ramos, made no mistake with his kick to hand the Los Blancos manager, Zinedine Zidane his 10th trophy as manager of the club. Zidane has also won all the nine cup finals he has taken the team to.

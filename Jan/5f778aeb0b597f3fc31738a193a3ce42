Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said that his former boss at the club, Sir Alex Ferguson, is the biggest influence on English football and not Pep Guardiola. Guardiola heads to Old Trafford with his Manchester City side on Tuesday night, for the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final. Ahead of the game, former Tottenham and Leicester striker Gary Lineker sparked a debate on social media, when he claimed Guardiola has had the most positive impact on the English game. Asked if agrees with Lineker, Solskjaer told reporters: “I must say he has had a big, big influence and since he took over at Barcelona I have admired Pep’s teams. “But I have to say I’ve worked under the most influential one. You do see one of the best managers ever and you can see where he’s taken his wisdom from. “I’ve had the pleasure of meeting Johan Cruyff back in the day when Jordi was here, and you can see similarities.”

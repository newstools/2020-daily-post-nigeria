Imo State Governor, Sen. Hope Uzodinma, has decried the nationwide protest organised by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), rejecting the Supreme Court judgement that declared him the governor of the state. Uzodinma made the remark on Monday, while addressing supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who occupied the streets of Owerri, in a solidarity rally for the party. He appealed to the President Muhammadu Buhari Government to call the PDP and its supporters to order, saying that the situation could degenerate to anarchy, if not checked. He further called on Imo residents to go about their normal businesses without fear of harassment and described the Supreme Court victory as divine, NAN reports. He said: “I am calling on the Federal Government to look into issues concerning the protest and caution the PDP against possible anarchy. “I call on you to go about your businesses without any fear of harassment. “My victory is divine and only God can remove me from office because I credibly won the election as has been affirmed by the highest court of our land.”

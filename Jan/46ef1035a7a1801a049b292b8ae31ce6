Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has asked for more time, as he looks to rebuild his squad and says rivals Liverpool are an example to follow. Solskjaer is under increased pressure after back-to-back defeats to Liverpool and Burnley. United are currently six points off the Champions League places and trail Liverpool by 33 points. Solskjaer, speaking to the media on Friday, insisted there will be no “quick fix” to improve their form. “For me, we do have a way of doing things. “Of course you can see other teams have done well. Jurgen [Klopp] spent four years building his team and they’re doing well now. I’ve said it so many times, it’s not going to be a quick fix. “It’s not going to be eight or 10 players in, in one transfer window. We’ve had one proper transfer window in the summer, because the January ones are difficult. But we are trying to do something now. “When you start on something you stick to that plan, for me anyway. “I’m not going to change six, eight, nine or 10 months into getting the job and start believing in a different way of doing things. “I’m going to stick to what I’ve been trusted to do by the club and hopefully that will be good enough, and that they can see what we’re doing is right. “It’s one of these jobs that… we know how football is nowadays, but all my conversations with the club have been positive,” he said.

The Adamawa State Government has introduced examination, which senior civil servants have to do before they could be considered for appointment as permanent secretary. Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, who disclosed this on Friday, explained that the idea of a promotional examination for potential permanent secretaries is to bring back lost glory of the civil service. The Governor spoke at the Government House in Yola during a special meeting with the candidates who wrote the examination for vacant positions of permanent secretary. He explained that such way of testing the competence of would-be permanent secretaries, which was once adopted, was reintroduced to ensure better civil service. Governor Umaru Fintiri saluted the panelists entrusted with the conduct of the exercise for a job well-done, as according to him, none of the candidates who wrote the exam complained to him about modalities for it. He congratulated them for participating in the exercise and assured them that those who secured the required marks would get the position. Earlier in his remark, the State Head of Civil Service, Dr Edgar Amos Sunday, thanked the Governor for not interfering in the examination process. The policy declaration did not come as a surprise to Adamawa people who have been following the grain of Governor Fintiriâ€™s thought on permanent secretaries and their bearing on the civil service. Towards the end of last year, on November 27, Fintiri ordered that permanent secretaries not on Level 17 when they were appointed should be dropped. He had said his government could not condone a civil service which, according to him, had been bastardized to favour some people.

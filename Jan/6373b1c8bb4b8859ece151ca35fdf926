Liverpool right-back, Trent Alexander-Arnold has said he and his teammate, Andy Robertson are bound to redefine the role of the modern full-back, adding that “no one wants to be a Gary Neville,” who is Manchester United legend. The Reds won their 11th consecutive match on Thursday night against Sheffield United with Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane on the score sheet. Robertson provided the assist for his side’s opener – his sixth of the season with teammate Alexander-Arnold already on eight. Speaking to BT Sport after the win, Alexander-Arnold hailed Robertson’s performance in the left-back position before taking a dig at the Manchester United legend. “Definitely, we are competitive within ourselves,” he said. “We have a competition between us to see who can get the most goals and assist and it pushes us. “As a pair, we want to change the way the position has previously been thought about. Obviously there was the famous saying ‘no one wants to grow up to be a full-back or a Gary Neville’. “We want to bring in a different way of thinking and that’s what we’ve been doing over the last 18 months.”

Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has named Liverpool as the team his side must learn from this season to get better next campaign. He also said that Man City must use their FA Cup fourth round clash with Fulham on Sunday and their Carabao Cup semi-final second leg tie against Manchester United on Wednesday to prepare for their UEFA Champions League last-16 tie with Real Madrid in February. “So Liverpool obviously will be champions of the Premier League but they would be champions in Spain, champions in Italy, champions in Germany, they would be champions everywhere,” Guardiola was quoted by Manchester Evening News as saying. “Twenty-three games, 22 victories, 1 draw, so it is impossible to handle it even in the best moments, we can drop points. After, in the recent past, when Chelsea won the league, the next season, they don’t qualify for the Champions League, Leicester the same and Chelsea again the same. “When we won the league, we repeat the league so we have decent results. To fight in Spain with the points we have we would be there, one or two points behind the leader, in Germany we would be there, one or two points behind the leader, in Italy as well but Liverpool is just fantastic, phenomenal, overwhelming, what they have done. “So we have to accept it and learn from that and be better to try to be close to them and still fighting to get better to finish second and to get better.” He added: “We have two games now to prepare for the [Champions League] knockout games, we can learn about how you handle the knockout game against Madrid, this kind of situations.”

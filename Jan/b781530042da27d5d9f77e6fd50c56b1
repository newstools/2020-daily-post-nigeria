A Magistrate court sitting in Port Harcourt has struck out the charges against the four young auto mechanics who were arrested, tortured and remanded by the E-Crack at the Nigerian Correctional Service. Chief Magistrate Amadi Nna struck out the charges and subsequently discharged and acquitted the four persons following the report of the DPP which reveals that the suspects have no case to answer. Chief Magistrate Nna ruled that the DPP reports advised that the charges against the Ikoku four by the police were unfounded and should not have come up in the first place, adding that they were mere speculations. Speaking with newsmen outside the courtroom, Director of Public Prosecution in the Rivers State Ministry of Justice, Ibiene Mbano said, “We discovered that the allegations against the boys were mere speculations and unfounded and it is not a matter we could be able to prosecute.” Counsel to the four accused, Morrison Opue welcomed the decision of the court and revealed some of the options before his clients on the way forward to seek total justice. Four persons were arrested alongside Late Chima Ikwunado and were arraigned by E-Crack on charges of robbery and cultism. This is happening after the auto mechanic, Chima Ikwunado died in the custody of E-Crack at Mile 1, Diobu Port Harcourt whom the Rivers state Police Command claimed died of High Blood Sugar.

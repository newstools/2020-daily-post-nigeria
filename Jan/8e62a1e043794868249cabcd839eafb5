Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, will miss three Premier League matches after getting sent off during the club’s 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday. The Gabon striker opened scoring at Selhurst Park in the first half, before Jordan Ayew equalized with a deflected effort. Palace midfielder, Max Meyer, looked to break down the flank before a late challenge from Aubameyang brought the attacker down. Aubameyang was initially shown a yellow card, but video assistant referee Craig Pawson performed his checks and eventually upgraded it to a straight red. He will now miss upcoming fixtures against Sheffield United, Chelsea and Bournemouth. Arteta said after the game: “I haven’t seen it but I think it was a harsh challenge. There is no intention to do it but maybe he mistimed it.”

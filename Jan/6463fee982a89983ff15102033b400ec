Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has hinted at starting Eddie Nketiah, when they play Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night, Goal reports. Nketiah was recalled from his loan spell at Leeds United and will stay with the Gunners until next season. The 20-year-old was given 16 minutes of action in the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United on Saturday, replacing the ineffectual Alexandre Lacazette. With Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang continuing his three-game suspension and Lacazette off form, Nketiah might be the leading frontman this time around. “Every player has a chance to start,” Arteta said. “[Nketiah] is in the squad. We will assess who is in best conditions to play in who is training well and we’ll make the decision based on that.”

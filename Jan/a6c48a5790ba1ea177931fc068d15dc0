Former Aston Villa striker, Gabriel Agbonlahor, has urged Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, to sign Nigerian midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi as Lucas Torreira’s replacement at Emirates. Agbonlahor believes Ndidi, who currently plays for Leicester City in England, would perfectly fit in Arteta’s squad. Asked if Ndidi can replace Torreira at Arsenal, Agbonlahor said on Stadium Astro: “Yeah, he [Ndidi] would suit. “With the way he’s been playing for Leicester, I think he’s got the legs. “He can move the ball forward and win the ball back.” He added: “But Leicester are doing better than them, so they won’t sell. “Despite this, he would definitely want a move to Arsenal with their history.” Ndidi has been impressive for Brendan Rodgers’ side so far this season. He has played 24 matches and scored two goals in all competitions for the Foxes this term.

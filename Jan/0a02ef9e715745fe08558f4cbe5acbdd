Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has provided the latest update on his squad ahead of the Red Devils’ Premier League clash with Burnley on Wednesday night at Old Trafford. Solskjaer’s men head to the game following a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool over the weekend. “I don’t think there were any other knocks in that game [last weekend] so we should have the same players to be available against Burnley,” Solskjaer told MUTV on Tuesday. “Which is positive. ”Of course, we are stretched and some of the players have played a lot. And they’re improving for it and will reap the benefits and get stronger physically and mentally more robust. “Of course, it’s great having Eric [Bailly], Diogo [Dalot] and Luke [Shaw] back in so we have more choices. “It’s a blow Marcus [Rashford] being out but that’s football. It’s part and parcel of it. He’s been fantastic all season for us and now, unfortunately, we have to do without him.” The kick-off time for the match is 9:15 pm.

Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, has charged troops of Operation Lafiya Dole (OPLD) to continue their onslaught against Boko Haram and ISWAP until they are completely subdued. The United Nations (UN) recently raised alarm over insurgents’ increasing attacks. Buratai, while addressing troops of 156 Task Force Battalion deployed to Mainok village in Kaga Local Government Area of Borno on Monday, commended the troops for the recent feat which had resulted in neutralising and capturing terrorists. Buratai added that the annihilation of the terrorists and recovery of gun trucks and weapons from them on Sunday in the area was a boost to the ongoing counterinsurgency campaign. “You have done and you are still doing your job professionally and this must be maintained”, NAN quoted him as saying. “We have a lot of individuals, a lot goodwill as well from across the country and a lot of distractions as well but these distractions must not hinder your operations. We have a sacred responsibility to our country. “The military profession, the profession of arm is a noble profession and you are the only ones that can do this Job because you have signed to sacrifice your comfort, your time and if need be, pay the supreme price. “You must remain focused, you must remain firm, you must maintain the determination to bring this madness by criminal elements of Boko Haram or whatever they call themselves to an end. “On this note, I must congratulate you on the feat you have done yesterday and you must continue to clear their doubt and deal with them decisively,” he said. Buratai also reassured the troops of improved welfare package in 2020, as well as those of their families in their various barracks, urging them to be proud of serving their country.

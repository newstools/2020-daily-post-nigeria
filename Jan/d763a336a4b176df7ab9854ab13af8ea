Leicester City on Saturday edged into the FA Cup fifth round as striker, Kelechi Iheanacho’s early goal sealed a 1-0 win against Brentford in the fourth round tie. Iheanacho scored the only goal of the game in the 4 minutes at Griffin Park. The former Manchester City star met James Justin’s cross with a clinical close-range finish. The Nigerian international has now scored seven goals in twelve appearances for Leicester so far this season. Leicester, who have never won the FA Cup, are hoping to reach the final for the first time since 1969. Iheanacho will now hope to lead Leicester City to victory when they take on Aston Villa on Tuesday in the Premier League.

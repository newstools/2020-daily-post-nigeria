Amotekun (or The South West Security Network), has since commenced operations in all the six states in Yourubaland A communiqué signed by Adams stated that contrary to fears in certain quarters, the outfit will complement the security architecture of the region and the nation at large. The council said the sole aim was to secure lives and property of the people following several attack by kidnappers, robbers, among other outlaws. It dispelled insinuation that the outfit is a military wing of the Oodua Peoples Congress, OPC, declaring that the long history of OPC vis-à-vis its contribution to regional security is not in doubt. The organization, the communiqué further stressed, “will leverage on its rich experience, to support any initiative that will help secure Yorubaland and make it a no-go area to career criminals and their tribes”. “The Are Onakakanfo-in-Council has the mandate to promote and preserve Yoruba tradition, culture, and heritage and will continue to do that. “The body, from time to time, will appraise matters affecting the Yoruba race and take definite stand in the best interest of the Yoruba, both at home and in the diaspora.” Reactions have continued to trail Amotekun launched on January 9, 2019.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho has refused to blame the club for playmaker, Christian Eriksen’s delay transfer move to Inter Milan. Eriksen, who was left out of Tottenham’s FA Cup fourth round 1-1 draw against Southampton on Saturday, has agreed on a personal term with Inter Milan to join Antonio Conte’s men in this January’s transfer window. The Denmark international is close to sealing a £16.8m move to the Serie A giants which could see him earn up to £320,000 per week. “You can read what you want to read. I don’t want to say anything,” Mourinho said as quoted by Sky Sport on Saturday. “I just want to say that this situation shouldn’t happen on the 25th of January, and that it is not Tottenham’s fault that on the 25th of January, we are in this situation. “The only thing I can say is, Eriksen, since I arrived, has behaved in a very, very professional way with me and with the team. “Tottenham is the last one to blame in this situation but to be on the 25th of January in a situation like this is not nice.”

President Muhammadu Buhari has commended Sen. Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the Supreme Court ruling declaring him the winner of the 2019 governorship election in the State. DAILY POST had reported that the Supreme Court in a unanimous judgment on Tuesday sacked Emeka Ihedioha as Governor of the State and declared Hope Uzodinma winner. It ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to withdraw the certificate of return from former Governor, Emeka Ihedioha and issue Uzodinma certificate of return as governor of the state. Delivering the judgment, Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun said the votes due to Uzodinma and APC from 318 polling units were wrongly excluded and should be added. Reacting, Buhari commended the Supreme Court for the ‘courage and perseverance’ to return Sen. Hope Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) winner of the March 9, 2019 governorship election in Imo.
Buhari said: “The road to justice may be long and tortuous, but it is the best path for anyone aggrieved. “Under the new administration, a new journey to build a new Imo with new energy is about to begin. In this outcome, it is the people of Imo State who have emerged victorious,”NAN quoted him as saying.
He, therefore, urged Uzodinma to promote the ideals of the APC and unite the state by running an inclusive administration.

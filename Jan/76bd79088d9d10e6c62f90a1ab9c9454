Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, says midfielder, Ross Barkley and winger, Willian would not be leaving Stamford Bridge in this January transfer window for another clubs. According to Lampard, he has a lot of belief in Barkley, while Willian is still in talks with the club in a bid to extend his contract. The Chelsea legend said this at his pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of the Blues’ Premier League clash with Newcastle United on Saturday. “There is no talk here of Barkley going anywhere, I have a lot of belief in Ross. Oli, he is experienced and if circumstances fall right it might happen,” Lampard said as quoted by Football London. “Willian is going nowhere. He is still in talks with the club.” He added: “There is nothing imminent. There are people waiting in the wings. I won’t talk about individuals. There is nothing imminent. “What remains the same is that the window is open and I am aware of how I want the squad to be. That is the focus on tomorrow [against Newcastle]. It has to be right in January.”

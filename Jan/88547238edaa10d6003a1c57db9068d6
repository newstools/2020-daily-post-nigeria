The United States of America has sent nearly 3,000 more Army troops to the Middle East on Saturday as reinforcements. This is following the crisis emanating from the killing of an Iranian general in a strike ordered by President Donald Trump early Friday morning. The killing of Maj.-Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, by a US airstrike on his convoy at Baghdad airport on Friday is at the moment creating a heavy tension in the Middle East. There are also fears of another World War. The airstrike, which was an from US President Donald Trump, has since generated a lot of controversies and reactions from world leaders.
Daily Mail, UK, reports that Defense officials announced the decision that was not yet announced by the Pentagon, and added that the troops are from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. They are in addition to about 700 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne who deployed to Kuwait earlier this week after the storming of the US Embassy compound in Baghdad by Iran-backed militiamen and their supporters. The additional troop deployments reflect concerns about potential Iranian retaliatory action. But they also run counter to Trump’s repeated push to extract the United States from Mideast conflicts.

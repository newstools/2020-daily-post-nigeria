A Chief Magistrates’ Court in Kaduna on Wednesday ordered that a 34-year-old businessman, Yakubu Aminu, who allegedly kidnapped a five-year-old boy be remanded in a correctional facility pending legal advice. Magistrate Umar Ibrahim, did not take the plea of Aminu, on grounds that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter, NAN reports. Ibrahim, ordered the police to forward the case file to the Department of Public Prosecution for advice. He adjourned the matter to Feb. 12 for hearing. The police charged Aminu, who resides at Shanono Rigasa Kaduna State with criminal conspiracy and kidnapping, contrary to sections 59 and 258 of the Kaduna State Penal Code Law . The Prosecution Counsel, Insp. Chidi Leo, told the court that the complainant, Kabiru Mohammed, who lives at Rigasa Kaduna reported the matter at the police station on Jan. 11. Leo alleged that on Jan. 10, at about 4p.m., the defendant abducted the complainant’s five-year-old son who was sent by his mother to buy some soup ingredients around the neighbourhood. The prosecutor said, on Jan. 11, the complainant received a phone call from a person demanding ransom of N500,000 before his son can be released. Leo further stated that the complainant was able to negotiate with the ”unknown caller” and was able to pay N150,000 but his son was not released. The prosecutor added that during the police investigation, the number used in calling the complainant was traced to the defendant and he was arrested while his accomplices ran away.

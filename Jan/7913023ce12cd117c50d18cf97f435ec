Lagos State on Friday recorded three incidents that required urgent attention of emergency services. Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, the Director General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) confirmed the collapse of a two-storey building at Agarawu, Palm Church, behind Lagos Central Mosque. Oke-Osanyintolu told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the building collapsed as a result of lack of maintenance and structural instability. “However, there was no loss of life or injury sustained in the incidence. “The LASEMA Response Team (LRT), Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA), Lagos State Neighborhood Corps (LNSC), Police and Lagos State Ambulance (LASAMBUS) were responders at the scene of incident,” he said. He said that recovery operation had taken place to ensure safety of lives and property in the area. The second was a fire outbreak which occurred in a storey building situated at 22, AIT road kola bus stop Alagbado. Oke-Osanyintolu said that when the LASEMA team arrived the scene of incident, it discovered that a storey building consisting of four flats of three bedroom each, was gutted by fire. “Further investigation revealed that the cause of the fire was due to electrical surge which emanated from the ceiling fan in the living room and which escalated to other rooms in the affected flat. “Fortunately no loss of life or injuries was recorded at the incident. “The fire was curtailed and finally put out by the combined efforts of the Agency’s LRT (Dolphin Squad) and Men of Lagos State Fire Service Operations,” he said.

Manchester City have beat off Barcelona’s offer for Coritiba full-back Yan Couto. The English side are now ahead of La Liga giants in the race for the 17-year-old, according to Yahoo Esportes. The Brazilian sports outlet reports that City have submitted an offer that could reach €15 million, a purchase offer of €9 million plus potential add-ons of €6 million. It further claimed that a deal is just awaiting a medical before the transfer can become official. The 17-year-old, however would not make the switch to England until June with the club having to wait until after his 18th birthday in early June. Barcelona had offered a figure in the region of €10 million – €5 million below that of Manchester City. Despite being just 17-years-old, Yan Couto has already been compared to Barcelona legend, Dani Alves following impressive performances for the Brazilian national side at U17 level. The LaLiga champions were believed to have won the race to sign the youngster earlier this month, but reports on Thursday morning suggest that this is far from the case.

The Chief Magistrate, Patricia Igho-Braimoh sentenced the suspect to five years on two counts of no lawful title to landed property and without the consent of the owner to do so. The convict was given an option of fine to pay N2million for the two count charges. According to the prosecution, the convict committed the offence between April 2016, and May, 2017. Earlier, the state counsel, Mr Emmanuel Akhimie told the court that the convict’s father earlier sold the piece of land, measuring 100ft by 200ft Lying and situated at Ugbor Village Road, GRA , Benin to Mr Victor Esiegbe.

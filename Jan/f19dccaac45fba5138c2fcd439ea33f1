Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Wednesday became the only manager in English football to beat Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City twice at the Etihad following his side’s 1-0 victory over the Premier League champions in the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg encounter. Recall that Solskjaer had defeated Guardiola’s side 2-1 in the Premier League at Etihad last December. The Norwegian also said the decision of the referee to send off midfielder, Nemanja Matic in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup win over Man City at the Etihad Stadium was an ‘absolute joke’. Matic, who scored the only goal of the encounter, was shown a yellow card for a foul on Riyad Mahrez before being given another for a foul on Ilkay Gundogan 14 minutes from time. “It’s hard to score with 11 here, never mind 10. Never a sending off of [Matic]. For me, an absolute joke,” Solskjaer told British media after the match. “It’s ironic really that he gets a yellow with his first foul, almost gets a yellow with his second foul, which isn’t even a foul. The last one is a yellow, but a red overall? Nowhere near. “They have given us absolutely everything these boys, I’m so incredibly proud,” he added. “Football is a game we should all enjoy, spectators and the ones playing,” he said. “We want rivalry but keep it at the same level. Let’s make sure we eradicate this now.”

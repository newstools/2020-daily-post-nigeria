A 44-year-old man, Amuda Ademola, on Friday, appeared before an Abeokuta Magistrates’ Court sitting in Isabo, for allegedly defrauding one Mr. Sanmi Awesu of N5 million on the pretext of selling cashew nuts to him.
The defendant, whose address was not provided, is standing trial on a three-count charge of conspiracy, fraud and stealing. However, the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge, NAN reports. The Prosecutor, Insp. Lawrence Olu-Balogun, told the court that the defendant committed the offences sometime in February 2019 on Quarry Road in Abeokuta. Olu-Balogun alleged that the defendant collected the N5 million from Awasu, converted it to his personal use and never supplied the cashew nuts. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened sections 516, 419, and 390 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun, 2006. The Magistrate, Mr Olakunleyin Oke, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N500,000 with two sureties in like sum. Oke ordered that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years’ tax payment to Ogun State Government. He adjourned the case until Jan. 21 for substantive hearing.

A mentally unstable woman has delivered a baby boy in Onitsha just few hours after she was rescued from the streets by Anambra State Commissioner for Women Affairs, Lady Ndidi Mezue
DAILY POST gathered that the pregnant woman was rescued after some good spirited individuals made distress calls to the commissioner over her condition. Sources said Mezue moved to Onitsha after the distress calls and rescued the woman. The source added that, “The Commissioner swung into action immediately and sought the assistance of the Women Development Officer (WDO) of Onitsha North Local Government Area who with a nurse took the woman to Onitsha General Hospital, where she was delivered of a bouncing baby boy. As at the time of filing this report, the woman was yet to be identified. Our source said, “She (mentally challenged woman) is still receiving bed rest. I am sure treatment on her will commence once she recovers after a good rest.” Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano, wife of the governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano has over the years been rescuing mentally sick people from the street for treatment. A home for the treatment of mentally challenged persons set up by her in Nteje, Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra State is known to have treated several sick persons for free of charge, after which they are reunited with their families.

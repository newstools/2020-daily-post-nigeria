The member representing Ikwo/ Ezza south Federal constituency, in the House of Representatives, Hon. Chinedu Ogah on Friday said the emergence of President Mohammadu Buhari, saved the nation from witnessing a total collapse. Ogah made this known while in a chart with journalists at his country home at Amagu ikwo community, Ikwo LGA of Ebonyi state. He noted that laying to rest of the rumoured third term agenda by the present administration was part of the effort of President Buhari to save the nation from total collapse. According to him: “We are privileged to be in the National Assembly and for us to perform very well, we need your supports. We need your advise. When ever you see me derailing, call my attention. “We need to know what is going on in this country. We are lucky to have someone like President Mohammadu Buhari. If not that God made it possible for us to have somebody like him ( Buhari), Nigeria would have collapsed. “This is the first time in Nigeria that the world bank reported Nigeria as one of the countries that has the best growing economy. And no country grows in this aspect. “They only grow in borrowing to develop the economy. You see that most of the borrowing Nigeria has done, was utilized judiciously to build railway. This railway will be a chain reaction to repay the loans. “You see so many other things that the Federal government has been able to do with the loans they have collected. With this, you found out that Nigeria is now getting it right. “You come to the aspect of empowerment, President Buhari has done well. And this empowerment will help to reduce insurgency and other heinous crimes being committed some youths in Nigeria” he stated.

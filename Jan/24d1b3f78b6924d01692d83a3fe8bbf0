The Yola Division of the Federal Court of Appeal has affirmed the judgment of the state High Court sentencing three men to death by hanging for armed robbery and culpable homicide. The Court of Appeal held that the state High Court acted in the interest of justice by sentencing the convicts to death by hanging, and upholds the penalty. The convicts, Rabiu Alhaji Wada, 25, Luka Umaru,35, and Hamisu Sani, 22, all from Adamawa State, were handed down the death sentence after pleading guilty to the three-count charge of conspiracy, armed robbery and culpable homicide. The three were convicted for conspiracy and armed robbery while armed with offensive weapons contrary to section 6(b) and punishable under section 1(2) (a) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special provisions) Act Cap R11 Laws of Nigeria. The convicts had earlier been arraigned before the state High Court presided by Hon. Justice Abdul-Aziz Waziri on the 23th February, 2017. The High Court had while delivering its judgment in suit number/ADYS/17c/2017/ on the 10th April, 2018, sentenced them to death by hanging for the offences. The court had specified that the convicts were to be hanged by the neck until a medical doctor certified them dead. The trio had chosen to appeal the verdict of the lower court, and filed their appeal on 6th July, 2018 on the grounds that the lower court erred in law when it convicted them solely on a confessional statement which they retracted. Delivering its judgment on the matter, the Court of Appeal, presided by Hon. Justice Chidi Nwaoma Uwa, dismissed the application and affirmed the judgment of the state High Court.

The Rector of The Polytechnic Ibadan, Professor Kazeem Adebiyi, on Friday declared that students’ union is not a vehicle to intimidate fellow students and members of the public. Adebiyi made this declaration while speaking during the swearing in ceremony of the Students’ Union executives and Students’ Representative Council held at the North Campus Assembly Hall of the institution. The Rector in his remarks, charged the newly elected Students’ Union Executives in the institution to eschew political vendetta, internal wrangling and destructive youthful exuberance, which can tarnish the image of the institution. He said, “It is imperative to note that Students’ Union is not a vehicle for intimidating members of the public and fellow students. “Under no circumstances must student leaders take laws Into their hands in the guise of “ALUTA” “Note that every member of the Student’s Union Executive and the Senate had signed a matriculation oath which must be abided with. “You are therefore subject to the authority of the Management and Board of Studies,”Professor Adebiyi further charged, urging them to also ensure that their academic programme does not suffer at the expense of engaging in Union activities.” He assured the students union executives that the management would always welcome constructive contributions to growth and development of the institution as partners in progress, but will not condone any act of lawlessness, gangsterism or dictation on the part of the students’ leaders. Adebiyi used the occasion to thank the State Government over what he described as tremendous assistance to the institution and promised the loyalty of members of staff as well as their devotion to duty. The newly elected President of the SU, Blessing Fadare, promised to mobilize the students to support the management efforts towards uplifting the institution. He equally promised a peaceful administration based on constructive approach to issues.

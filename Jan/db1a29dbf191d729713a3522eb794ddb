President of the United States of America, Donald Trump has issued a strong warning to Iran, threatening to hit 52 Iranian sites “very hard” if the Middle East country attacks Americans or United States assets. Tension has been on the rise following a US raid on Friday that killed head of the Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia leader. The American President took to Twitter to warn that his country had “targeted 52 Iranian sites.” He said some of the sites were “at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.” “The USA wants no more threats!” Trump said. Trump went on to explain that the 52 sites targeted represented the 52 Americans who were held hostage in Iran for 444 days after being seized at the US embassy in Tehran in November 1979. Several rockets were fired in and around Baghdad, the Iraqi capital last night, including inside the capital’s heavily-fortified Green Zone and the Balad airbase housing US troops but no casualties were reported in the rocket attacks.

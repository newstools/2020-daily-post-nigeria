The United States of America has said that it was aware that Iran will attack its major cities without warning. Iran had vowed that ‘harsh retaliation’ awaits the Americans following an airstrike in Iraq that killed a top Iranian general. The US fears that sleeper cells may be ready to attack in major cities. The killing of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, on Friday marks a major escalation in the standoff between the U.S. and Iran. There are fears that the Iran-backed Hezbollah militant group, which has been designated by the U.S. government as a foreign terrorist organization, may have sleeper cells in the U.S. that are ready to retaliate. Former CIA operations officer, Sam Faddis, warned that Hezbollah sleeper cells were hiding in the U.S. and potentially had targets in its sights. “It is more than possible that Hezbollah has sleeper cells in the United States ready to strike,’ Faddis told DailyMail.com. “Based on what we know we must assume they do and that they can hit targets on U.S. soil at anytime without warning.” Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had already warned that ‘harsh retaliation is waiting’ for America following the airstrikes.

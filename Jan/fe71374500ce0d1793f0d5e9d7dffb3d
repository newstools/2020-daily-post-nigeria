Bayern Munich manager, Hans-Dieter Flick has dismissed report linking his defender, David Alaba with a move to Chelsea. DAILY POST had reported that Chelsea are keen on a £60million move for Alaba. Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, is looking to strengthen the left side of his defence in the January transfer window and has been left unimpressed by his options in Emerson Palmieri and Marcos Alonso. Speaking on the development, Flick said as quoted by Metro UK: “Alaba is not for sale in the winter. “We are very well occupied with Alphonso Davies on the left. “Alaba is doing very well at centre-back at the moment. “He can lead a team, he showed that. These are the criteria the leader of the defence has to fulfil.”

Another set of missiles have been launched at US bases in Baghdad, Iraq on Tuesday. Katyusha rockets targeted the Taji military camp, located north of Baghdad, but no casualties were reported. The Iraqi base is housing a large number of US troops and other foreign forces, making it a target for Iran-backed armed groups. Iran, which vowed to retaliate the assassination of its army Chief, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, had previously launched several rocket attacks on US bases on two occasions. At least, two Katyusha rockets were fired, an army captain told Anadolu Agency on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media, Al Jazeera reports. On Sunday, four Iraqi soldiers were wounded after eight Katyusha rockets were fired at the Al Balad airbase.

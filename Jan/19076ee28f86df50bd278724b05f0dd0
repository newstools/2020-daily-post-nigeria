Chelsea Manager, Frank Lampard, has reportedly permitted the club’s board to sign Lyon forward, Moussa Dembele in this January transfer window. According to Sky Sports, Lampard, who has compared Dembele to Chelsea legend, Didier Drogba in private, has been keeping close tabs on the 23-year-old star. The newspaper reports that the Blues boss is keen to bolster his attacking options this January with Olivier Giroud set to leave Stamford Bridge and Michy Batshuayi still struggling with game time. Lampard recently admitted that Chelsea need to sign a new creative forward following the departure of Eden Hazard to Real Madrid. He said: “There will be discussions about where we can strengthen. “The transfer window will be a bit fluid. “It is quite clear in the summer we lost Eden Hazard who has been a huge part of scoring and creating for us in the last few seasons. We need more competition in those creative areas.” Dembele has been impressive for Lyon since he joined the club from Celtic last year. He has scored 29 goals in 62 appearances in all competitions for the Ligue 1 side. Dembele has also drawn interest from both Manchester United and Arsenal in recent weeks.

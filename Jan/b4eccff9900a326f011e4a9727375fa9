Former Liverpool stars, Michael Owen and Mark Lawrenson have predicted tonight’s Premier League clash between Chelsea and Arsenal at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea head to the game following a 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United last weekend, while Arsenal played a 1-1 draw with Sheffield United. Providing his prediction, Owen was quoted by Sport Review as saying: “Chelsea came from behind to win the reverse fixture at the Emirates over the Festive period, and I think the Blues will bounce back from their defeat at Newcastle on Saturday evening when they had plenty of possession and enough opportunities to have come away with all three points. “Arsenal are 10 points away from a Champions League spot and they have drawn 11 of their league games so far this term. “I feel Mikel Arteta would take a share of the spoils at Stamford Bridge, but I think the Blues will edge a tight, possibly feisty London derby.” Also providing his prediction, Lawrenson said: “Arsenal are not shipping as many goals but I still think they are pretty ordinary at the back. “Chelsea punished them with two late goals at Emirates Stadium a few weeks ago and I am expecting a similar story this time too. “Frank Lampard’s side have struggled at home against less glamorous opposition, but they are going to be up for this one.” The kick-off time for the match is 9:15pm.

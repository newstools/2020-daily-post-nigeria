Bauchi state chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has lauded the supreme court judges ‘for ensuring that justice prevailed in their verdict’ by upholding the election of governor Bala Mohammed. State publicity secretary of the party Yayanuwa Zainabari while reacting to the court’s judgement in a phone interview with DAILY POST said the development would encourage Mohammed to focus more on delivering good governance to the people of the state. He said for the past couple of months, the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC) dragged the governor into ‘ unnecessary legal tussles at tribunal, court of appeal and the supreme court just to distract him’. According to him, the governor had immediately after assuming office refused to be distracted by the political rivals but swung into action and initiated several development projects including roads construction and came up with many programs in the health, education and agricultural sectors. He thanked the people of the state for their support and fervent prayers which helped the governor emerge victorious in the three courts. Zainabari however appealed to the opposition to sheath their swords’ now that the legal battle is over, cooperate with the government and proffer advice that would move the state forward.

Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, on Thursday night, made history in his side’s Copa del Rey 5-0 victory over Leganés. Barcelona defeated Leganés at the Camp Nou to qualify for the quarter-finals of the competition, thanks to goals from Antoine Griezmann (1), Clement Lenglet (1), Lionel Messi (2) and Arthur Melo (1). Messi’s brace against Leganés means the Argentine captain has now reach 500 wins as an FC Barcelona player as reported by Barcelona’s official website on Thursday. The 32-year-old sits at the head of the ranking of wins, ahead of second placed Xavi Hernández (476) and Andrés Iniesta (459). Messi claimed his first win as a Barça player against Espanyol on 16 October 2004. Only one team has managed to avoid defeat against Messi – UDA Gramanet who won 1-0 in the Copa del Rey in 2004/05 in their only clash with the Barça number 10.

The senator representing Niger East, Senator Mohammed Sani Musa, on Saturday, raised the alarm over coordinated attacks on people of Shiroro Local Government Area of the state. Musa disclosed that the local government came under heavy attacks this morning with armed bandits in numbers invaded the villages of Kudodo, Galapai, Dnakpala, Makera and Dnalagwa killing scores, raping and abducting people. In a statement by his Media Office, the lawmaker claimed that adjoining villages like Amale, Tunga and Adunu were not spared, as the bandits left on their heels more deaths, destruction and abduction. Musa, who earlier this week cried out to President Muhammadu Buhari over the spate of increasing killings by bandits in his constituency said the situation in his constituency was helpless as the bandits wreak unimaginable havoc on the people with no security succour insight. The terse statement reads: ‘My people are under siege, innocent families have been displaced, killed, raped, kidnapped and community members straddled in a state of despair. As the attacks continued more villagers in my constituency are awaiting their fate as no sign of succour comes their way. “It is confirmed that the bandits are attacking all through the night to this afternoon and most communities are in grave danger. For months now, most local governments in Niger East have been under the menacing grip of bandits with no succour insight. “We are again calling on Mr President and all the security Chiefs to come to our aid without further delay as the people risk continued attacks from these ungodly killers.” The senator also called on the National Emergency Management Agency and other relevant authorities to respond to the plight of his people who are helplessly in state of fear and despair.

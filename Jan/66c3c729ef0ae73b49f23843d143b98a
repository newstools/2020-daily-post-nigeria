Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham has revealed words from manager Frank Lampard after their 1-0 loss to Newcastle on Saturday. The English gaffer was left frustrated by the defeat and called on his players to take their anger out on Arsenal in the Premier League on Tuesday night. Newcastle’s 94th minute goal from Isaac Hayden gave all three points for Steve Bruce’s side and leave them with nothing from their trip to St James’ Park. Abraham, who was also frustrated by the outcome of the match, said that Lampard has already turned the attention of the squad to take on Arsenal. “The gaffer [Lampard] said after the game ‘We gave it our all, keep your heads up we’ve got another massive game on Tuesday’ and we just have to take our anger out against Arsenal. “It’s a tough one to take,” the England international added. “These are the kind of games you watch on TV and you never expect it to happen to you. “We dominated the game, in the second half I don’t remember them having a shot until the last minute and they score. “For us, we have to give credit to Newcastle, they defended well all game, they disrupted our style of play, but we gave it our all and were unfortunate to lose at the end.” Chelsea and Arsenal clash at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday evening.

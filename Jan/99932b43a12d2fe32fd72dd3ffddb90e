Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has claimed that playmaker, Christian Eriksen is not performing at his highest level for the club. Mourinho said this ahead of his side’s FA Cup clash against Middlesbrough on Tuesday night. DAILY POST had reported that Eriksen continues to eye the Spurs exit door, with his contract expiring next summer. The Denmark international was keen to join Real Madrid last summer, but the Los Blancos manager, Zinedine Zidane was only interested in adding Manchester United star, Paul Pogba to his midfield.  He has recently drawn interest from Manchester United and Inter Milan. But Mourinho believes now that he has been in football for many years to know when a player in Erisken’s position is not giving his all for the club, adding that he is ‘not an idiot’. “If you ask me if this is the best Christian Eriksen, I have to be honest and say no,” Mourinho said as quoted by Daily Mail on Monday. “I’m not an idiot, I’ve been in football for many years. A player who is in this position, it’s normal that a player in this situation doesn’t perform at the highest level.” He added: “He plays tomorrow. After that I have a match on Saturday and he maybe plays on Saturday again. “I cannot tell you much more than that.”

Saudi Arabian Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir, has condemned Wednesday’s missile attacks by Iran on US bases. Qassem Soleimani, who was the Commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, was killed in a US airstrike on his convoy at Baghdad airport last week rising the tension of another World War. The airstrike, which was an order from US President Donald Trump, has since generated a lot of controversies and reactions from world leaders. On Wednesday, Iran retaliated by launching over 15 missiles on US targets in Iraq. “We take issue with the violation of Iraq’s sovereignty by Iran,” al-Jubeir said on Friday during a news conference in Prague where he was on a routine diplomatic visit. He reiterated his country’s position, supporting the US’s right to defend itself but called for calm in the region. “We believe that there should be a way to avoid escalation because we believe escalation would be damaging to all parties and not just one or the other,” he added.

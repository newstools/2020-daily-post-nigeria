The Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Justice Reforms, Mrs Juliet Ibekaku-Nwagwu, says President Muhammadu Buhari has strengthened the justice sector. Ibekaku-Nwagwu disclosed this on Saturday in Enugu shortly after she was conferred with a chieftaincy title by Igwe Onyioha Nwanjoku, the traditional ruler of Ohafia Ndumeze in the Aninri Local Government Area. NAN reports that the presidential aide said that a whole lot of reforms had been made to ensure that Nigerians had access to justice. “What we do in the justice sector has been challenging in terms of ensuring that Nigerians can go to the courts and get justice,” she said. Ibekaku-Nwagwu said that the sector was also strategic in making policies that would ensure the recovery of looted funds and making sure that the same was used to change the lives of Nigerians. She said that the president had shown unprecedented commitment in transforming the fortunes of the less privileged by approving such policies. On the infrastructural needs of the Southeast, the presidential aide said that the zone had not had it so good. “The president has shown uncommon zeal in building infrastructure in the zone which includes the pursuit of the completion of the Second Niger Bridge which is a signature project in the zone. “The investment being made in the agricultural sector is very relevant to the agrarian communities in the state. The president is consolidating on what he did in his first term. “By the time he finishes the work he is doing, our people will see the difference,” Ibekaku-Nwagwu said. However, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has vowed to continue to protect and defend the nation’s democracy and its institutions. The party, on Friday, resolved to go on street protest over alleged miscarriage of justice by the Supreme Court that sacked former Governor of Imo state, Emeka Ihedioha.

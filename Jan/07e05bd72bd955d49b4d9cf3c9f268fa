Goals from Uche Onosonya in the first half, another from Mustapha Ibrahim and a brace by Abba Umar in the second half ensured that the Lalong Boys remained at the summit of the NPFL after week 12 games. The game started with both teams making incursions into each others area. In the 26th minute, a build up into the Enyimba area almost resulted to a goal, as a Plateau United attacker found a team made in the 18 yard box only for the shot to be parried for a corner kick by the Enyimba goalkeeper. Also, in the 39th minute, a defensive blunder by a Plateau United defender gave a free Enyimba attacker the chance but his effort was easily stopped by the Plateau United shot stopper. However, the first goal of the game came through Uche Onosonya in the 40th minute with a header. Later in the second half, Mustapha Ibrahim, a former Enyimba player and member of Super Eagles B team scored against his former club via a blistering header in the second half. The third goal of the match was scored by Abba Umr after a careless mistake by the Enyimba players in the 18 yard box.

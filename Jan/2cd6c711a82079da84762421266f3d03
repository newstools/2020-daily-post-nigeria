Former head coach of the Super Eagles, Sunday Oliseh, has praised Mikel Arteta for his timely tactical decisions, that helped Arsenal claim a 2-2 draw against Chelsea on Tuesday. The Gunners were a man down before the half-hour mark, after David Luiz was sent off. Jorginho made it 1-0 from the penalty spot before Gabriel Martinelli ran through to equalize. Arsenal captain, Hector Bellerin, equalised three minutes after opposing captain Cesar Azpilicueta thought he had claimed a victory for the Blues. Oliseh pointed to Arteta’s decision to take Mesut Ozil and keep Martinelli, as key in the result. “Remarkable coaching work by Mikel Arteta tonight vs Chelsea, 2-2! “With one man sent off, away from home, changes players’ animation, exit of Ozil at the right moment and keeping Martinelli on are some of the highlights of his coaching prowess, in my opinion! Very Entertaining,” Oliseh tweeted.

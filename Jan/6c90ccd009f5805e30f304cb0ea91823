Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has revealed that the club’s major problem under their manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this season is ‘inconsistency’. Ferdinand said this following Man United’s goalless draw against Wolves in the FA Cup third-round encounter on Saturday. “It was a better second half but both teams lacked quality in the final third especially,’ Ferdinand told BT Sport. “They huffed and puffed until they got to the final third, there wasn’t any quality into the box or into either frontman for us [Man Utd] to see a bit of magic. “You never came off your seat once in the whole game.” Ferdinand added: “Not super clearly yet where United are going under Solskjaer. “I still think it’s a work in progress, the problem has been the inconsistency. “Recently they’ve beaten Spurs and [Manchester] City and you think they are on the right path, we can see it, they are moving forward. “Then they go and put in a performance like they did against Arsenal and it was disheartening seeing that game. “But I think with the young players and the players he’s got out, the inconsistency is not understandable but you can understand where it’s coming from.”

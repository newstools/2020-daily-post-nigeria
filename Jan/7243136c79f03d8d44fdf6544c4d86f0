Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that his side will be without three key players when they take on Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge due to injuries. Chelsea head to the game following a 1-1 draw against Brighton in their last Premier League encounter. “Christian is out for a few weeks,” was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying in his pre-match press conference on Friday. “He was injured in training last Saturday before Nottingham Forest. It’s a tendon injury in the adductor so we’ll have to see how quickly he recovers because it’s quite a nasty injury and he was in pain when it happened. “Marcos Alonso is recovering. He trained today but he won’t be ready for tomorrow. “Ruben [Loftus-Cheek] is still out and he’s out for a while but hopefully, he’ll start getting involved in a bit of collective football, maybe with the Academy to get his eye in slightly in terms of playing because he’s at that stage now.” The kick-off time for the match is 4 pm.

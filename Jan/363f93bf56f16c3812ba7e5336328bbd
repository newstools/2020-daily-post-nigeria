The Ndigbo Unity Forum (NUF), a pan-Igbo socio-political group, has urged residents of Imo State to accept the Supreme Court judgment, which declared Sen. Hope Uzodinma as the governor of the state in good faith. The President of NUF, Mr Augustine Chukwudum, told NAN on Wednesday that the judgment was a divine verdict “that must not be questioned by any human being. “NUF calls on Imo State people to accept the judgment of the Supreme Court which declared Sen. Hope Uzodinma winner of the 2019 governorship election in good faith. “Imo state has been in bondage for the past 20 years. “We hereby call on Imo people to support Uzodinma to deliver democracy dividend which has eluded them for the past 20 years,’’ he said. The NUF boss, however, said that “it is time for Ndigbo to embrace All Progressives Congress (APC)’’. “The President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government has done well for Ndigbo; that is why we must commend and embrace APC as our political party,’’ he said. Chukwudum congratulated Uzodinma for working very hard to reclaim his mandate, “Imo people must rejoice because a saviour has come.’’ DAILY POST recalls that the Supreme Court on Tuesday sacked Chief Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the governor of the state and declared Uzodinma winner of the March 9, 2019 gubernatorial election. The judgement has since stirred diverse reactions from well-meaning Nigerians.

Governor Aminu Masari has signed the sum of N244bn, 2020 appropriation bill into law. Shortly after signing the appropriation bill, governor Masari assured the completion of all ongoing projects across the state.
Governor Masari had in November last year proposed the sum of N249bn for its 2020 fiscal year but the House of Assembly slashed it to N244bn. Governor Masari promised to revamp the department of special duties and that of budget and planning through town hall meetings for people to understand the purpose of budget to allow full participation. Governor Masari explained, “We will start this in the 3rd quarter of this year at the Senatorial level. We shall break into various constituencies to have more inputs. This allows locals to have inputs of what they want to be captured. “We will try to make the finances of government public to drive revenue generation.”
Governor Masari added, “The needs of people are simple, but because they are not involved, we make decisions without consultation, this leads us to not finding it well. This open door policy will reduce a lot of pressure and enhance government accountability to the public.

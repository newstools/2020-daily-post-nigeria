Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said Liverpool are not the greatest team in Premier League history. Liverpool are on track for their first league title since 1990, holding a 13-point lead with two games in hand. One of those matches will be against United at Anfield on Sunday. Solskjaer, who won six Premier League trophies and the Champions League as a player under legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson, however, insists longevity is the key to greatness. “If you are taking the long view, the very best teams are the ones who can do it again and again and again. “No one really matches Sir Alex in that respect but I would be the first to admit Jurgen Klopp has done a great job at Liverpool. “At the moment he seems to know what he’s going to get every time he puts a team out, though we are only just past halfway through the season and there are still a lot of games to go. “If you look at Liverpool now, they have 33 wins and five draws from their last 38 [league] games. That’s 104 points, so it would have been a more than decent season. “They are doing well, to say the least, and could win a treble this season but let’s see where they are in May. They have a couple of difficult games coming up,” Solskjaer told reporters ahead of the clash. United are fifth, five points behind fourth-placed Chelsea and 27 points adrift of Liverpool.

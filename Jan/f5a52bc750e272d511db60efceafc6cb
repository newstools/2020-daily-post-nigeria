Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has dismissed speculation claiming that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has agreed to join Barcelona. Earlier this week, reports in Spain claimed that Aubameyang has already told Barca that he would be willing to join them. The 30-year-old will have just one year left on his contract at the end of the season. But Arteta is adamant that Aubameyang is happy at Arsenal and the striker is not looking to leave. “As far as I know, I think a week ago, we were discussing that he said he was so happy, that he didn’t agree with the things that were being written in the media, that he has his future here. “I’m so happy with that so that’s where I’m standing at the moment,” Arteta said during his Friday press conference.

Former Barcelona star, Rivaldo, has urged the club to make a transfer move for Paris Saint-Germain striker, Edinson Cavani. The Brazilian legend believes Cavani would be a ‘magnificent improvement’ for Barca’s attack following striker, Luis Suarez’s injury. DAILY POST had reported that Suarez is set to be out of action for around four months after undergoing knee surgery. “Cavani would be a magnificent improvement for Barcelona’s attack now that Suarez is out for quite some time,” Rivaldo was quoted by Goal as saying. “After all, Cavani is a top forward who has always got his goals in Europe’s top leagues. In his case it seems he’s really close to leaving PSG and it would be a very good opportunity.” DAILY POST had reported that Cavani has drawn interest from Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Atletico Madrid in recent weeks. The 32-year-old Uruguay international has started just four games in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, having lost his place to Mauro Icardi who is on loan from Inter Milan. His current contract with the Parisians is set to expire at the end of the season, when he will be available on a free transfer.

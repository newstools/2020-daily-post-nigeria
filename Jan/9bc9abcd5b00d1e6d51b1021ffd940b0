The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has announced the temporary closure of Port Harcourt International Airport runway. This follows bush burning near the airport. Flights were prevented from landing and taking off from the airport before FAAN closed the facility temporarily on Saturday night. Henrietta Yakubu, General Manager, corporate affairs, FAAN, made the announcement in a statement issued in Lagos on Saturday. Yakubu explained that the temporary closure of the runway was part of safety precautions. The statement reads in part: “A joint team from the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria and the Nigeria Airspace Management Agency is presently evaluating the situation. “This is with a view to ensuring that the airside is cleared of smoke and restoration of normalcy at the airport. “Henrietta assured Nigerians that FAAN was committed to its core values of safety, security and comfort of passengers and airport users.”

President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with justices of the Supreme Court of Nigeria and National Judicial Council over the death of Justice Abubakar Bashir Wali, one of the pioneer legal practitioners from Northern Nigeria. A statement by the president’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Tuesday, said the President joined Kano Emirate Council, family members, close associates and professional colleagues in mourning Justice Wali. Late Wali was the first Judge of Shari’ah Court of Appeal from the North, after rising through the ranks, and later reaching the peak as Justice of the Supreme Court. President Buhari affirmed the worthy contributions of Justice Wali to the development of the country, starting out early in 1945 after his primary school education, and ensuring delivery of sound judgment on landmark cases that had since become references in Nigeria’s judiciary. The President prayed that the almighty God would accept the soul of the departed, and comfort his family.

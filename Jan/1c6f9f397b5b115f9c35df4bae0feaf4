Reports reaching DAILY POST in Maiduguri, the Borno State capital, reveal that soldiers have arrested Daily Trust Reporter, Mr. Omirin Olatunji. He was picked up at the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, secretariat. According to some journalists who were present at the time of the arrest, two plain cloth army personnel and a soldier in army uniform, with assault rifle came into the NUJ Press Centre and handcuffed the journalist. “He was dragged into a waiting Ford Focus light blue car at about 4:40pm. “We later learnt that he was taken to 7 Division of the Nigeria Army along Pompomari bypass,” an eyewitness said. There is feeling that the arrest may not be unconnected with the report the journalist filed on the alleged attack on travellers along the Maiduguri-Damaturu road yesterday.

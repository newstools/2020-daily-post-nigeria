Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has declared himself a member of both the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and the All Progressives Congress, APC. Umahi, who stated this while berating PDP members planning to defect to the APC said he is also “100 per cent APC.”
Speaking at the state Government House while receiving people of Ishielu and Onicha Local Government Areas over the weekend, Umahi urged members to stop “jumping from here and there” because they might be caught in anti-party activities. He said: “Stay in one place. Don’t run from here to there and from there to here. E no make sense. If you say you dey there (APC), know I am already there. If you go to APC, I am an APC member. If you go to PDP, I am there. “I am the only person that does anti-party and nothing will happen. Any other person that does anti-party is gone. So, I am representing you in APC while you all stay in PDP. If you like, go and write it on social media.” The governor also disclosed that he sent handsome Yuletide gifts to the ruling party’s leaders. Umahi commended President Muhammadu Buhari administration for making Ebonyi the only state in the Southeast to be listed among the states to have a new Federal College of Education. He told the people of Ishielu local government that the college would not be located in their zone. He, however, promised them a technical school.

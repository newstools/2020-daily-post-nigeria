Edinson Cavani’s mother, Berta, has admitted her son has his heart set on a move to Atletico Madrid. The Uruguayan striker is determined to leave Ligue 1 this January and is attracting attention from Premier League sides like Manchester United and Chelsea. However, Berta has accused PSG of “not behaving well” on the 32-year-old’s future. She told Spanish newspaper AS: “There is an open negotiation. PSG have rejected three proposals from Atletico but my son has asked to leave and we are waiting for an agreement to be reached by both clubs. “It’s complicated but he wants to play at Atletico, if not now, then in the summer. We have been wishing it for years but it does not now depend on my son but on PSG and Atletico. “They are not behaving well with him, [especially] with everything he has given to PSG in the near seven years he has been there.” “If you don’t use him, let him go to a club that needs your goals like Atletico Madrid.”

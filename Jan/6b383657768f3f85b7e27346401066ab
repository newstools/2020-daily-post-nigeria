Ondo State Epidemiologist, Dr Steven Fagbemi, said on Tuesday that lassa fever has so far claimed at least 16 lives in the state since its outbreak in early January. NAN reports that Fagbemi said this in Akure during a meeting between Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu and major stakeholders, including the local government chairmen in Ondo North and Ondo Central Senatorial Districts on how to contain the spread of the disease in the state. He said that the state had recorded 84 cases of the disease from January 1 to date. According to him, 16 of the patients died because their cases had reached advanced stage before they were taken to hospital. He also disclosed that 47 patients currently on admission were responding to treatment, while 21 persons had been treated and discharged. Akeredolu, therefore, directed local government chairmen in the two senatorial districts to ensure a clean environment in their areas in order to check the spread of the dreaded disease. He charged them to ensure that markets and their surroundings in the area were kept clean to forestall an epidemic of the scourge. The governor also advised the chairmen to deploy street sweepers to market places, while urging residents to wash their hands regularly to avert the spread of the disease. He further advised that cases of persistent fever should be taken to hospital, while the chairman should embark on massive evacuation of dumping sites. In Kano, Lassa Fever has claimed the lives of two doctors and a pregnant woman.

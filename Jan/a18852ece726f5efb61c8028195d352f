The Nigerian Governors Forum, has resolved to address the lingering issue of Right of Way, RoW, charges in a bid to deepen broadband penetration in the country and promote a Digital Economy for a Digital Nigeria. The resolution followed a presentation made by Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, during a meeting of the forum held yesterday, and was contained in a statement by Femi Adeluyi, Technical Assistant, Information Technology, to the Minister. During the meeting, Pantami highlighted the many benefits that an increase in broadband access can have on the economy of the various states. He stated that one of the key benefits was the rapid growth in the Gross Domestic Product, GDP, of any country that increases its broadband penetration. Pantami urged the state Governors to adopt the 2013 resolutions reached by the National Economic Council (NEC), which agreed on a maximum RoW charge of N145.00 per linear meter of fibre. Responding, the governors acknowledged the benefits of broadband penetration in Nigeria. Chairman of the Governorsâ€™ Forum, Kayode Fayemi stated that there will no longer be any need to appeal to the Governors on the issue of RoW.

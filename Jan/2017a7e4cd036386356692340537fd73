Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solksjaer, will be without Marcus Rashford, when they take on Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. Rashford was missing from the travelling party, having picked up a back problem against Wolves in the FA Cup earlier in the week. Solskjaer has however been given a defensive boost though, with the return of Eric Bailly to the matchday squad. Bailly last played for United on their pre-season tour, but made a comeback from a knee injury for the Under-23s a week last Friday. Solskjaer said returning defenders Bailly and Timothy Fosu-Mensah, will be important options for him for the rest of the season. Manchester United squad vs Liverpool: De Gea, Romero, Grant, Jones, Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Williams, Bailly, Maguire, Dalot, Shaw, Lingard, Matic, Fred, Pereira, Gomes, Mata, Chong, James, Martial, Greenwood.

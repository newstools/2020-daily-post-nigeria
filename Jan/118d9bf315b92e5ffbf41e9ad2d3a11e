Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted that he will field a similar starting XI that defeated Norwich City 4-0 in the Premier League over the weekend against Wolves in Wednesday’s FA Cup fixture at Old Trafford. The Norwegian also said that defender, Eric Bailly is edging closer to full fitness, adding the Ivory Coast international will feature for the Red Devils’ youth team behind-closed-doors in their friendly with Sheffield Wednesday’s youngsters later today (Tuesday). Speaking at his pre-match conference on Tuesday ahead of Man United’s FA Cup clash against Wolves on Wednesday night, Solskjaer told MUTV: “We’ll probably have a similar squad to what we had at the weekend against Norwich. “Eric is playing today, behind closed doors, so he’s very close to full fitness, but it’s still a few days early, this one.” The kick-off time for the match is 8:45pm. Meanwhile, Man United captain, Ashley Young looks set to miss out again while defender, Luke Shaw must be a doubt after feeling a tight hamstring in the warm-up at the weekend, with Tahith Chong taking his place on the bench. Midfielder, Jesse Lingard’s involvement is also uncertain after he missed the Norwich game through illness. Paul Pogba, Scott McTominay and Marcos Rojo are currently on the sidelines with injuries.

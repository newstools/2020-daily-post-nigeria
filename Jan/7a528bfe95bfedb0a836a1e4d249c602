Victor Moses is set to seal a loan move to Inter Milan, with a €10million (£9m/$11m) option to buy. On Monday, Blues boss Frank Lampard, confirmed that the Nigerian would be returning to Stamford Bridge, from his loan deal with Turkish side Fenerbahce. However, Goal reports Lampard is allowing Moses leave again, this time to Italy. Moses is set for a reunion with his former Chelsea boss, Antonio Conte, after Inter’s swap deal to sign Roma’s Leonardo Spinazzola, with Matteo Politano going the other way, collapsed. Inter have already signed Manchester United’s Ashley Young in a €1.5m deal and the 34-year-old will likely play as the left-sided wing-back, with Moses on the right side.

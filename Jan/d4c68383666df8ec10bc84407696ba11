Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, on Tuesday, said no circumstance should make Nigeria drift towards a one-party state.
Wike explained that all political parties needed to exist for Nigerians to explore all alternatives. Speaking when he hosted the new leadership of KAGOTE, an elite socio-cultural organization for the Ogoni Ethnic Nationality at the Government House Port Harcourt, Wike
said being members of different political parties should not deny Nigeria the much needed development. He said: “Party is a vehicle to a political position. When you get to that destination, you alight and work towards development. It should not stop us from seeking the development of our communities, irrespective of our political affiliations. “We will not support a one-party State under any guise. Though people belong to different political parties, we should work together for development. There is no law that says everyone must belong to one political party.” Wike urged KAGOTE to work towards ensuring peace in Ogoni communities to create environment for peace. “We should work for peace in Ogoni communities. The situation where there is insecurity in some communities is affecting development. “I urge you to use your good offices to ensure that there is peace in Ogoniland. We must not allow criminals to speak on behalf of communities”, he said.

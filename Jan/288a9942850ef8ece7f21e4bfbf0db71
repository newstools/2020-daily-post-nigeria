A trailer, at about 8 am on Monday, crushed to death a commercial motorcyclist and his female passenger along the Eku/Abraka road near Osubi slaughter market in Okpe Local Government Area of Delta State. The trailer driver fled the scene for fear of being mobbed. DAILY POST learnt that the trailer was on high speed when the vehicle had a brake failure and veered off the road, killing the commercial motorcyclist and his passenger. The incident sparked a serious protest amongst motorcyclists who bore leaves on their motorbikes. The motorcyclists during their protest along the PTI/DSC Expressway axis of the East West Road, demanded that the trailer driver be fished out and the law should take its course. The Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Hafiz Inuwa did not pick his calls to confirm the report.

The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has revealed what President Muhammadu Buhari told All Progressive Congress (APC) Youth Leaders, its President Bello Shagari, among others, at a meeting at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. This was contained in a statement signed Mr Mukhtar Jebba, the Organising Secretary, NYCN Headquarters, on Sunday. He said: “President Buhari re-emphasised his administration’s commitment to youth inclusion in government to ensure good governance. “The President also called on the Nigerian Youth to shun ethnicity and religious discrimination. “Hence, the Nigerian youth must heed the call of President Muhammadu Buhari in their best interest. “As youth leaders, we will continue to work toward making a better and the best living standard among the Nigerian youth in order to ensure brighter future for all of us,” the statement read in part.

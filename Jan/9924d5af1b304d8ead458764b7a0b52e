Dozens of US citizens working for foreign oil companies in the southern Iraqi oil city of Basra left the country on Friday, the oil Ministry said, according Aljazeera. The US embassy in Baghdad had urged all its citizens to leave Iraq immediately. Iraqi officials said the evacuation would not affect operations, production or exports. Meanwhile, the flags at Iranian embassies abroad were ordered to fly at half-mast and preparations were being made for Soleimani’s body to be transferred to Iran. The date for the funeral has yet to be announced. Responding to the US’s killing of Soleimani, Iran’s National Security Council spokesman Keyvan Khosravi said: “The legal, political, security, and military consequences of this crime is on the US government.” “The costs that Washington has to pay will be much more severe than the mirage-like achievements of this sort of blind moves,” he added.

Manchester legend, Gary Neville, has said that Roberto Firmino’s goal for Liverpool against Manchester United should have stood. Jurgen Klopp’s side were already leading 1-0 thanks to Virgil van Dijk’s header before Firmino thought he had made it 2-0. However, a review by VAR showed that the goal was ruled out due to a foul on David de Gea by Virgil van Dijk. But Neville said De Gea should have done more and the call made by Paul Tierney at Stockley Park was wrong. “They think it’s a foul by Virgil van Dijk on David de Gea but my initial reaction was it absolutely wasn’t,” the former United full-back told Sky Sports. “It looked like he just dropped it. We will see on VAR and it will come down to whether van Dijk has raised his arm or not. “I don’t think that’s a foul. Van Dijk has basically dropped his arms and jumped for the ball but we shall see. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is furious, David de Gea is furious. We’ve seen it before, David, you’ve got to be stronger when challenged. “I just think he drops it. I think it’s soft. If it was against me at the other end, I wouldn’t expect a foul.”

Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that he has handed defender, Harry Maguire the United captaincy on a permanent basis. This is as Ashley Young edges closer to a move to Inter Milan, pending a medical. He also confirmed that Young will definitely leave Old Trafford this January. Maguire has been handed the armband just six months after his £80 million (Dh383m) move from Leicester. Solskjaer told reporters, “Everything about him tells me that he is a leader. Harry will keep wearing the armband now.” He went on to pay tribute to Young, and admitted the 34-year-old’s move to San Siro marked an unmissable opportunity at this stage of his career. He added, “Ashley is 35 in the summer and if he gets a two-year contract somewhere I think it’s up to him to take [something] that we weren’t ready to offer. “He’s been a good servant to the club, he’s been captain and won leagues and trophies but we’ve got other players coming through and Ashley’s mindset was, ‘I want to try something new’. “So it was time. He’s done a fantastic job and he’s served this club fantastically. I think it was an opportunity for him that we had to say yes to. We got a transfer fee for someone who’s been so loyal to the club.”

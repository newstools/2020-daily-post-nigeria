The US has made a fresh claim about the assassinated Iranian army general, Qassem Soleimani. The US, through its Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday that the Iranian military commander was not in Baghdad pursuing a peaceful diplomatic mission when the United States airstrike killed him. There have been claims from both Iran and Iraq that the army chief was in Baghdad pursuing a peaceful diplomatic mission when he was killed at the airport on Friday. US President Donald Trump had earlier given some reasons why Soleimani was killed. Iran has vowed to retaliate their army chief’s death, claiming that his murder was a war act. Addressing reporters on Tuesday, Pompeo said, “Is there any history that would indicate that it was remotely possible that this kind gentleman, this diplomat of great order – Qassem Soleimani – had traveled to Baghdad for the idea of conducting a peace mission? “We know that wasn’t true,” according to Al Jazeera.

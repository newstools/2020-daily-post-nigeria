Edu Memorial Lecture in Lagos, said the figure had been rising daily. He spoke on the theme: “The Role of Traditional Leaders in Protecting and Restoring the Nigerian Environment.” Abubakar stated that the effects were higher in locations where desertification was more serious. “It affects food security, food availability and food affordability. I want you to note that food production is not food availability, but food affordability,” the monarch said.

He stated that event had shown that the “realities of climate change was here. “There is 600 metres desert encroachment per annum and 60 per cent of farmland have been affected and food security is being threatened daily.” He also cautioned politicians, traditional and religious leaders against politicising climate change crisis in the country, stressing that there was need to mobilise everybody to protect the environment. The Sultan noted that the roles of traditional leaders in mitigating environmental issues are enormous. “They relate with the people, live among them, speak their language and enjoy their trust,” be added. The monarch also called for monitoring and evaluation of environmental programmes, stressing that this was important to meet the set target.

I never saw the stoves. Where are the stoves and where is the money?”

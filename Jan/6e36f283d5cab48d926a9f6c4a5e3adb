Ukraine International Airlines President Yevhenii Dykhne on Saturday said he never doubted that the airline had not caused the crash of its passenger plane in Iran. Dykhne said this following Iran’s claim that it accidentally fired down the plane. The jetliner, a Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, went down on the outskirts of Tehran during takeoff just hours after Iran launched a barrage of missiles at US forces in Iraq. Dykhne in a statement on social media said all along he had faith in the plane’s crew and doubted they were responsible for the plane crash mistakenly shot down the plane, NAN reports. “We didn’t doubt for a second that our crew and our plane couldn’t be the cause for this horrible plane crash. “These were our best guys and girls. The best,” Dykhne said.

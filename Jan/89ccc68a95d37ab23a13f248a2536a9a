Cities across the Canada, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States witnessed protests on Saturday over the killing of a top Iranian General, Qassem Soleimani. He was killed on Friday in Baghdad by a US airstrike. There were demonstrations in New York’s Times Square; in Chicago, where hundreds of protesters gathered outside the Trump Tower and in Philadelphia, where about 500 people demonstrated. The actor and activist Jane Fonda joined a rally outside the White House in Washington. Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER), a U.S.-based anti-war coalition, said the group and others would continue the protests. ANSWER said their actions are “against a new war in the Middle East and calling for the withdrawal of all U.S. troops and bases in the region”. In London, senior lawmakers from Britain’s main opposition Labour party joined dozens of anti-war protesters to urge restraint by Western governments amid tension with Iran. “From our experience of the build-up to the (2003) Iraq war, it’s vitally important for us to stand up firmly and early for peace,” Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted. The Stop the War Coalition organized the protest outside Downing Street, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s official residence. Its convener, Lindsey German, said the killing of Soleimani was “an act of war” by Trump. “Trump has been heading for war since tearing up the nuclear deal with Iran, and if he succeeds, (he) will create a bigger war than we have seen in the Middle East,” German said.

A magistrate’s court sitting in Osogbo, the Osun State capital on Wednesday arraigned a staff of Osun Internal Revenue Service (OIRS), Mr Dare Ogunrinde for allegedly stealing the sum of N665, 712 (Six hundred and sixty-five thousand seven hundred and twelve Naira). The accused person was arraigned on a 2-count charge bothering on stealing and breach of peace. According to the Police Prosecutor, ASP Abiodun Fatoyinbo, Ogunrinde, a level 10 officer with the agency received the said sum as a tax from a firm, Orbitwood and Allied Company, and refused to remit the amount to government’s coffer. He said that the offence committed contravenes section 353 and punishable under section 390(9) of criminal code, cap 34, vol.11, law of Osun State, 2002. Fatoyinbo added that the accused person, by his refusal to issue tax receipt of the amount paid conducted himself in a manner that could cause breach of peace, thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under section 249(9) of criminal code cap 34 law of Osun State, 2002. The accused person, however, pleaded not guilty to the allegations preferred against him, as his counsel, Musa Abdullahi pleaded with the court to grant his client bail on liberal terms. The Magistrate, O.A. Ayilara, therefore, granted the accused person bail with N500,000 with 2 sureties in like sum, in which one of them must be a civil servant of not less than level 10, and must be a house owner with evidence of such. Also, both sureties must swear an affidavit of means. He, thereafter, adjourned the case to March 15 for hearing.

Liverpool midfielder, Fabinho, has revealed that it would be a headache for the Reds if Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe joins Jurgen Klopp’s side. He also stated that the France World Cup winner will improve Liverpool. Fabinho played alongside Mbappe during their time at AS Monaco in the French Ligue 1. The Brazilian wants the Mbappe to make a transfer move to Liverpool. “At this moment it would be a headache for Liverpool if we had him here because our attacking trio is very good,” Fabinho told SPORTbible. “But I know Mbappe’s quality, he’s already one of the best players in the world, so he would obviously improve any team. “Right now he plays for Paris Saint-Germain and we have to respect that.” Meanwhile, Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has recently admitted that Mbappe is too expensive for the club. Klopp said: “Buying this calibre of player is difficult. I don’t see any club at the moment who can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG.”

Emmanuel Adebayor could be set for a shock return to the Premier League, after being offered to Aston Villa, the UK Sun reports. Villa are stuck in relegation places, with Dean Smith’s side in 17th place. They have struggled for goals, with captain Jack Grealish bearing the burden. With £22million signing Wesley now ruled out for the rest of the season with a knee injury, Smith is short of strikers. Villa are now looking to Adebayor, who is a free agent. The 36-year-old left Turkish side Kayserispor last month. He has previously played for Arsenal, Tottenham, Crystal Palace and Manchester City in the Premier League.

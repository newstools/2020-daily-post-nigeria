Manchester United will not be able to bring Alexis Sanchez back to Old Trafford to replace the injured Marcus Rashford, because there is no recall option in his loan deal at Inter Milan, the Daily Mail reports. Rashford has been ruled out for up to three months with a double stress fracture in his back. On Sunday, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer confirmed that United will look at signing a short-term replacement for their 22-year-old striker this month. And with just 11 days of the January transfer window remaining, United now face a race against time to strengthen their squad, having allowed Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku to leave for Inter in the summer. While Lukaku signed for Inter permanently, Sanchez joined on loan until the end of the season and could have been an option to return in United’s hour of need. But it’s understood that the two clubs did not include a clause enabling United to bring him back.

Real Madrid have confirmed that 24-year-old right-back, Alvaro Odriozola has left the club to join Bayern Munich on loan until the end of the season. The Los Blancos made this known in a statement on their official website on Wednesday. The statement read: “Real Madrid CF and Bayern Munich have agreed to transfer the player Álvaro Odriozola for this season, until June 30, 2020.” Odriozola joined Zinedine Zidane’s side from Real Sociedad in 2018. The defender was included in Spain’s final 2018 World Cup squad, but never got off the bench as La Roja were eliminated in the round of 16 to Russia. He started 32 games for Sociedad in the La Liga before he joined Real Madrid.

Iran’s Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has asked US President Donald Trump to apologize for the killing of the country’s top military commander, Qasem Soleimani. Zarif, in an interview with CNN, Tuesday, said Trump should apologize for his act of “state terrorism”. He said: “This is an act of aggression against Iran and amounts to an armed attack against Iran, and we will respond. But we will respond proportionally not disproportionally. “We will respond lawfully, we are not lawless people like President Trump.” On Trump’s vow that 52 Iranian sites, Zarif said those comments showed Trump “has no respect for international law and is prepared to commit war crimes — attacking cultural sites is a war crime. “President Trump, after watching the crowds (Soleimani’s funeral), must stop threatening these people who will be further enraged by his threats — his threats will not frighten us. “A war was started a long time ago by the United States, the United States destroyed stability in this region, the United States undermined security in this region.” Meanwhile, the Iranian parliament has voted to designate the U.S. Army and Pentagon as terrorist entities. The country’s Tasnim news agency reported that the parliament also permitted the government to allocate 200 million euros from the National Development Fund for the elite Quds Force. Iran has repeatedly vowed a “harsh retaliation”.

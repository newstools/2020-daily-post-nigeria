Manchester United are ready to give Alexis Sanchez another chance to prove himself at the club, according to the Daily Star. Sanchez joined Serie A club Inter Milan on a season-long loan during the summer, after a miserable 18 months at Old Trafford. The 31-year-old netted only five times in 45 appearances, following his move from Arsenal in January 2018. Although he had not been expected to play for United again, the club has made a U-turn and are now planning to welcome him back at the end of the season. It is believed that Unitedâ€™s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has informed Sanchez and his agent that they have no intention of letting him join Inter or any other club on a permanent basis.

Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, flashed the number “24” with his fingers, during their 2-0 win over Lille on Sunday, in honour of former NBA star, Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash earlier in the day along with his daughter, Gianni. Neymar scored twice to help PSG extend their Ligue 1 lead to 10 points. After the second goal, he made the gesture and pointed to the sky in front of a camera. After the match, Neymar told Canal+: “I saw the messages [about Bryant] on social media at half-time. It’s a big sadness for the world of sport and for all of us, not just basketball fans. “I knew him and I did this celebration for him. I hope he will rest in peace.” Neymar’s former Barcelona teammate, Lionel Messi, wrote on Instagram: “I have no words. All my love for Kobe’s family and friends. It was a pleasure to meet you and share good times together. We lost a genius like no other.”

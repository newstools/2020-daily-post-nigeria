Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka has commended the south west governors over the idea of the Western Nigeria Security Network, which has been code-named ‘Operation Amotekun’. Amotekun (or The South West Security Network), has since commenced operations in all the six states in Yourubaland Reactions have continued to trail Amotekun launched on January 9, 2019. Soyinka speaking at the “Never Again” conference that took place in Lagos on Monday to commemorate 50 years of the end of the Nigerian civil war, described Amotekun as a desirable New Year gift. The Nobel laureate said he had earlier given up on the political leadership of the region until the launch of the security outfit. According to him, ‘Amotekun’ security outfit has fulfilled the ‘yearning of the people’. Soyinka said: “My second remark is to say thank you a number of public-spirited, humanity-considering governors in this nation, who finally responded to the demand and yearnings of the citizens and produced one organization called Amotekun. “This is most unexpected. I had given up on them. It was the most unexpected, but desirable New Year present this nation has ever received. “Whether you agree or disagree, the point is, the yearning of the people has been fulfilled.”

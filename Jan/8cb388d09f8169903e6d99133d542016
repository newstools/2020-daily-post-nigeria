Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Saturday said it lost the state to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) because God wanted to test the party. APC Chairman, Lawal Liman, spoke on the Supreme Court ruling on Imo governorship election at the party’s monthly stakeholders meeting in Kaura-Namoda. Liman said the APC members in the state deserved commendation considering their patience and persistence in supporting the party in spite of the challenges they are facing. “We are aware of the challenges that our members are facing from the present PDP-led administration in the state. “Though we have lost the leadership of the state as a result of Supreme Court judgement, we shouldn’t be discouraged because of fear of witch-hunting and harassment; we should consider it as a test from God”, he said. Liman urged the PDP-led government in the state to accept that, “the room for opposition is provided in the nation’s constitution, therefore any democratic government must accept opposition”. He urged party members and supporters in the state to continue to be united, patient and law-abiding. “The recent reconciliation with the former APC governorship aspirant, Alhaji Aminu Jaji and defection of former PDP governorship aspirant, Alhaji Ibrahim Shehu-Bakauye to the party has increased our strength”, Liman added. Bola Tinubu, national leader of the APC, had revealed why the court declared the party winner in Imo. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous judgment on Tuesday, sacked Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP as Imo governor and declared Hope Uzodinma as duly elected. A seven-man panel, in its decision held, that Ihedioha did not win the majority of votes cast at the March 9, 2019 governorship election. The judgment delivered by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun held that the candidate of the APC won on grounds that he polled majority of the lawful votes cast at the election.

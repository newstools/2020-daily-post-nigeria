An Oyo State High Court sitting in Ibadan, the state capital, on Tuesday, restrained the 68 sacked Chairmen in the 33 Local Government Areas and 35 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) from the forceful and illegal takeover of the council offices across the state. DAILY POST gathered that the council bosses, who were sacked last year by Governor Seyi Makinde, resumed their various offices on Monday. But, the Court, presided over by Honourable Justice Moshud A.A. Abass, granted the four reliefs sought by the lead counsel to the Oyo State Government, Dr. Akin Onigbinde (SAN) including an order of interim injunction restraining the sacked chairmen from forcefully taking over the Local Government Councils or taking steps capable of causing breach of peace in the State. The orders of interim injunction, which were granted by the Oyo State High Court, followed an ex-parte motion filed by the State Government in Suit No: I/78/2020. Also restrained were the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN; Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar; Commissioner of Police, Oyo State Command, Mr. Shina Olukolu, and the Oyo State APC chairman, Mr. Akin Oke. The parties and their agents were restrained from taking any step that could tamper with the pending hearing and determination of the Motion on Notice. According to the Court, the sacked chairmen, as well as the four other defendants, their officers, agents, privies or otherwise, were restrained from taking steps that would cause a breach of peace by embarking on self-help to give effect to a letter dated 14th January 2020 with reference number HAGF/OYO/2020/VOL.I/1 issued by the Attorney General of the Federation to the sacked chairmen and the Inspector General of Police pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice.

The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has said Federal government’s borrowing would be invested in the development of the nation’s infrastructure. Fashola disclosed this during his inspection tour of Highway projects in Niger State and was contained in a statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST by his Deputy Director Press, Stephen Kilebi. He explained that borrowing invested on infrastructure would create jobs and help the country achieve self- sustaining economy. The projects the Minister inspected were: the dualization of Suleja-Minna Phase I and phase II, the reconstruction of Bida-Lapai-Lambata road, the construction of Agaie-Katcha-Barro road, dualization of Jebba-Mokwa-Bokani road and rehabilitation of New Bussa-Kaiama road. Speaking during the inspection, Fashola said, “A nation’s wealth is measured by its infrastructure. “The concern of Nigerians on government borrowing is legitimate, but borrowing should be weighed with the problem they are used to solve. “People need infrastructure if they can see that the money borrowed is used to deliver critical infrastructure, then their queries can be assuaged. “Each of the road projects inspected has the capacity to employ over a thousand workforce. This would help the Federal Government’s drive in creating jobs for its teaming unemployment youths.”

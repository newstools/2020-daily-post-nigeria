An outbreak of a new coronavirus has spread to more Chinese cities, including the capital, Beijing and Shanghai, national and local authorities confirmed on Monday. Also, a fourth case has been reported beyond China’s borders. President Xi Jinping said curbing the outbreak and saving lives was a top priority as the number of patients more than tripled and a third person died. Adding to the difficulties of containing the virus, hundreds of millions of Chinese will be traveling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday that starts this week. Authorities around the globe, including in the U.S. and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travelers from Wuhan, the central city where the virus was first discovered, NAN reports “Wuhan is a major hub and with travel being a huge part of the fast approaching Chinese New Year, the concern level must remain high. “There is more to come from this outbreak,” said Jeremy Farrar, a specialist in infectious disease epidemics and Director of the Wellcome Trust Global Health Charity. Authorities confirmed a total of 217 new cases of the virus in China as of 6 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) on Monday, state television reported 198 of which were in Wuhan. Five new cases were confirmed in Beijing and 14 more in Guangdong province, the report said. Another statement confirmed a new case in Shanghai, bringing the number of known cases worldwide to 222. “People’s lives and health should be given top priority and the spread of the outbreak should be resolutely curbed,” President Xi was quoted as saying by state television. The virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China. Its symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing and are similar to many other respiratory diseases that pose complications for screening efforts. South Korea on Monday confirmed its first case, a 35-year-old Chinese national who had traveled from Wuhan, the fourth patient reported outside China. The World Health Organisation said on Monday “an animal source” appeared most likely to be the primary source of the outbreak and that some “limited human-to-human transmission” occurred between close contacts. China’s state council reiterated the government will step up prevention efforts and find the source of infection and transmission channels as soon as possible, state television said on Monday.

The House of Representatives has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to relieve the nation’s Service Chiefs of their jobs. The call was sequel to the adoption of a motion of urgent public importance moved by Abubakar Fulata. Fulata who is a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) said that irrespective of their tenure, the service chiefs should resign. He argued that doing the same thing over time without a tweak in tactic would yield the same result, and to expect something different is “insanity.” “Whether their tenures have expired or not, they should resign,” Mr Fulata said of the service chiefs. Speaking on the motion, Muhammed Monguno from Borno state revealed that there has been a resurgence in the activities of the extremist groups in Northeast. “I regret to announce that of recent, there is a resurgence in the activities of Boko Haram, to the extent of threatening the territorial integrity of this country as manifested in the consistent attacks on Maiduguri- Damaturu Road. And this Maiduguri- Damaturu Road is the only axis that Maiduguri and Yobe State has to the other parts of the country. It also links Nigeria to the Republic of Cameroon and the Republic of Chad. If this is allowed to go on; not only social activities but business activities will be affected,” he said. Also contributing to the motion, Babajimi Benson from Lagos state disclosed that the National Security Adviser, Babangida Monguno can not visit his own home. ” The NSA is from Maiduguri, he can’t get to his village. The Chief of Army Staff is from Borno, he can’t go to his village. The Chief of Air Staff is from the North East, he can’t go to his village. “That speaks volume of their inability to take us to the next level. But the decision lies with the Commander-in-Chief. I don’t know what he sees in the service chiefs, that he is still keeping them,” Benson stated

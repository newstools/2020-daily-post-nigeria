Liverpool ace, Mohamed Salah says Jurgen Klopp’s men are not thinking about being unbeaten until the end of the season. According to Salah, Liverpool only wants to win this season’s Premier League title, adding that it is the most important thing for the Reds. The Egyptian international said this ahead of Liverpool’s Premier League clash with Manchester United on Sunday evening at Anfield. “Our focus now is just on the Manchester United game, we take one game at a time,” Salah told Premier League Productions at Melwood. “We don’t think about being unbeaten until the end of the season. If we do that, it would be great, but at the end of the day we just want to win the Premier League. That’s the most important thing. “Unbeaten or not, it’s not necessary – we want to win the Premier League. “We need to win [against United], we need to carry on in our way – the way we’ve been doing since the beginning of the season and since last year. It’s a game we have to win. “Of course we know it’s big for the fans, for the city and for us. But at the end of the day, we play the game to win. It’s unbelievable.” Liverpool have not lost a match in the Premier League this season so far. The UEFA Champions League and Super Cup holders have won 20 games and drew 1.

The Federal Medical Centre, Yola has scheduled a set of conjoined twins for surgical separation. This follows a revelation that the Civil-Military Relations Unit of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) had airlifted the set of conjoined twins along with their parents and medical team from Yenagoa, in Bayelsa State, to Yola, the Adamawa State capital. The purpose is to have a successful separation of the twins, joined at the abdomen. It was further learnt that NAF’s involvement is in furtherance of its humanitarian commitments. Chief Medical Director of the FMC Yola, Prof. Auwal Muhammed, confirmed to DAILY POST that the hospital had received the twins. He said, however, that the surgical procedure to separate them would not be carried out immediately. “It won’t be done until after some months,” he said, adding that the twins need to grow some more before the procedure could take place. The Public Relations Officer of the hospital, Adamu Dogo, who was contacted on the ages of the conjoined twins, said they were just a few months old. “We can’t say much on these children. We do not publicise these issues until we have finished the procedure. We must avoid undue attention on the babies and their parents,” the hospital image maker said. If the surgical procedure eventually takes place, it will be the third time since 2014 that the hospital would separate conjoined twins. The hospital successfully separated conjoined female twins (Omphalopagus) in May 2018. The first of such a success story had been in 2014.

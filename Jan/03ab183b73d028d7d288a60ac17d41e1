In a video, he posted on Instagram on Tuesday, Pogba said: “Guys, I’m making a video on insta, I don’t even know if I’m ok or if I’m high or sober – I don’t look sober, don’t ask me if it went well because I don’t know “I can’t really feel my toes but I’m still alive, that’s the good news. “After the operation, we’ve still got the smile, we’re blessed, I’m still alive, everything went well. They gave me something, I don’t know what it was but it feels good! “They took something and put it in my arms then after that they told me to think about good things – I thought about my son then it took longer to put me to sleep “After, I don’t know what happened. I just woke up and said, where am I? “I thought I could drink my pee pee, it looks like apple juice. “People have told me I look drunk, I didn’t drink alcohol, they gave me some things on my arm they told me to relax, they spoke very good French. “I imagined I was in Dubai then… I woke up and I couldn’t lift my leg. I didn’t know where I was, but I’m not drunk.”

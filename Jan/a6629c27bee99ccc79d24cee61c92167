Manchester United are ready to walk away from a deal to sign Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon, ESPN reports. Sporting want €65million upfront and another €15m in add-ons for Fernandes. United are not willing to pay that much, as the Portuguese side were prepared to let the midfielder join Tottenham last summer for around €45m plus add-ons. Fernandes is keen to move to Old Trafford, but the transfer is on the brink of collapse, unless his club lowers their valuation. Sporting had hoped to include Marcos Rojo in any agreement, but the Argentine defender is not keen to return to his former club. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is in need of a midfielder, after losing Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay to injury.

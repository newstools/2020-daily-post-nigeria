Arsenal are set to allow at least three youngsters leave on loan in the coming days, the UK Mirror reports. Eddie Nketiah, Emith Smith Rowe and Tyreece John-Jules will leave the Emirates to gain experience elsewhere. Nketiah, 20, was recalled from Leeds this month, for lack of playing time. Bristol City missed out on Nketiah in the summer, but remain keen on taking him until the end of the season. Sheffield Wednesday and Nottingham Forest are interested in the striker. Smith Rowe has also been in discussions with interested parties over a temporary switch. The winger impressed whilst on loan at RB Leipzig last season and is attracting further attention from the Bundesliga. John-Jules is the third player hoping to gain first-team experience away from the Emirates, after signing a new contract in summer.

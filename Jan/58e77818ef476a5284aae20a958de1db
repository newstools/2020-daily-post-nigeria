Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) technical assistant, Tunde Adelakun, has confirmed that Ademola Lookman, has applied to FIFA to switch his allegiance to the Super Eagles from England. Lookman was born in England to Nigerian parents and has played for English youth teams. He is however still eligible to play for Nigeria, having not featured for the Three Lions in a competitive game. “Lookman has applied for the switch and all the documents are in order,” Adelakun said according to AOI. “It’s a positive step forward when he made his commitment to Nigeria and we are just waiting for a FIFA clearance. “Once the go-ahead is sorted, it will be up to coach Gernot Rohr to decide if his club performance would earn him a call-up. “He’s one of three former England youth players we’ve filed for but they are all aware of the caveat. All the players were told that they can only earn a place in the squad by playing regular club football.”

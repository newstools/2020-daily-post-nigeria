Former Manchester United striker, Michael Owen, has backed his former team to see off Wolves in the FA Cup replay. Both sides played a 0-0 draw in the first clash of their third-round tie at Molineux. Owen is expecting United to seal qualification at the second time of asking. He told Bet Victor: “Manchester United have scored four times in their last two home league games, but I feel two might be enough to see them through to the fourth round against a Wolves side who have gone a bit cold in front of goal in recent weeks – just two scored in their last four winless games. “The original tie 10 days ago at Molineux was a disappointing affair, but I would be surprised if we see a similar game at Old Trafford. “When they are on song, United have pace and quality in abundance, although they remain light on numbers and class in midfield. I expect United to win a cracking Cup tie and go into the weekend game at Anfield on the front foot.”

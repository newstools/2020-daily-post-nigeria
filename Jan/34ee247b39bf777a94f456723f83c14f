Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has said it is “really annoying” that Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has won more Ballons d’Or than Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi moved one ahead of Ronaldo in December, taking it home for a record sixth time. The result came despite Ronaldo helping Juve to an eighth consecutive Serie A title and pushing Portugal to win the inaugural Nations League crown. Sarri is determined for his star player, to add to his Ballon d’Or collection and match Messi. “I would like to help Cristiano win the sixth Ballon d’Or first. “It’s really annoying thinking that someone won more [Ballons d’Or] than him. “I think about him and I think helping him, it is my goal and the goal of the team. It is right for him,” Sarri told reporters after their 4-0 win over Udinese on Wednesday night.

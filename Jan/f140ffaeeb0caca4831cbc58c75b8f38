Mr Ibrahim Magu, the acting Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has reacted to backlash by Nigerians, condemning the raid at Club 360 in Ibadan Oyo State. The Commission had come under attack over the arrest of 89 suspected internet fraudsters at the Club 360. DAILY POST reported that EFCC Ibadan zonal office arrested 89 suspected internet fraudsters at the Club 360 located on Akala Expressway, Oluyole Extension in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital last weekend. This action led to a backlash from Nigerians on social media. However, reacting on Wednesday, Magu said the commission raids clubs because that’s where internet fraudsters gather and spend the money gotten from their victims. “If it is nightclubs, these are the places the yahoo boys gather and spend the money. There is nothing wrong in raiding the yahoo boys at nightclubs,” he said. The EFCC boss, who was in Ibadan to inspect the new recruits of the commission at the state zonal office on Wednesday added that “It is not about nightclub, raiding of nightclub is left to the police, we don’t have much power, and we will go there when we are sure it is the fraudsters. “We are not raiding nightclub, we are going after the yahoo yahoo boys and we always do that when we have a credible intelligence. “What we will do is that we have to collaborate to rehabilitate them into the society. These are small boys who are intelligent, they can be useful. “There are a lot of fraudsters who have made millions, we can find a way to bring them back so they can be better citizens tomorrow.”

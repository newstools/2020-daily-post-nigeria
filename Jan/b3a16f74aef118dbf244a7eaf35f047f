Paul Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola, has slammed the “morons” who attacked Ed Woodward’s home on Tuesday. A group of Manchester United fans threw flares at the Woodwards’s mansion in Cheshire, which he shares with his wife and their young twins. The family was not home at the time of the incident. Raiola, speaking with The Athletic, insisted there is no excuse for the attack on Woodward’s property and called for those responsible to face action. “If anyone has used me as a reason to create any anger towards Ed, they are totally in the wrong because my relationship with Ed is good, it is professional, and we don’t always need to agree but that’s normal. “What happened last night is not normal. It is violence and I condemn any type of violence. These guys are morons and this is criminal behaviour. “These people need to be locked up and re-educated. This cannot be part of sport. This is sport — S P O R T. This is not a question of life and death, it is EN-TER-TAIN-MENT. “Do you think people attack the house of Brad Pitt if he makes a bad movie? Or does Quentin Tarantino get death threats because his film was not good? “There is no reason or excuse, none whatsoever for this and Ed Woodward has my full support and solidarity,” Raiola said.

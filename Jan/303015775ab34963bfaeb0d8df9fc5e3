The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ebonyi State has reacted to claim by Gov. Dave Umahi of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that he also belonged to APC. The governor was quoted to have told the people of Ishielu and Onicha Local Government Areas at the Government House, Abakaliki, on Monday, that he was “100 per cent APC.” Addressing newsmen at the end of the APC State Executive Committee’s meeting on Friday in Abakiliki, the Chairman of the party, Chief Eze Nwachukwu, called on relevant authorities to investigate the claim. He noted that such an utterance by a top government officeholder was capable of endangering the nation’s party democracy. “The alleged bipartisan claim credited to our dear governor is capable of jeopardising the nation’s party democracy”, NAN quoted him as saying. “There is nowhere it is provided in the Electoral Act for a person to belong to two political parties, especially one occupying an executive position. “So, we view the comment with great concern because it is capable of truncating the country’s democracy,” Nwachukwu said.

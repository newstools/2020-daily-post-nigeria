The United States of America has said it wants to reduce its military presence in Africa. Chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, stated this as he flew in for talks with NATO counterparts in Brussels. Milley said resources “could be reduced and then shifted, either to increase readiness of the force in the continental US or shifted to” the Pacific. He made the comments as he flew in for talks with NATO counterparts in Brussels. It comes after President Donald Trump’s call last week, for NATO to do more in the Middle East and as French President Emmanuel Macron gathers his counterparts from Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger, Mali and Mauritania. Milley said his boss, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, has however not made up his mind what changes to make. “We’re developing options for the secretary to consider, and we are developing those options in coordination with our allies and partners,” Milley said. Washington has about 7,000 special forces on rotation in Africa, carrying out joint operations with national forces against jihadists, particularly in Somalia.

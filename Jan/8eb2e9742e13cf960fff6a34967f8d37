Manchester United and Inter Milan have agreed a fee for Ashley Young, ESPN reports. Young is set to sign an 18-month contract with the Serie A side, with the option of an additional 12 months, after United accepted a bid of around â‚¬1.5million. The 34-year-old will fly to Italy on Friday to undergo a medical, before joining up with former teammates Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez at the San Siro. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, had hoped to keep Young until at least the end of the season. However, the England defender rejected the offer of a new contract, with his mind set on a move to Italy. Young made 261 appearances for United following his move from Aston Villa in 2011, winning the Premier League title in 2013.

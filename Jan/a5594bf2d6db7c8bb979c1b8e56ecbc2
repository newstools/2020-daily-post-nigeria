Benue State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sir John Ngbede, has described Tuesday’s Supreme Court judgment affirming the election of Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue, as a sound dispensation of justice richly deserved. The Supreme Court on Tuesday laid to rest, all litigations emanating from the March 9, 2019 governorship election in Benue State. Justice Sylvester Ngwuata, in a 30-second judgement, held that, “the judgement of the Tribunal and Court of Appeal need not to be disturbed”, thereby, striking out the appeal brought before the apex court by Barr. Emmanuel Jime, the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In an interview with our DAILY POST shortly after the judgment, the PDP Chairman, who was also joined in the suit, noted that Ortom’s victory at the polls was so comprehensive and solid that no amount of petition could have dislodged it. He said the people of the state spoke in one voice during the governorship election on the 9th of March and the supplementary polls on the 23rd of March, 2019 when they voted overwhelmingly for the party’s candidate. Ngbede expressed satisfaction that the Election Tribunal, Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court were unanimous in dismissing the appeal against the victory of the Governor, thereby upholding the choice of the people. He expressed gratitude to the people of the State for their unwavering support to the Governor and the PDP, while the elections and litigations lasted, assuring them that the administration would now settle down to offer them quality service devoid of distractions.

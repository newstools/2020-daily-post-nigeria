Founder and General Overseer of the Living Faith Church, a.k.a Winners Chapel, Bishop David Oyedepo, has accused his church accountants and some church officials of stealing millions. Oyedepo who made this known at the Church’s empowerment summit organised for ordained workers on Saturday said professionals trusted by the church to prevent fraud turned themselves into a ‘network of fraudsters. He said, “Can you imagine accountants perpetrating fraud in the house of God? “We had no choice but to dismiss them. You can imagine top church officials engaging in doubling figures and other dubious practices. “Even after we dismissed them, we discovered more fraud. “Those who should discover the fraud were the ones involved in it. One of them refused to confess until the last minute.” he added.
The cleric, however, advised members against employing those who had looted the church’s treasury.
According to him, he informed the church because he knows the dismissed officials will come to them for employment. “Don’t employ them and don’t sympathise with them. Whoever sympathises with the wicked is wicked himself.” “Don’t sympathise with any perpetrator of fraud, otherwise you are a partaker of the evil act,” the Nations quoted him as saying.

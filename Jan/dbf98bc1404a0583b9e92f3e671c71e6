Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has warned his forwards, Willian, Tammy Abraham, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Pedro, Olivier Giroud and Michy Batshuayi that they need to be ‘more clinical in the box and score more goals’ for the Blues. Lampard said this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Arsenal on Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge. Lampard’s men head to the game following a 1-0 defeat to Newcastle United over the weekend. “We need to be more clinical in the box in terms of our front line, when we attack and we spend a lot of time around the opposition box,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying. “We’ve chipped in with some goals from midfield and we have people who can arrive from midfield, but the brutal reality is that we need more goals from the front line.” He added: “I wouldn’t say they [Arsenal] will be out of it if we win, not with this season. I think any team that puts strong runs together, the picture can change very quickly. “We know they are a competitor and we know they are some points behind us, but we know that if they beat us they will feel they can close the gap on us. “So we know the seriousness of what it is, that’s why I think it’s better not to look around too much at other teams and just worry about yourself.”

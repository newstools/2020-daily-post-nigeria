Iran has put a bounty of $80 million on American President Donald Trump’s head. This decision was declared during the televised funeral of Maj. General Qasem Soleimani. During the televised funeral of Soleimani, official state broadcasters said one US dollar would be tabled for every Iranian in the country, with the cash going to whoever killed the US President, according to the Mirror. “Iran has 80 million inhabitants. Based on the Iranian population, we want to raise $80million (£61million) which is a reward for those who get close to the head of President Trump,” it was announced, according to en24. Soleimani, Iran’s preeminent military commander, was killed on Friday in a US drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport.

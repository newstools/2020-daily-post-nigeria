President of the Nigeria Senate, Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan, on Monday, said that the country’s security challenge was the concern of all Nigerians. Speaking at an interactive session with Senate Press Corps in Abuja, Lawan said it was not time for ‘buck passing’ as government was assiduously working to take care of security challenges. He, however, admitted that Nigeria’s security architecture was not working perfectly and efficiently, noting that, “the development was the reason for calls for change of security heads which has fallen on deaf ears. “The most important thing here is to look into the issue of security that is bedevilling this country. “Apparently and obviously, hands must be on deck to ensure that we bring back that security and tranquility that we had before. “Obviously, the story is not good in many areas. We have so much happening that is distabilising even our communities, killing of people and we believe that we owe Nigerians the responsibility to work together with the executive arm of Government. “Actually, to work together with the other arms of Government, the States and even the Local Governments to change the way security is handled. “Clearly, the system has not been working effectively and efficiently, and we have to do something and this time around, there should not be buck passing”, he insisted. He stressed that government would be sincere in tackling insecurity, adding that, “we have to say it as it is and we have to do it as it is required.”

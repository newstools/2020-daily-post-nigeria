Sen. Christopher Ekpenyong, Senator representing Akwa Ibom North-West, has called on the National Assembly to look properly into the Electoral Act, so as to give Nigerians the opportunity to choose their leaders. Ekpenyong made this call while speaking with journalists on Thursday in Abuja after he was sworn in as a senator by the President of the Senate, Dr Ahmad Lawan. The swearing in followed Ekpenyong’s victory at the just concluded re-run election ordered by the court and conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on January 25. Ekpenyong of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) defeated Godswill Akpabio of the All Progressives Congress (APC) having scored 134,717 as against 83,820 votes. “Thank God, I have come back to meet the discussion on the Electoral Act amendment because I am going to contribute”, he said. “What I have seen practically, the Electoral Bill and Act must be looked into properly and reviewed to give Nigerians the opportunity to choose their leaders. “Most importantly, our Electoral Act needs to be reviewed to give opportunity; People are talking about electronic voting system; yes electronic voting system would have been good if every Nigerian was educated. “But when you look at the poor, the uneducated in the farm, what we should do now is to make sure the card reader becomes a very strong device, both in accreditation and determination of who votes in the elections. “And it must be the card reader that determines the vote that is being cast, and not just saying when we go to the court, the court will say the card reader is just a mere device and not recognised by the law. “So, we must make sure the card reader is recognised by the law, so we can improve on our electoral system”, the lawmaker added.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has been warned by former team-mate, Joe Cole, not to splash out cash on a big-money striker this year. Cole, speaking on BT Sport, urged Lampard to keep faith with Tammy Abraham. The Blues have been linked with several names, since they successfully appealed their two-window ban by FIFA. With Olivier Giroud linked with an exit, it appears Lampard will surely bring in a new frontman. But Cole said: “Well, you certainly don’t need to replace him. “I think he has made himself irreplaceable as a member of the group at Chelsea because he’s a young lad who epitomises what the club is about. “He knows the club and that’s without the stuff that he’s doing on the pitch. On the pitch he’s been fantastic, he’s scored goals, he’s led the line, he’s been a revelation. “But what Chelsea, and any of the top clubs will do, is they will always look what’s around: ‘Can we improve?’ “So I think unless they’re going to bring in someone who is going to compete with him, not to go above him or below him as a youngster – someone to compete with him. “I believe he can [be Chelsea’s long-term striker]. The mentality, the mindset and when you’ve got a young player with them two attributes – forget the speed, the strength, technical ability – if you’ve got those two attributes, you can work with that and he’s just got better and better. “We’ve seen it with our own eyes how he’s got better over the last three, four years. He’s been a revelation.”

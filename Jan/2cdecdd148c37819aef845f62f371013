Liverpool will be without two key players, James Milner and Naby Keita when they face Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League fixture on Saturday due to muscle injuries. Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp made this known during his pre-match press conference on Friday morning. According to him, Milner and Keita are also likely to miss Liverpool’s clash against Manchester United at Anfield on January 19. “James [Milner] and Naby [Keita] are not unavailable. Both have muscle injuries and they are different people,” Klopp said. “We will see how quick it will be. We don’t have to put a timeframe on it. “We are open to when they want to join us again, when the medical team gives them the green light “Not for this weekend, not for next week. then we will see.” Liverpool head to the game following a 2-0 victory over Sheffield United in their last Premier League encounter. The kick-off time for the match is 6:30 pm.

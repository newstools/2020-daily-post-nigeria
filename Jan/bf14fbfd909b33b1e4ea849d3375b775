The Premier League has given reasons Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, was sent off during their 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday. Aubameyang was shown a straight red card in the second half after a VAR check, following a rash tackle on Max Meyer. The Gabon striker had earlier fired Arsenal in front, before Jordan Ayew earned a point for the home side. “VAR looked at the incident and determined that the point of contact and the intensity of the challenge endangered the safety of the opponent and recommended upgrading the yellow card to a red card for serious foul play,” the Premier League said in a statement. Aubameyang will now miss fixtures against Sheffield United, Chelsea and Bournemouth.

Presiding Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ, Adewale Giwa has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to tell Nigerians whether or not the kidnapped Dapchi Schoolgirl, Leah Shabiru had been forced by members of Boko Haram to renounce her Christian faith. Giwa, in a statement to DAILY POST on Monday, said he won’t join other Nigerians to believe that the abducted girl had accepted Islam. Boko Haram abducted Sharibu from Government Secondary School in Dapchi area of Yunusari Local Government in Yobe state, on February 19, 2018. Reports came out on Saturday night that Leah was forcefully converted to Islam and married to a top Boko Haram commander. Apart from this, it was reported that Leah also gave birth to a baby boy. However, Pastor Giwa said, “If you believe such a story, you can also believe anything that comes from President Muhammadu Buhari and his party. “To me, President Buhari and Boko Haram members owe Nigerians an explanation of Leah’s whereabouts. “They need to come out clean and tell Nigerians whether or not Leah has renounced her religion. “I urge Nigerians to continue to pray for the release of Leah if she is still alive by His grace. We cannot trust this government; we cannot also trust ourselves. “The group they brought has grown wings; they never believed they could go to this length. “As God liveth, they shall perish with their sponsors in Jesus Name. “The wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the Lord shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume, into smoke shall they consume away.”

Paris Saint-Germain striker, Edinson Cavani has reportedly decided not to leave the club this January transfer window amid interest from Chelsea and Atletico Madrid, according to L’Equipe. Cavani wants to remain at the Parisians this month as the January transfer window closes at 11pm on Friday (today). The Uruguay international will make a decision about his next club in the summer when he will be available on a free transfer. DAILY POST had reported that Cavani has drawn interest from Atletico Madrid and Chelsea in recent weeks. The 32-year-old preferred to join Atletico Madrid, but talks between him, PSG and the La Liga giants have broken down just hours before the transfer deadline. PSG have also announced Cavani’s price tag. Cavani has started just four games in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, having lost his place to Mauro Icardi who is on loan from Inter Milan. The former Napoli star was also dropped from PSG’s squad that defeated Lille 2-0 on Sunday in the French Ligue 1 encounter.

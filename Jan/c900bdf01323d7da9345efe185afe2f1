Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has denied any cover up in the shooting down Ukraine’s international airliner which left 176 persons dead. The government denied a “cover-up” after it took days for officials to admit that the plane was mistakenly shot down during a confrontation with the United States. Government spokesman Ali Rabiei said in remarks aired on state television on Monday, “In these sorrowful days, many criticisms were directed at relevant officials and authorities … some officials were even accused of lying and a cover-up but, in all honesty, that was not the case.” Ukrainian international flight (PS752) had crashed minutes after the takeoff from the Imam Khomeini International Airport in Tehran on Wednesday, hours after Iran launched missile attacks on US forces in Iraq in retaliation for the US assassination of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on January 3. Spokesman insists government did not lie about plane shut down and dismissed Trump’s messages of support for protesters. Rabiei insisted Iran’s civilian officials only learned on Friday that an Iranian missile had downed the plane “The point is that we did not lie,” he said, while blaming the US for “spreading the shadow of war over Iran.”

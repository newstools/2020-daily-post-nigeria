Six suspected NITEL Cable thieves have been arrested by the Cross River State Government at Atekong Street in Calabar Municipal Local Government Area. Disclosing this to newsmen on Friday in Calabar, the State Commissioner for Environment, Hon. Mfon Bassey, said his ministry worked in collaboration with the police to effect the arrest. He said that the suspected thieves stole NITEL cable and destroyed the green area of Atekong Street, close to the defunct NIPOST office in Calabar Municipality. “The suspects were arrested with one machine used in digging the area to remove the cable among other equipments.” On interrogation, the suspects failed to show valid papers of the authorisation for the removal of the cables. The Commissioner, however, warned that anyone caught destroying the green areas in Calabar will be arrested and prosecuted. He reiterated his commitment towards ensuring a clean and green Calabar for the interest of residents in the state and tourists. When DAILY POST called the phone line of the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo for reaction, she refused to pick her calls.

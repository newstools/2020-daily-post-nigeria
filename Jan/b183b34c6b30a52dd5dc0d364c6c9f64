Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has told his players to start feeding off energy from the fans, so they can “create more fear” for opposing teams. The Gunners host Leeds United in the FA Cup third round on Monday night. After their unsuccessful defence of the trophy last season, they will be desperate to qualify for the fourth round of the competition. Ahead of the game, Arteta has made it clear that he wants to transform the Emirates into a fortress. “When you take the fans to Wembley they are all proud of you. It’s a special day for everyone, they all travel with their families looking for success. “The history of this club means they are used to winning trophies and when you do that it generates something special. “So if we can get connected with the fan-base again, that will be a powerful weapon. “It’s in our own hands. If we can give the supporters what they want, I am sure they will give us even more. “When we know the fans are behind us, we have to pinch the players to react to them and use them to have a better performance and create more fear for the opponent,” the Spaniard said according to the UK Metro.

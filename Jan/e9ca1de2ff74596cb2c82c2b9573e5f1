Newcastle United legend, Alan Shearer, has paid tribute to Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero after the Argentine broke his Premier League record with a hat-trick against Aston Villa in a 6-1 win for Pep Guardiola’s men on Sunday. DAILY POST had reported that Aguero’s treble against Aston Villa saw him overtake Shearer with the most hat-tricks in the competitions’ history. The 31-year-old also went past Arsenal legend, Thierry Henry, to become the most prolific foreign goalscorer in the Premier League. “Congratulations to Sergio Aguero for breaking my record of Premier League hat-tricks,” Shearer said in a column for The Sun. “He’s a world-class goalscorer and arguably the best overseas player we’ve ever seen here. “At least I can enjoy my record of 260 Prem goals for a little while longer!”

Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano, has announced that he will pay the new minimum wage, starting from Jan. 26. Obiano made the declaration while inspecting the 5.3Km Eziowelle-Umunnachi-Afor Igwe roads in Idemili South and Dunukofia local government areas. According to him, the new minimum wage implementation will improve socio-economic status of the state and boost the state’s Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). He stressed that the economic importance of the implementation of the new minimum wage, pointing out that improved welfare of workers was top priority of his administration. Gov. Obiano, while inspecting the Eziowelle-Umunnachi-Afor Igwe roads, currently under construction, observed that some structures would be affected during the job execution. He noted that traffic congestion on the old road would be reduced, especially during festive periods, when the construction of the road would have been completed. The Governor emphasised his administration’s commitment to continue to link up communities through building of roads; urging the people of the area to support the contractors. The contractor handling the project, Mr Daniel Ekene, said the project was awarded last year. Mr. Ekene explained that they commenced with demolition of the existing drainage system, which usually caused flooding in the area, adding that they had done 1.5Km of drainage. He assured the people that the project would be completed by May.

AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic has stated that he celebrates like a ‘God’ every time he scores a goal because it makes him feel ‘alive’. Ibrahimovic said this after he scored and made history in AC Milan’s 2-0 away victory over Cagliari in the Serie A encounter on Saturday. Ibrahimovic, who re-joined AC Milan in this January’s transfer window a few days ago, netted the second goal of the encounter in the 64 minute after Rafael Leao had given the Italian giants the lead just after half time. The 38-year-old’s goal against Cagliari means he has now scored in four different decades after first scoring for Malmo against Vastra Frolunda back in 1999. “I’ll celebrate like a God at San Siro, not here,” Ibrahimovic told Sky Sport Italia. “I celebrate (like a) God every time I score, that way I feel alive! It’s important for a striker to try and be there, then sometimes it goes in, sometimes it doesn’t. “I got a few balls wrong at the start of the game, but I need a few matches to get into shape.” He added: “I feel good, the coach just wanted to think about my age and see if I needed a rest, but there’s no problem. My mind is still sharp and the body has to follow. “We played with two strikers and two wingers to push the whole team further forward, and it went well.”

Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain have reached a stand-off over a deal for Edinson Cavani, the UK Telegraph reports. PSG want to get a transfer fee for Cavani, whose current deal will expire in June. However, the Blues are only willing to pay for a loan deal. Cavani’s parents prefer a move to Atletico Madrid, although that hasn’t put off Chelsea’s chase for the Uruguayan. The player’s mother, Berta, told Spanish newspaper AS: “There is an open negotiation. PSG have rejected three proposals from Atletico but my son has asked to leave and we are waiting for an agreement to be reached by both clubs. “It’s complicated but he wants to play at Atletico, if not now, then in the summer. We have been wishing it for years but it does not now depend on my son but on PSG and Atletico. “They are not behaving well with him, [especially] with everything he has given to PSG in the near seven years he has been there.” “If you don’t use him, let him go to a club that needs your goals like Atletico Madrid.”

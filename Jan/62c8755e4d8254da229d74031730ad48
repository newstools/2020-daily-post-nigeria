US States are putting in place higher security measures following the airstrike that killed top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani. In California, Mark Ghilarducci, Homeland Security Advisor and Director of Emergency Services, said the state had strong relationships with security and intelligence departments around the US and the world, and was monitoring the situation. “At the same time, the California Cybersecurity Integration Center is working closely with its partner networks to prevent, protect against and mitigate possible cyber-attacks,” Ghilarducci said on Saturday in a ‘Statement on State Threat Assessments’. Ghilarducci, however, noted that there were currently no specific threats against the Golden State as a result of the events in the Middle East. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) on Friday urged residents to report suspicious activity to local law enforcement. “While there is no credible threat to Los Angeles, the LAPD is monitoring the events developing in Iran. “We will continue to communicate with state, local, federal and international law enforcement partners regarding any significant intelligence that may develop,” the LAPD tweeted. In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio disclosed that he was consulting with officials about steps the police department will take to protect key locations “from any attempt by Iran or its terrorist allies to retaliate against America”. The New York police commissioner, Dermot Shea, said: “NYPD continues to closely monitor the events in Iran & across the region for any further developments. “While there are no specific/credible threats to NYC, we’ve deployed additional resources to key locations. As always, if you see something, say something.”

Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri has hailed forward, Cristiano Ronaldo as a ‘champion’, following the 34-year-old’s brilliant display in his side’s Serie A 2-1 victory over Parma on Sunday. According to Sarri, the Portugal captain can create a problem for Juventus, but solves 100 of them. Ronaldo scored two goals in either half of the encounter to give Sarri’s men all three points against Parma at the Allianz Stadium. Speaking after the match, Sarri told Sky Sport Italia: “We have a champion [called Cristiano Ronaldo] who sometimes creates a problem for you but solves 100 of them. “The rest of the team has to revolve around him.” “The mental intensity can be improved, even the management of certain moments of the matches. “I don’t even like dribbling in our own half in the last few minutes. “I would prefer to concede a goal on the counter-attack than in our own penalty area. “Putting Higuain on at 2-1 was a clear message to the team: let’s end the game,” Sarri added. Juventus are now on top of the Serie A table with four points ahead of second-placed Inter Milan.

The Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) Taraba state command today (Thursday) said it rescued two abducted children in Lau Local Government Area of the State on Wednesday. The commandant, Alhaji Aliyu Ndanusa , who disclosed this to newsmen in Jalingo said the two children were abducted from their community in Askira Uba in Borno State. Ndanusa explained that men of the command got a hint about the evil act through intelligence and trailed the abductors to their hideouts in Lau. According to him, the abductors ran away on sighting the operatives of the NSCDC, leaving the two children behind. The commandant named the children as Yakubu Usman, 9 and Umaru Muhammed 7, both from Askira Uba community of Borno. “On sighting the operatives of the command, the abductors ran away while the children were rescued by our men. “We have already contacted the family and will soon reunite them with their parents,” he said. Ndanusa, who noted that there was no hiding place for criminals in Taraba, said men of the command were working tirelessly to apprehend the perpetrators. He, however, advised parents across the country to be vigilant so as to avoid a recurrence of such an ugly incident.

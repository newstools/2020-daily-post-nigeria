An Ilorin High court, Tuesday, sentenced one AbdulWahab Adebayo, to two weeks jail term in a correctional facility for receiving phone calls during court proceedings. DAILY POST reports that Justice Sikiru Oyinloye found Adebayo guilty of disturbing the court proceedings with his phone conversations. Oyinloye said that the convict distracted the court and when he was summoned by the police officer attached to the court, he refused. “The convict refused to stop disturbing the court until another policeman dragged him off the court. He also exhibited a rude attitude in court, as he shouted and claimed to be innocent. The court premises is not a commercial phone call centre where anybody can receive or make calls as they wish. “People commit contempt of court with negligence. Ignorance of the law is an offence, I hereby sentence you to two weeks imprisonment without an option of fine,” the judge ruled. Pleading for mercy, Adebayo said,” I wanted to collect money for my sick mother from my brother and could not meet him before getting to court premises, I had to make the call out of frustration,” he said.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said his aim is to challenge for the Premier League title next season, even though he admits it may not be realistic. The last time the Red Devils won the league was in 2012/2013 under Sir Alex Ferguson. Currently, United are in fifth place and 27 points off leaders, Liverpool. Last season, they finished 32 points behind eventual champions Manchester City. Ahead of his side’s visit to Anfield to face Liverpool on Sunday, Solskjaer said that catching up to the Premier League’s elite, has to be the goal. “That is the aim, of course,” Solskjaer told reporters. “I’m not saying it is a realistic one. We are behind and a fair rate behind the top one now, who we play on Sunday and we’ll see where we are against them. “But with a few signings, with the improvement these are making, in the next couple of years we want to do that. “Supporters and the club alike are not happy with not challenging for the top position in the league. That is where we feel we should be and many of today’s supporters have lived that period where we won the league consistently.”

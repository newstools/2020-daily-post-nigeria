An Akure Magistrates’ Court has sentenced two young men to one month community service. The two accused persons, Lateef Yakubu, 22, and Segun Bolarin, 22, were convicted for stealing a phone valued at N75,000. According to the charge, the convicts committed the offence on December 9, 2019 at about 11:00am at Lopsam Clinic, Akure within the jurisdiction of the court. The offence was contrary to and punishable under sections 516 and 390(9) of the Criminal Code Cap 37, Vol1, Laws of Ondo State of Nigeria 2006. The police prosecutor Inspector Uloh Goodluck, while giving the fact of the matter, said that one Esther Awosusi, complainant, came to the station with a report that on December 9, 2019 at about 11:00, that her Tecno camon 12, handset valued at N75,000 was stolen where she was charging it. “She raised alarm which attracted the owner of the clinic, while the owner of the clinic assured her of getting her phone back with the aid of the CCTV that was installed in the clinic. “Upon the reviewing of the camera, two young male unknown to the complainant were seen removing the handset alongside the charger from where it was plugged.” The duo were reportedly arrested with the help of one of the sympathizers who told them she knew the two boys in the camera. Consequently, Uloh prayed the court to convict Lateef Yakubu and Segun Bolarin, accordingly. Having gone through the case file and the statement of the convicts, the court therefore found them guilty as charged and convicted them. The Magistrate, Charity Adeyanju, therefore sentenced them to one month community service each by cutting the grasses within the court premises which should be done three times in a week.

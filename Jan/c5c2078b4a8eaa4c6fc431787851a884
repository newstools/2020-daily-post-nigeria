It was the activities of Boko Haram and Insecurity in the North that motivated Nigerians to support President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015, it was NADECO and OPC militia activities that led to Obasanjo’s Presidency in 1999, so definitely Igbos are looking for Igbo Presidency 2023, and Biafra agitation which includes South-South region is now championed by their prominent son, Alhaji Mujihad Asari Dokubo, who is the Supreme Leader of the Biafra National Council, definitely, it’s the turn of South-South region to support a Nigerian President of Igbo stock 2023 for posterity sake.”

Bayern Munich interim coach, Hansi Flick, has said he expects Jerome Boateng to remain at the club, despite strong links with Arsenal. Boateng joined the Bundesliga champions from Manchester City in 2011. However, the German began to suffer fitness problems since 2015/2016 and is yet to play more than 20 league matches in a single season since. Arsenal have emerged as a potential suitor this month, with new boss Mikel Arteta believed to be looking for defensive options. When asked again about a possible transfer, Flick suggested a move was now unlikely. “Jerome is a player of Bayern Munich and I will not concern myself with any rumours, that’s what I did the last years,” he told reporters. “Jerome came back to training well-prepared, he prepared himself on holiday. So, I am curious what the next week will bring. “But I will not concern myself with thoughts if he will leave the club or not. He didn’t say anything regarding that and we are constantly in an exchange. “We have to see how these things develop, but right now I cannot picture it [Boateng leaving].”

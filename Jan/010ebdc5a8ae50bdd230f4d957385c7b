The Federal Government has maintained that it is winning the war against corruption in Nigeria. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, made the declaration while rubbishing the report by the Transparency International, TI, corruption index which ranked Nigeria 146 of 180 countries, with a total of 26 points out of a possible 100 points. Speaking in London yesterday, the Minister explained that the federal government was fighting against corruption in order to see to the development of Nigeria. He said: “In any event, we are not fighting corruption because we want to impress any organisation. We are fighting corruption because we believed that without fighting the menace, the much-sought development will not happen and we have results to show for fighting corruption. “We have put in place policies and legislation that have tamed the monster called corruption. For instance, apart from the TSA which has saved us billions of Naira, we put in place transparency portal which enables every Nigerians to see how much is being spent by government every day. “Under the transparency portal regulation, any expenditure above N5 billion must be reported and that gives every Nigerian the opportunity to know exactly what is going on. “We will continue to fight corruption and we know that we are winning the war.”

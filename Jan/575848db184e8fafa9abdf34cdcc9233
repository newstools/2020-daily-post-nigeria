The Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, has stated that the Biafran war would have been averted if the Federal Government of Nigeria had complied with the Aburi Accord. The BNYL blamed the inability of the former Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon, to implement the Aburi agreement and his refusal to stop the killing of Easterners as the remote cause of the war. The group stated this in a statement to DAILY POST on Tuesday signed by its Chief Press Secretary, Richard Odung. They accused western elites of misleading Gowon, adding, “the westerners contributed immensely to the war, it would have been averted but they misled Gowon to reject what he accepted before Kwame Nkrumah and other world observers. “The war wouldn’t have occurred if the Aburi was implemented.” The group added that “some people of the Niger Delta who were used as an instrument to frustrate the Government of the East are today clamoring for what was agreed in Aburi.” BNYL said it was reacting to the 50 years anniversary of the Biafran war which claimed the lives of 1.2 million Nigerians. It debunked claims that the first coup resulted to the war, adding, “[We] don’t believe it was because of the first coup, yes an Igboman from Delta State was the leader of the coup but there are some other persons in the North and West who were part of that coup as history recorded. “Even at that, the Easterners controlled the Nigerian Army as of then, and they were not happy with the way the Prime Minister was going about his appointments and policymaking without consulting the ceremonial President, Nnamdi Azikiwe.” The group recalled the Kano riot in 1956 during the constitutional conference, the killing of easterners did not start immediately after the first coup. BNYL advised the Buhari government not to repeat the mistakes of Gowon by thinking that the use of force will end the demands for a sovereign state of Biafra.

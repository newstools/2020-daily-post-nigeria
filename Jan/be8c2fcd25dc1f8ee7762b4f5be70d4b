Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, was left unimpressed with VAR, as they were held to a 0-0 draw at Watford on Saturday. Spurs goalkeeper, Paulo Gazzaniga, saved a penalty from Troy Deeney, before Erik Lamela saw his effort just scrambled off the line. After the match, Mourinho told BBC Sport: “We played very well. We started the game without a striker but with lots of offensive players. “We had the control of the game, especially in the first half, We arrived in dangerous positions, we created chances but we did not manage to score. “I am happy with how we played, our commitment. I think the result is unfair, I think it would have been more unfair if we lost. “We are not good at adapting to this style of football. We were quite difficult to play.” On the VAR decisions, he added: “They did not discuss that one that should have been a penalty and then they looked at one that was clearly not. That’s also alongside the red cards that should have been. “Very bad decisions. I love goal-line technology, I respect that.”

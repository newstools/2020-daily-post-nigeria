The mastermind of the foiled robbery of First bank in the Mpape area of Abuja has been arrested. The suspect is being held at the FCT Command Headquarters by old CBN building, Garki, Abuja. Ernest, a barman, was arrested at his hideout by police detectives, the Nation reports. DAILY POST recalls that a Customer Service Officer with First Bank at Mpape, Abuja, Larry Ehizo had narrated how he helped robbers gain access to the bank. He and others were paraded by the FCT Police command for the operation foiled by a combined team of police and soldiers. In his confession, Ehizo claimed that one Ernest (still at large), threatened to kill him, his girlfriend and his family if he did not ensure the robbery took place. The 30-year-old graduate of Political Science from the University of Abuja had worked with First Bank.

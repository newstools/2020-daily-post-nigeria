Speaking after completing his move to Southampton, Walker told the club’s official website: “I had a chat with the manager and he assured me I was the type of player he liked and I got that feeling from watching Southampton that I could fit in well. “I come here looking to help the club improve and improve myself. I just want to win as many games as possible and enjoy playing football.” Reacting, Southampton manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl said: “It was clear this month that we could use additional support in the full-back positions, and Kyle was exactly the profile of player I was hoping we could bring in,” said Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhüttl. “He will be a good addition to our squad, and we are pleased that he has chosen to join us ahead of a number of other clubs who were interested in signing him.” Walker, 22, made 24 first-team appearances for Spurs, but has only featured once since Jose Mourinho took charge in November.

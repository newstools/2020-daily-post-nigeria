Ugwumba Uche Nwosu, former governorship candidate of Action Alliance during 2019 election in Imo State, has stated that the emergence of Senator Hope Uzodinma as new Imo Governor following the recent Supreme Court verdict that removed Hon. Emeka Ihedioha from the seat has unified APC in the state. Nwosu, who recently returned to the governing All Progressives Congress (APC), stated this while interacting with newsmen on Friday afternoon in Owerri, the Imo state capital. This was made known in a press statement issued by Jones Onwusoanya, Director, Media and Publicity of Nwosu’s 2019 campaign Organization and made available to DAILY POST. Nwosu, however, restated his resolve to contribute whatever he can to the progress of Governor Hope Uzodimma administration as well as towards revitalizing the party,APC. “I did not run for governorship of Imo out of desperation, but out of my motivation to render service to the people of Imo State and make life more prosperous and fulfilling for them. Now that His Excellency, Senator Hope Uzodimma is there, I believe, he will do his best to implement the progressive manifestoes and people oriented ideologies of our Party. “What we all owe him is our support and whenever my input is needed, I will happily make my inputs without reservations. I and indeed all my followers and supporters are looking into the future with assurances of a brighter hope for Imo State. “If for nothing else, the emergence of Senator Hope Uzodinma has reenergized the party and brought all members of the APC in Imo State on the same page.” The APC chieftain, therefore, urged all Imo stakeholders to bury their hatchets and buy into the vision of the new governor towards helping the State move forward.

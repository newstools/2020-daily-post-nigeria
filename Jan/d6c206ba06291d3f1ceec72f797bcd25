The White House has formally informed the House of Representatives about the drone attack that killed Qassem Soleimani. This is amid complaints from the Democrats that President Donald Trump did not notify legislators or seek approval for the attack. The classified notification from the White House was sent under a 1973 US law called the War Powers Act. The War Power Act requires the legislative to notify Congress within 48 hours of committing armed forces to military action or imminent actions. House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said it raised more questions than it answered. “This document prompts serious and urgent questions about the timing, manner and justification of the Administration’s decision to engage in hostilities against Iran,” Pelosi said in a statement on Saturday, according to Al Jazeera. The Speaker added that the “highly unusual” decision to classify the entire document compounded her concerns and “suggests that the Congress and the American people are being left in the dark about our national security.”

Iranian Information and Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi has described US President Donald Trump as “a terrorist in a suit” Azari-Jahromi further compared Trump to the Islamic State in Syria, ISIS, Hitler, and Genghis. He said on Sunday in response to Trump’s earlier tweets where the American leader threatened to target 52 sites in Iran if the Middle East country attacks US assets or citizens. The Minister, however, boasted that no one can defeat “the great Iranian nation.” Jahromi tweeted, “Like ISIS, Like Hitler, Like Genghis! They all hate cultures. Trump is a terrorist in a suit. “He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat ‘the Great Iranian Nation & Culture’ #HardRevenge#QasemSoleimani.” Trump had taken to Twitter to warn that his country had “targeted 52 Iranian sites.” He said some of the sites were “at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.” “The USA wants no more threats!”

Sporting Lisbon manager, Jorge Manuel Silas has responded to report linking his star midfielder, Bruno Fernandes with a move to Manchester United this month. DAILY POST had reported that Manchester United have reportedly offered defender, Marcos Rojo and 60million euros to Sporting Lisbon for their star player, Fernandes. Asked to comment on Man United’s pursuit of Fernandes, Silas was quoted by Metro UK as telling reporters following his side’s 3-1 win over Setubal on Saturday: “I can’t guarantee any of these things because I don’t know. “I’m already thinking about the game with Benfica [on Friday] and I’m thinking about using him.” “Bruno is a huge player and all players like him have a lot of market. “I don’t like to think about that, but I’ll be thinking of alternatives in case Bruno leaves. I hope it doesn’t happen, but we have to start thinking about that,” he added.

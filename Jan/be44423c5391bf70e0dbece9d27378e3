President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad has congratulated the people of Kano State over the victory of Governor Umar Ganduje at the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court had on Monday affirmed the election of Ganduje as governor of the state. This was after the apex court dismissed the appeal and cross-appeal instituted by Alhaji Abba Kabiru Yusuf, gubernatorial candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Delivering judgment, Justice Sylvester Ngwuta declared that the grounds of the two appeals brought by the appellant were dismissed for lack of merit. He added that the grounds of the appeals were blanket in law, unproved and could not accommodate all infractions of the electoral process. Reacting to the ruling, Ahmad in a tweet wrote: “The Supreme Court has dismissed the appeal by Abba Kabiru Yusuf of PDP challenging the election of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in the March 9, 2019 governorship election. “Congratulations to good people of Kano, Congratulations to all members of our great party, APC.”

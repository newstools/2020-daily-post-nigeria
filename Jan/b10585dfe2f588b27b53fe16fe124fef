Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has reacted to his side’s goalless draw with Watford in the Premier League on Saturday at Vicarage Road. The Portuguese also said that if it is possible, Spurs will sign a new striker this January transfer window following Harry Kane’s long term injury. “Good game, they fought hard for their point and we fought for more, but the technology that I love and respect in the game, the goal line technology, never makes a mistake. By one centimetre, maybe one millimetre, we didn’t win but full respect to the goal line technology. I got used to, from the beginning, to respect it and I don’t even have emotion because I wait for goal or not goal and carry on. So just unlucky there, but that’s what it is,” Mourinho said at his post-match press conference as quoted by Football London after the game. “We started well, we played well and we finished well. It’s not easy to come here and play with a team that is not physical but is just technical. Apart from the defenders we played with Winks, Lo Celso, Dele, Lamela, Lucas, Son.” Mourinho added “If it’s possible yes Tottenham will buy a striker, if it’s not no. We all want the best for the club but it has to be when it’s possible to do and right to do. This is not the last match of Tottenham history, we have another on Wednesday and many next season. We must be calm.” Mourinho’s side will now battle Norwich City on Wednesday in their next Premier League fixture.

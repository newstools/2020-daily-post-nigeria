An Ilorin High Court, Wednesday, convicted seven persons for allegedly trafficking, selling, buying and poseessing human parts for money rituals. Justice Durosiloun Kawu, who delivered the judgement, found them guilty of such offences as criminal conspiracy, trafficking and posession of 11 human skulls, 11 lower jaw bones, bunch of hair and 29 pieces of bones taken from various burial grounds in Ilorin. The offences were reportedly committed in March 2017 in Ilorin. Delivering judgement, Justice Kawu, described the activities of the convicts as despicable and shameful and sentenced the first convict, Azeez Yakubu, to 15 years imprisonment, with N100,000 fine each on three counts, which he said would run concurrently. Other convicts, Aishat Yinusa, Lukman Saka, Abdulganiyu Bamdele, Ahmed Yahaya, Salihu Ayinde and Abdulrasak Babamale were sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with N100,000 fine each on two counts that would run concurrently. Justice Kawu also said that the prison terms would include period already spent in prison custody, adding that “they were free to appeal the judgement.” Justice Kawu had earlier in his judgement overruled that the convicts were tortured by SARS operatives in Abuja to extract information contained in their written statements, describing the defence as unreasonable and inconsistent,while also affirming that the evidence found on the convicts were not part of animals, but those of human beings. DAILY POST reports that the head of Pathology Department, UNILORIN Teaching Hospital, Dr. Kazeem Ibrahim was invited to ascertain that the parts were human parts.

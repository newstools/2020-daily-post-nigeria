The entrances to the Supreme Court, Monday, witnessed uncommon security arrangement as the apex court is set to deliver guber appeal judgments in the heavily politicised Sokoto and Kano states. DAILY POST observed that from the main entrance to the Villa gate, there are scores of armed security personnel turning back most vehicles and individuals going to the apex court for today’s judgements. The heavily tensed atmosphere and presence of security agents almost everywhere even subjected many people, including various party stalwarts and journalists to trudging a long distance to the court premises. Also, at the forecourt is stationed an Armoured Personnel vehicle manned by armed and stern looking policemen. At each checkpoint, many journalists, politicians and members of different support political groups are thoroughly interrogated and checked enroute the court. It is even a tough struggle to enter the hallowed courtroom as many people are being shoved down and trampled as security dogs were unleashed. Lawyers are not free from the hectic time but the courtroom is almost getting set for judicial activity in anticipation of the arrival of the 7-man panel of the apex court. While Kano and Sokoto states await in anxiety for their judgements, Bauchi and Plateau states guber appeals were scheduled for hearing today. It is noteworthy, however, that today’s judgements will either reduce or heighten the, hitherto, political controversies in the northern part of the country arising from the 2019 general elections.

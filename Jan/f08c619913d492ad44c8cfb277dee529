Properties worth millions of naira were on Saturday destroyed in a fire incident in the hilly town of Idanre, the headquarters of Idanre Local Government Area of Ondo State. With no lives lost in the inferno, a furniture factory, textile store, phone shops as well as a nursery and primary school were all consumed by the fire. Though the cause of the inferno could not be ascertained as of press time, some residents who spoke with our correspondent said it could be as a result of power surge in one of the affected shops. One of the victims and owner of the furniture workshop, Oluwatobi Atere who was overwhelmed with grief said he had lost property close to thirty million naira. A community leader in Idanre, Adesoji Abiodun, who assisted in putting out the fire lamented the late arrival of men of the fire service. Abiodun added that the level of destruction would have been minimal had the fire brigade responded early enough. Reacting, the Owa of Idanre, Oba Frederick Aroloye, consoled the victims of the fire incident even as he called for the establishment of a fire station in the community.

Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, has said there is every chance Kelechi Iheanacho could return to Manchester City. Iheanacho has enjoyed a resurgence under Rogers and has impressed for the Foxes in his last few appearances. The Nigerian forward has spent three years at the King Power and has two more left on his deal, which includes a buy-back clause. “I’m not totally sure, but these things usually last the course of the first deal he signs. “So, Iheanacho joined on a five-year contract in 2017, so leading to 2022. “Even if he negotiates an extended deal in that time, I’d expect the buy-back clause to still be applicable until 2022,” Rogers told Leicester Mercury.

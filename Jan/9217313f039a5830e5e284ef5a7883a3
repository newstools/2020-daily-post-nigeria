Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hailed Nemanja Matic following the 1-0 win at Manchester City in their Carabao Cup semi-final second leg on Wednesday. Matic scored the only goal of the game and was sent off for two bookable offences by referee Kevin Friend. Solskjaer, speaking with Sky Sports after the match, slammed Friend for the decision and perceived inconsistency with failing to punish City. “Of course it’s hard to go here and score a goal here with eleven, let alone ten. “He [Matic] was Man of the Match. Never a sending off. Absolute, for me, a joke. It’s ironic really that he gets a yellow card for his first foul, almost gets a yellow for his second which wasn’t a foul, and yes the last one is a yellow card but nowhere near us. “How many times did they foul us? How many times was Dan James fouled? In the first half, Jesse. “For me, it shouldn’t be like this because I’m so proud of the players, they’ve beaten City now twice in six weeks at their place. We’ve come so far with these boys. They’ve given us absolutely everything,” Solskjaer said.

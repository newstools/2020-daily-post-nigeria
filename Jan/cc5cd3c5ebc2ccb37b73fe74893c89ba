Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has heaped praises on the club’s new signing, Takumi Minamino, after he made his debut in the Reds’ FA Cup 1-0 victory against Everton on Sunday. Klopp described Minamino’s performance against Carlos Ancelotti’s men as ‘super, outstanding and exactly the player Liverpool wished for’. A second half goal from Curtis Jones ensured Klopp’s men defeated the Toffees at Anfield. Speaking on Minamino’s display against Everton after the match, Klopp was quoted by Liverpool Echo as saying at post-match: “He was super, outstanding, exactly the player we wanted, exactly the player we wished for. “In your first game for a team you don’t know, it’s not a settled team, it’s already difficult, this team we threw together on the pitch with basically two sessions together, to show this sort of understanding, his football skills were exceptional and his attitude was outstanding. “He didn’t look tired, but we don’t know the player that well yet, so we took him off.” Minamino joined Liverpool from Red Bull Salzburg for £7.25million.

Barcelona have made an enquiry about signing Christian Eriksen from Tottenham, before the January transfer window closes, according to Sky Sports. Eriksen met with Spurs chairman Daniel Levy on Tuesday and reiterated that he wants to join Inter Milan this month. Inter are still pushing hard to get the deal done, but it now appears as though Barca have entered the race for his signature. Although Inter and Spurs have not agreed on a fee, Eriksen has sorted out personal terms with the Serie A side. Eriksen’s contract expires at the end of the season and he has been free to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs since January 1. Inter Milan’s chief-executive, Giuseppe Marotta, is optimistic the two clubs can agree a deal for Eriksen this month. “Eriksen is a fantastic player. We’re waiting and we’re still confident in this deal,” he said.

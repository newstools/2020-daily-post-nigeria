Manchester City striker, Sergio Aguero, has broken Thierry Henry’s Premier League record for the most goals scored by a foreign player. Aguero netted a hat-trick on Sunday, as City hammered Aston Villa 6-1. The Argentina international now has 177 goals in the competition. The 31-year-old now sits joint-fourth in the list of all-time Premier League goalscorers, behind Andy Cole, Wayne Rooney and record goalscorer Alan Shearer. Victory for Manchester City means Pep Guardiola’s side have leapfrogged Leicester City into second place. The champions have also closed the gap on leaders Liverpool to 14 points.

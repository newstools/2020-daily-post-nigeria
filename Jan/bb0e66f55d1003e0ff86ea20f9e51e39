Paris Saint-Germain boss, Thomas Tuchel has demised report linking his left-back, Layvin Kurzawa with a move to Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal this January transfer window. DAILY POST had reported that Arsenal have spoken with Kurzawa, but are not the only European club interested in the left-back. The 27-year-old left-back is into the final six months of his contract with PSG and will not sign a new deal. However, Arsenal are ready to snap him up in January, rather than wait until the summer. With Kieran Tierney and Sead Kolasinac both injured, the Premier League side is keen on Kurzawa’s low fee and the idea that he could be revived by a new challenge. But, Tuchel is now saying that PSG needs Kurzawa in case first-choice left-back, Juan Bernat suffer an injury. “I haven’t spoken with Layvin or anyone else about his departure this winter,” Tuchel told a news conference ahead of PSG’s clash with Lorient in the Coupe de France on Sunday as quoted by Goal. “Layvin is number two behind [Juan] Bernat in the left-back position. We need him and Layvin will play tomorrow (Sunday) against Lorient.”

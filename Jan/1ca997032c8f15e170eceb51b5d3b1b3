Manchester City striker, Gabriel Jesus, has vowed to reclaim penalty duties, after being axed by manager Pep Guardiola following a series of misses. Jesus’ failure against Sheffield United was his third of the season. Guardiola then appointed Ilkay Gundogan to take the spot-kick in the FA Cup tie with Fulham on Saturday. Gundogan converted an early penalty during the 4-0 win after Jesus had been brought down by Fulham defender, Tim Ream. “Normally the manager puts on the paper in the dressing room before the game who are the penalty takers, last game I was the penalty taker and here normally I am the taker but today it’s Gundo,” Jesus told reporters. “That’s football. Sometimes you have to stop, improve and come back strong. “In the training sessions I take them and I score more than I miss. “If I take five I miss one and sometimes I don’t miss. In games, it’s been different. I’ve taken three this season – two here and one with the national team Brazil – and I missed all three. “When you miss three in a row you go to the next one under pressure to score. So that’s the challenge. I have in my mind that I have to train more and improve more of course.”

Tottenham Hotspur playmaker, Christian Eriksen has agreed on a personal term with Inter Milan to join Antonio Conte’s men in this January’s transfer window, according to Sky Sport Italia. Inter have now entered into talks with Spurs in a bid to finalise a transfer fee for Eriksen. The Serie A giants have made an offer of £8.5million for the midfielder, but Tottenham are holding out for a fee closer to £17million and discussion between the two clubs could continue until the end of the month. Eriksen’s current deal at Spurs will expire at the end of the season. The Denmark international has been linked with a move to Manchester United and Inter Milan in the past few weeks. The 27-year-old has scored 69 goals in over 300 appearances for Jose Mourinho’s side since joining the club from Ajax in 2013.

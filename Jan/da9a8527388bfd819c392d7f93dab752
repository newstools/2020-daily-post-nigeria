Liverpool boss, Jurgen Klopp, has confirmed that his side will be without three key players; Naby Keita, Dejan Lovren and James Milner when they take on Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday evening at Anfield due to injuries. He also said that Fabinho and Joel Matip could feature against Ole Gunnar Solskjaser’s side after training with the Reds’ teammates on Thursday. Klopp’s men head to the game following a 1-0 victory over Tottenham in their last encounter. “Yes, it looks like Joel and Fabinho [will be back],” Klopp said as quoted by Liverpool’s official website as telling reporters at his pre-match conference on Friday. “They trained completely normally yesterday and the day before. So that means they are likely to be in the squad. “The other three [Naby Keita, Dejan Lovren and James Milner] not, but they are getting closer and closer. Dejan, I think, will train 100 per cent from Monday on. “With the other two [Keita and Milner], I don’t know exactly. I cannot rush it so when somebody tells me they are ready, I take them back in training.” The kick-off time for the match is 5:30pm.

Leeds winger, Ezgjan Alioski, has warned Arsenal that his side can beat the current Manchester United squad ahead of both side’s FA Cup third-round fixture tonight. Arsenal will host Leeds on Monday night at the Emirates Stadium but Alioski believes his side will have no fear against Mikel Arteta’s men, adding that they are capable of beating the Gunners in front of their home supporters. “You have some players who think like this, but it’s not enough to think “Wow, it’s Arsenal,” because we are also a good team and we want to show it,” Alioski said as quoted by Metro UK. “We need to go there with a lot of confidence like we always do and to play like we always do. “Not to be scared to go there. ‘I see the result versus Manchester United, but this United, even we can beat them. This is a cup, it’s different. “The difference is that they’re [Arsenal] in the Premier League, we are in the Championship, and it’s nice to go there and show them who is Leeds. “If we are in the Premier League, Leeds are going to be one of the biggest clubs, like I know they were before.”

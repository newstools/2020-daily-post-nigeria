Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has said Anthony Martial is “not quite good enough” to play for the club. Martial missed a great chance to equalize for the Red Devils, with Liverpool leading 1-0 at Anfield on Sunday. The France forward surged through on goal but blasted a glorious opportunity high and wide. It proved to be United’s best opportunity of the match, with Mohamed Salah putting the game to bed in added time. “Martial has come to Man Utd and the big strikers score in the big moments, but his miss [in the second half] sums up is career at Man Utd,” Keant told Sky Sports. “Excellent build-up play, but you have to hit the target. No excuses. “The big strikers who are remembered by the supporters hit the target and the back of the net, and that’s why that guy [Martial] is not quite good enough for Man Utd. That moment summed him up.”

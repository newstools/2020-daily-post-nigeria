Germany has condemned Iranian missile attacks on Iraqi bases housing US and other coalition military. Germany, through its Defence Minister, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, called on Iran to end a “spiral” of conflict. “The German government strongly condemns this aggression,” Kramp-Karrenbauer told broadcaster ARD, according to Al Jazeera. “It is now crucial that we do not allow this spiral to continue,” she said, adding that “it is now primarily up to the Iranians to refrain from further escalation”. According to the Minister, she would seek a meeting of the coalition’s 13 framework nations to discuss the situation in the region. Following the assassination of Qassem Soleimani, an Iranian army General, there have been heightened tensions in the Middle East after US President gave reasons for his administration’s action. Iran had vowed severe retaliation. More than a dozen rockets were fired at two Iraqi military bases hosting US troops on Wednesday. The retaliation began yesterday when Multiple missiles were launched at Iraq from Iran targeting American military facilities. A Ukrainian Boeing-737 with 180 people on board also crashed in Iran on Wednesday.

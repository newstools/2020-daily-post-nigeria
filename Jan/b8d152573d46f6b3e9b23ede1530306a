Liverpool are likely to end Taiwo Awoniyi’s loan at Mainz this month, Goal reports. Awoniyi moved to Germany last summer, but has made just six appearances for the Bundesliga strugglers. The Nigerian striker has managed to play only 150 minutes in total this season. And with Mainz’s first-choice striker, Jean-Philippe Mateta, having returned to action just before the winter break, it is anticipated that Awoniyi will find it even harder to get regular football in the second half of the campaign. Liverpool have the option to terminate the loan agreement, but will not do so unless a clear opportunity for game-time arises. Awoniyi is believed to be attracting interest from clubs like Olympiakos, Montpellier, Brest and Nimes. Turkish outfit, Besiktas and La Liga duo Leganes and Real Mallorca have also made enquiries. The Nigeria Under-23 international joined the Reds in 2015, but has since spent his time out on loan, with the club unable to secure a UK work permit.

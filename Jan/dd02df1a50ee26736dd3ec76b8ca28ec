The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) said it has charged the driver, who reportedly knocked down one of its officials to court for prosecution. DAILY POST reported yesterday that a driver was arrested by the FRSC for allegedly knocking down one of its officials on Tuesday around Sagamu Interchange, Ogun State. According to the Ogun FRSC spokesperson, Florence Okpe, the “FRSC Marshal on duty was knocked down by the reckless driver who drove a Toyota Camry car, with registration number, KRD836FT.” Updating DAILY POST earlier today, Okpe said, “the reckless driver of the ash-coloured Toyota Camry Car with registration number KRD836FT, has been charged to court. “The driver on Tuesday 07 January 2020 around the Sagamu Interchange knocked down an FRSC Operative while on patrol, after being stopped for violating a traffic infraction but in a desperate attempt to escape, knocked down the Marshal. “The instrumentality of the National Vehicle Identification Scheme were deployed to track the driver who initially escaped by running away, though abandoned his vehicle. Okpe informed that two road crashes occurred in Ogun yesterday, adding that no life was lost in the accidents. “Motorists should plan their journies to accommodate additional travel time at the various construction zones where road lanes have narrowed, due to the construction activities of the major construction companies rehabilitating the Benin-Ore-Ijebu Ode-Sagamu and the Lagos-Ibadan Expressways,”she said.

Manchester City have been handed a major boost ahead of their Carabao Cup semi-final clash with Manchester United on Tuesday night. The Premier League champions could feature defenders, Nicolas Otamendi and Aymeric Laporte when they take on the Red Devils at Old Trafford. Man City manager, Pep Guardiola has confirmed that both Otamendi and Laporte have returned from injury. “It’s good [to have Laporte back in training],” Guardiola told the club’s official website on Monday. “Everyone apart from Leroy is training. Nico is back. We have an almost full squad. It’s good.” Guardiola added: “It was important in the first season and the next two and this one. Nothing has changed. “With that theory, in the seasons we won the Premier League, it wouldn’t matter. That’s not the case. It’s a game we want to play and do well. “It’s a semi-final. When you play games against your opponent for many years sometimes you win and sometimes you lose. Against a top club like United, you can win and lose games. “I didn’t expect when I arrived here that I would win all the time against Manchester United. We’ve beaten them more than we’ve lost, especially last season when we beat them all the time. “The derby in Spain was Espanyol and Real Madrid and here United are the derby. “The derby in the city is important for our fans, but the other top teams are important. I know exactly what it means to the fans.” Man City head to the game after defeating Port Vale 4-1 in the FA Cup over the weekend, while Man United played a goalless draw with Wolves. The kick-off time for the match is 9pm.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ebonyi State chapter, on Monday, blocked the entrance of the Federal High Court sitting in Abakaliki as they protested along major streets of the state over the sack of the former governor of Imo State, Chief Emeka Ihedioha. The party, however, gave the Nigerian Supreme Court 24 hours to reverse the judgement it delivered on the Imo State governorship election. Speaking to journalists in Abakaliki, shortly after the protest, the south east zonal chairman, Austin Umahi, said the declaration of Hope Uzodinma as the governor of Imo State was a rape of democracy. Recall that the Supreme Court had last week sacked Governor Emeka Ihedioha of the PDP as Governor of Imo State and declared Hope Uzodinma of APC as the winner of the election. But, the judgement has been trailed by controversy and protest across the country. However, the protest was carried out by over one thousands party faithful in the state, who marched around the city to protest what they described as injustice and a rape on the democracy in the country. They were carrying placards with the following inscriptions “NJC must act now”, Imo Guber case: Supreme Court must revisit judgement, Ihedioha must return as Imo State governor, Save Democracy in Nigeria, Judiciary is now the lost hope of the common man,” et al. They all wore black attire to signify that they were in a state of grief over the judgement. According to Umahi, “We are giving them 24 hours to reverse the judgment or else Nigeria will never remain the same. If they don’t reverse the judgment, then democracy has been murdered in Nigeria,” he said. Also responding, the state chairman of PDP, Barr. Onyekachi Nwabonyi, condemned the ruling by the apex court, adding that the judgment has turned the judiciary, which is the last hope of the common man into a lost hope of the common man.

Nice captain, Patrick Vieira, has said there was no chance of him replacing Unai Emery at Arsenal, as he and Nice are “100 per cent” committed to one another. The former Gunners captain Vieira has been linked with the Gunners job since Arsene Wenger’s departure in 2018. Instead, the club chose Mikel Arteta after Emery was sacked in November 2019. Vieira insists there were no talks with Arsenal on this occasion, although the Nice coach is adamant he would have turned down any offer regardless. “No, but there is no place in my mind to have those kind of conversations,” Vieira told the Daily Mail. “My focus is here [at Nice]. This project suits who I am and what I want to achieve. “This rumour about the Arsenal job is not something that bothered me. I don’t know what the future holds but that is why I don’t want to put my brain somewhere that doesn’t exist. “This club knows I want to stay and I know they want me to stay, 100 per cent.”

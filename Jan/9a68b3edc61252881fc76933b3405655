A former Military Head of State, General Yakubu Gowon has urged Nigerians to ensure they avert another civil war in Nigeria. Gowon said leaders and citizens must create enabling platforms for dialogue and proffer ideas on how to live together in peace and harmony for the good of all. He spoke yesterday during the Never Again Conference organised by the Nzuko Umunna and Ndigbo Lagos in conjunction with Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) to mark 50 years of the end of the Nigerian civil war. The former Military ruler said the commitment of Nigerians to the country must be total and patriotic. He said: “We must do all in our power as responsible leaders and citizens of this great country and nation to create enabling platforms for dialogue and proffer ideas on how we can live together in peace and harmony for the good of all Nigerians and the black race as a whole, thus ensuring political, economic, security and development of the country. “I urge all Nigerians to ensure that we avert another civil war in Nigeria.” DAILY POST had reported that Pat Utomi, Professor of Political Economics and former presidential candidate, at the same event had insisted that Nigeria won’t be in existence if the Biafra Civil war was fought in the present day. Utomi had explained that Nigeria may not exist if Biafra was fought today due to the recognition given by the international community to self-determination.

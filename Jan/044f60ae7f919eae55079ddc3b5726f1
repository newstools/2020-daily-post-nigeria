Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hit back at Robin van Persie following his comments after their 2-0 defeat to Arsenal on New Year’s Day. After the game, Van Persie hit out at Solskjaer for smiling during his post-match interview. When asked about the Dutchman’s comments before United’s FA Cup clash against Wolves on Saturday, Solskjaer told a press conference: “I don’t know Robin and Robin doesn’t know me. “He probably doesn’t have a right to criticise my management style and I won’t change. That’s definite. “Yeah, Robin, he took my No.20 [shirt] and that’s probably all he’s going to take from me as well. “Because I’m not in medieval times.”

Canadian Prime Minister has reacted following Iran’s admission that its military actually downed the Ukranian international airline killing all 176 passengers and crew on Wednesday. Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau said his government expects the “full cooperation” of Iranian authorities in investigating the downing of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752. The jetliner, a Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines and carrying mostly Iranians and Canadian-Iranians went down on the outskirts of Tehran during takeoff just hours after Iran launched a barrage of missiles at US forces in Iraq. Of the 176 people who were killed, 57 were Canadian nationals. Nearly 140 passengers on board were scheduled to take a connecting flight from Kiev to Canada. Trudeau’s statement, “Tonight, Iran acknowledged that Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was shot down by its own armed forces. “Our focus remains closure, accountability, transparency, and justice for the families and loved ones of the victims. This is a national tragedy, and all Canadians are mourning together. “We will continue working with our partners around the world to ensure a complete and thorough investigation, and the Canadian government expects full cooperation from Iranian authorities.”

The Kano State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has reacted to the Supreme Court ruling affirming Umar Ganduje winner of the last governorship election in the state. Kano State Chairman of PDP, Rabiu Sulaiman Bichi said the party has accepted the judgment of the Supreme Court in good faith. Recall that the Supreme Court had dismissed the appeal and cross-appeal instituted by Alhaji Abba Kabiru Yusuf, the gubernatorial candidate of PDP while affirming Ganduje’s election. Delivering judgment, Justice Sylvester Ngwuta declared that the grounds of the two appeals brought by the appellant were dismissed for lack of merit. He added that the grounds of the appeals were blanket in law, unproved and could not accommodate all infractions of the electoral process. However, Bichi also urged PDP supporters to remain calm and steadfast and not to engage in any form of crisis. Addressing newsmen, Bichi stressed the need for party supporters to maintain the peace for the development of the state and country at large. He also urged them to remain steadfast and not engage in any form of crisis. “My call to our supporters is for them to remain calm over the recent development. “Let us put hands together to move our party forward,” he said. He said that the party had accepted the verdict that affirmed Ganduje as duly elected governor of the state. “We thank the Almighty Allah for the current situation. “As you know we were at the High Court where the decision was not in our favour and we went for appeal, there too it was not in our favour. We then exploited the final option and went to the Supreme Court. “We have accepted the final judgment in good faith and we will forge ahead to move our party forward,” Sulaiman-Bichi said.

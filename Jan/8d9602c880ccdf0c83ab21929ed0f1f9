Three children of the same parents were in the early hours of Friday burnt to death at their residence situated at the last bust stop, behind Ibadan Grammar School, Molete, Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. The names of the deceased children are Glory, 14 year old, Samuel, 8 year old and Darasimi 3 year old. DAILY POST gathered that the incident was said to have occurred when their father, Mr. Tunde Emmanuel and mother, Christiana, were not around. One of the parents, before living the house, reportedly locked the door to the room with padlock from outside, which prevented the children from opening the door and probably escape when the fire started. As gathered, the fire incident began few minutes to 1:00am on Friday, and also razed some of the other rooms in the eight-room face-to-face building. A night guard in the area was said to have raised the alarm and alerted people in the community to the inferno. Though the cause of the fire incident has not been ascertained, sources said it began as a result of spark from electricity supply, while other sources said candle might have been responsible for the fire outbreak. When journalists visited the scene of the fire incident on Friday, two single-face gas cookers that had been razed were sighted. The police, according to sources, had evacuated the remains of the three deceased children. The people living in the same building with the family reportedly made efforts to rescue the trapped children, but the fire was heavily burning in the room and was accompanied with heavy smoke. One of the occupants of the building, whose room also got burnt, Adeola spoke with journalists. Adeola said, “We were all sleeping when the night guards called our attention to the fire incident from outside around few minutes to 1:00 a.m. We were shocked and we ran for safety only to realise that the children of Mr Tunde and Mrs Christianah Emmanuel; Glory, Samuel and the youngest Darasimi, were locked inside their room. “Then, people made efforts to rescue them and somehow quench the fire with water. But this was not enough as the fire kept on blaring. Glory attempted to escape and possibly rescue his other siblings, but the door was locked from outside with a big padlock. “As much as neighbours attempted to rescue them, they were kept away by the force of the fire before things turned awry. The water we were trying to use seemed like fuelling it the more. “The fire fighters had difficulties getting here because most gates leading to this area had been locked. So, it was tasking getting here on time, though their efforts with two trucks of water eventually quenched it.” Father of the deceased children, Mr. Emmanuel was said to have been on a night duty in the neighbourhood, while the mother, sources said, was also on a night duty in her place of work. The father reportedly got information about the fire outbreak where he was and rushed to his residence. On getting there, he was told that his three children had been burnt to death and he reportedly ran away immediately and nobody knew his whereabouts at the time of filling this report. Police Public Relations Officer in the state, Mr. Olugbenga Fadeyi, confirmed the incident. Fadeyi said, “On 3rd January 2020, at the early hours, there was a fire incident at No 6, Orisunbare street, Eyin Grammar Ibadan where three children, Glory Emmanuel, female, aged 14 years; Samuel Emmanuel, male, aged eight years; and Darasimi Emmanuel, female, aged three years of the same mother were burnt to death in a eight-room apartment. “The police have commenced investigation as to the cause of the fire incident.”

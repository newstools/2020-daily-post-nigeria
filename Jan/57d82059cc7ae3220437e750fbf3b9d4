The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) on Monday appealed to Muslim youths in the country to exercise restraint over the death of top Iranian military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in Iraq. In a statement issued in Abuja by Head of Media of the council, Ibrahim Aselemi, the body appealed to the youth not to allow their emotions becloud their judgment but to ensure peace at all times, NAN reports. NSCIA said the issue between the U.S. and Iran can only be resolved through diplomatic dialogue. “The attention of NSCIA has been drawn to a planned peaceful protest by some Muslim youths in the country to vent their anger over the killing of Iranian top military commander, Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq. “Although protests are an integral part of civil democracy all over the world, NSCIA believes that the timing is wrong,” the council said. A US-backed airstrike had killed Soleimani, who is the Revolutionary Guard General and head of the elite Quds Force, at Baghdad International Airport. Soleimani’s killing had sparked rumors of a third world war likely to start between the US and Iran. DAILY POST also reported that Trump had disclosed that Soleimani was plotting to kill lots of American citizens but was caught in the process. Also, Iran had threatened to attack the US White House, following warning of retaliation by Trump. The threat was issued by Iranian MP, Abolfazl Abutorabi during an open session of parliament in Tehran, Iran, the country’s Labour News Agency reports

Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has called for his Tottenham Hotspur counterpart, Jose Mourinho, to be respected. Both tacticians go head-to-head in the Premier League on Sunday. The Spurs job is Mourinho’s first, since he was sacked by Manchester United in December 2018. But despite Mourinho’s mixed spell at Old Trafford, Guardiola insists his old foe should still be considered one of the best managers in the world. “The value of Jose, a manager with a lot of experience, with a lot of success, is not to be judged on one season, or one-and-a-half seasons. “The guys who judge his career not on 15 or 20 years, it’s because people don’t understand anything. As a professional I try to judge my colleagues not for one season but 10 or 15 years, a long career. That for me gives more value. “Periods for managers are up and down, everyone has it. For 15 or 20 years, Jose has been there all the time and that must be respected, from my point of view. “Because I think it’s the most difficult thing — to stay for a long time and to be there all the time,” Guardiola told a press conference on Friday.

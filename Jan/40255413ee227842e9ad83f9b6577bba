Manchester United’s new signing, Bruno Fernandes, will wear the no. 18 for the club, the UK Metro reports. United completed the signing of Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon on Thursday for an initial fee of £46.5million (€55m), with up to £21.1m (€25m) to follow in add-ons. The 25-year-old has signed a five-and-a-half-year contract at Old Trafford. Fernandes wore No.8 for Sporting, but that number is currently occupied by Juan Mata at Old Trafford. United opted to not reveal the shirt number during his unveiling. However, all was revealed by Fernandes’ agent, Miguel Pinho, who posted a picture of himself alongside Fernandes holding United’s No.18 shirt on Instagram.

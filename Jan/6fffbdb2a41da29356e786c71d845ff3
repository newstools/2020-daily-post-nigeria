Chelsea are ready to rival Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur for the signature of Dinamo Zagreb midfielder, Dani Olmo, according to the L’Esportiu. The Catalan newspaper reports that the Blues are monitoring the 21-year-old’s situation and have submitted a proposal to Dinamo in a bid to sign the Spain youngster this January’s transfer window. Apart from Chelsea, the Croatian club have also received proposals from Barcelona and Tottenham for Olmo. Olmo has been impressive for Dinamo since joining the club in 2014. He has scored eight goals and provided seven assists in twenty-two appearances for the club. Olmo recently admitted that he would like to move to Europe this month to continue his career. “I am at the best of in short career and I feel great,” Olmo said. “Maybe the ideal time to leave the Dinamo would have been last summer, but no offers came. “But if there is an understanding between the clubs, I think the best thing for everyone is to leave Zagreb now [ in January].” “I want to take a step forward. And not only to go to the Euro, but also to keep improving.”

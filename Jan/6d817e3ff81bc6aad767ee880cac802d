Apostle Johnson Suleman of Omega Fire Ministries, on Friday, said those Nigerians celebrating that the Founder and General Overseer of the Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo was denied visa to the United States are unhappy people. Reports had emerged on Friday that the embassy denied Oyedepo visa because the Bishop did not qualify for a visa renewal after its assessment. It was also reported that the Bishop while querying the grounds for his refusal, created a scene at the Embassy. But the United States embassy described the reports as ‘false’. It said ”#FalseNewsAlert!’’ Be advised, the reports making the rounds about a visa being denied to Nigerian Bishop Oyedepo are false.” However, writing on his Twitter page, Apostle Suleman said, “Many Nigerians are bitter, they don’t even love themselves, so don’t expect love from them. “Also, life has not been fair to some, so they are enraged and looking for whom to vent on, commendations/condemnation are like bitter kola,chew but don’t swallow it.”

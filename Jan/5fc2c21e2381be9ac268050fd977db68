One Emmanuel Nwabueze has been arraigned before Ejigbo magistrate court for allegedly falsely obtaining drinks valued at N123,000 for friends at Kendallas Hotel Powerline, Isheri Idimu. Nwabueze was said to have brought his friends from Abule Egba to the Hotel on January 2, 2020 and ordered the drinks for them from one of the hotel waitress, Tolulope Adeokun. According to the prosecutor, Kenneth Asibor, the suspect told the hotel manager he was not with cash and that he would like to pay through bank transfer. Asibor said: “After collecting the bank account, Nwabueze told the manager he had transfered the money knowing that he was telling a lie. “The bank manager, who waited for some minutes without getting the credit alert or confirmation of any money transfer held him down and later followed him to his bank where it was confirmed he had no money in his account. “He was then handed over to the police at Idimu, where he confessed to the offense and was charged to court.” Having found him guilty of the offence, the magistrate in charge, Mr. Teslim Shomade, placed Nwabueze on bail condition of N200,000 with two years tax verification. The suspect was remanded in the police custody till he would be able to perfect his bail as the case was adjourned till February 19, 2020.

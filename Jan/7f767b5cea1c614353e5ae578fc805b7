Lagos State Government has explained that the statues of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, and Obafemi Awolowo, were intact. Commissioner for Transportation, Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, told newsmen on Thursday that the statues were removed for the purpose of development. He said: “The Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration in a bid to finding a lasting solution to traffic gridlocks in the State, identified about 60 congestion points and has started work to improve traffic experienced in five major locations.” Oladeinde said the government duly informed and consulted the Anikulapo-Kuti’s family before the action was taken, noting that the whole process is for the benefit of Lagos residents. The Commissioner said that Fela statue will be relocated to the roundabout between Allen Avenue and Opebi-Toyin Street. “We are in the process of erecting the beautiful work of art, depicting Fela Anikulapo-Kuti at the Opebi-Toyin Street junction. “The Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture is also working on a befitting location to erect the old Obafemi Awolowo statue.” Meanwhile, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has effected a minor cabinet reshuffle, with the appointment of three new members. The cabinet members were sworn in last August.

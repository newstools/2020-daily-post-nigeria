Manchester United are preparing to offer Jesse Lingard plus £45million in cash, to try and land James Maddison from Leicester City, the UK Mirror reports. United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is desperate to Maddison as he seeks to begin the next stage of their rebuilding project. Lingard, 27, has failed to kick on at Old Trafford and his poor form has seen England boss, Gareth Southgate, sideline him. The midfielder, valued at £40 million by United, hasn’t been involved in any of the Three Lions’ last six matches, since playing against Switzerland in the UEFA Nations League Finals in Portugal last summer. Maddison, though, has been in red-hot form for Leicester. And it is understood that United are prepared to almost three times his current £55,000-a-week wage, to seal the deal.

Former Premier League star, Gary Lineker has questioned the VAR decision to rule out Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino’s goal against Manchester United on Sunday. He said he is “Not sure that was a clear and obvious error, if an error at all.” Firmino thought he had put the Reds two goals ahead against Manchester United when he curved his shot past United’s goalkeeper David de Gea. But as soon as the ball entered the net, referee Craig Pawson was surrounded by furious Manchester United players demanding a VAR check take place. The Red Devils players claimed that De Gea had been fouled in the build-up to the goal and that as a result it should not stand. A VAR check showed Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk competing for a header in the Liverpool box before Firmino hit the back of the net. Van Dijk collided with De Gea in the air and sent him sprawling to the ground. VAR deemed that De Gea had been fouled by Van Dijk, and subsequently, the goal that followed was ruled out. But Lineker disagreed with the VAR decision, and took to social media to tweet: “Not sure that was a clear and obvious error, if an error at all.” Liverpool went ahead to beat Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s United team 2-0 in the encounter to sustained their unbeaten run.

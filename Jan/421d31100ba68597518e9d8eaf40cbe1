Residents trooped out to almost all streets in Sokoto metropolis celebrating the affirmation of Aminu Tambuwal, as the duly elected governor of Sokoto state by the Supreme Court on Monday. DAILY POST had reported that the Supreme Court struck out the appeal brought by Ahmed Aliyu of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, challenging the Tambuwal’s election. Justice Abba Aji while delivering judgment on Monday, affirmed that the appeal lacks merit as the appellant could not prove the grounds of his appeal which, inter alia, involved over-voting and non-compliance with the electoral law. However, The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) observed that the crowd, mostly youth trooped to the streets chanting songs in favour of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Tambuwal. Some of the crowded streets include Fodio road, Runjin Sambo, Usmanu Danfodiyo University road, Old market, Gobirawa, Rijiya among others. One of the youths Aliyu Usman who spoke with NAN, thanked Almighty Allah for the governor’s success at the Apex Court.

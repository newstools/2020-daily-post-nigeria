Manchester United board members want Mauricio Pochettino appointed as manager at the end of the season, according to the UK Independent. Pochettino was a strong favourite for the Old Trafford job after Jose Mourinho was sacked. Instead, Solskjaer was hired in December 2018. The Norwegian hit the ground running during his temporary spell in charge at United and was subsequently given a permanent deal. However, his record since then has been poor and United are currently five points outside of the Champions League places. Solskjaer is not in immediate danger of being sacked, but certain members of the United board are still keen on replacing Solskjaer with Pochettino at the end of the season. Pochettino is out of job since leaving Tottenham Hotspur in December 2019.

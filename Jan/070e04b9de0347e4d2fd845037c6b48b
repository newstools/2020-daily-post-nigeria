Manchester United legend Rio Ferdinand has insisted that current Premier League leaders, Liverpool still have some way to go before they can be compared to Red Devils Champions League winning side. According to the former England defender, the Reds cannot be compared with Manchester United’s side of 2008 unless they win back to back Premier League titles. Liverpool won the Champions League last season, a feat Ferdinand achieved with United in 2008. But in the same period, Manchester United reeled off a host of title triumphs – three in a row between 2006 and 2009. Jurgen Klopp’s side now look set to lift the Premier League trophy for the first in 30 years having gone 13 points clear of the EPL table. Ferdinand believes the Reds must win then defend the Premier League before they can be compared to his crop of United greats During a question and answer session on Twitter, Ferdinand was asked how he would compare this Liverpool team with the United Champions League winning team in 2008. He replied, “Need to win back to back league titles before being compared but there’s no denying they’re on route to being great team!”

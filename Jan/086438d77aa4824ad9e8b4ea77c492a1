Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane has singled out Isco, Toni Kroos and Luka Modric for praise following his side’s Spanish Super Cup 3-1 victory over Valencia on Wednesday night. Three goals from Toni Kroos, Isco and Luka Modric ensured Zidane’s men defeated Valencia at the King Abdullah Stadium in Jeddah, Saudi. Speaking after the game, Zidane was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying: “I’m happy with how everyone played, it’s difficult to pick one above the rest. “I’m thrilled for Isco getting his goal, he needed that recently; Kroos’ inventiveness was fantastic, and Modric’s effort, that’s his specialty. “It’s what a manager wants to see, for his players to be in great shape. We should be happy, but we haven’t won anything yet. “We have to rest now, and tomorrow we’ll start preparing for the final.” Real Madrid will now play the winner between Barcelona and Atletico Madrid in the final.

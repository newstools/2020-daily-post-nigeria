Wolves boss, Nuno Espirito Santo has responded to report linking striker, Raul Jimenez with a move to Manchester United. DAILY POST had reported that Jimenez is believed to be on the list of strikers being targeted by Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this January’s transfer window.  Speaking on the development after his side’s goalless draw with Man United in the FA Cup third-round encounter on Sunday night at the Molineux Stadium, Santo admitted that ‘anything can happen,’ adding that his side are delighted to have Jimenez. “This is the first time I heard it,” Santo was quoted by Metro UK as saying at post-match. “Ole didn’t mention anything about that. The transfer window is open. When it is open anything can happen. “We are delighted to have Raul.” Jimenez has been impressive for Wolves since he joined the Premier League side from Benfica in 2018. The 28-year-old has scored 17 goals in all competitions for Santo’s men so far this season.

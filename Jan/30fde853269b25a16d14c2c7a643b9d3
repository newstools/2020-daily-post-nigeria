Pat Utomi, Professor of Political Economics and former presidential candidate, has insisted that Nigeria won’t be in existence if the Biafra Civil war was fought in the present day. Utomi explained that Nigeria may not exist if Biafra was fought today due to the recognition given by the international community to self-determination. He made the assertion while delivering his keynote address at the 50th anniversary of Nigeria’s Civil War organised by the Nzuko Umunna and Ndigbo in Lagos, on Monday. The Professor also called for the de-centralisation of Nigeria’s government, stressing that such will move the government closer to the people. According to Utomi: “Government should be de-centralised and moved closer to the people for effectiveness. “We must address the issues that led to the Civil War. “I can tell you that if the Biafran war is fought today, there will be no Nigeria because the international community now recognises self-determination.”

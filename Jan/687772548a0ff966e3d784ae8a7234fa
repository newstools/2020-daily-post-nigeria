Former Bayern Munich midfielder, Owen Hargreaves, has said that the current group of Manchester United players are not good enough to finish higher than fifth in the Premier League. Hargreaves, a former Man United midfielder hit out at the club’s recruitment and how certain players were never replaced after leaving over the past year. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side lost three of their last four matches, including a 2-0 defeat at home to Burnley. United were expected to make one or two additions in the January transfer window to help them fight for a Champions League spot this season, but time is running out and one player has been brought in. Hargreaves said, “He [Solskjaer] desperately needs help,” he told BT Sport. “If you think, [Ander] Herrere left, [Marouane] Fellaini left, in midfield, they are really light. “Then [Romelu] Lukaku leaves, [Alexis] Sanchez leaves, they don’t have any help up top. “[Marcus] Rashford then gets injured, [Paul] Pogba hasn’t played. [Scott] McTominay, one of their best players this season, hasn’t played. “The recruitment wasn’t there to back Ole up and then injuries to key players. “To be fifth with this squad, I think right now is as good as it can possibly get. “There are only four points separating fifth and 14th. I don’t think it’s going to more up, it’s more likely to go down and that’s the big worry.”

According to him, Young was signed to provide cover for the injured
Kwadwo Asamoah. Conte spoke on Saturday during his press conference ahead of the visit of Cagliari. The former Juventus boss said, “Transfer window? ” We added Young o make up for Asamoah’s serious injury, on the right you talk about Moses, but he arrived because at the same time Lazaro left. “There are additions, but there are also departures and injuries. “And we aren’t buying half of the starters on Real Madrid, but rather players that arrive on loan and are 34 years old.”

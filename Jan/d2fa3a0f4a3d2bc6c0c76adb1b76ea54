Members of Islamic Movement in Nigeria (IMN) otherwise known as ‘Shi’ites’ have raised the alarm that Nigerian government is not willing to release their leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky ‘but wants him to die in detention’. A disciple of the religious preacher and national president of the association of Shi’ite singers called ‘ Ittihadus Shu’ara Harakatil Islamiyya’, Malam Mustafa Umar Gadonkaya made the allegation over the weekend during the lunching of 100 songs in solidarity of the detained sheikh composed by the association. According to him, their leader was arrested and held by security agents since December 2015, noting that the authorities have allegedly refused to obey the court that ordered his release, payment of compensation and reconstruction of his demolished buildings during the encounter between the sect members and the Nigerian Army four years ago in Zaria, Kaduna State. “It is known by everyone that our leader sued the government over human rights violation and a federal high court in Abuja ordered his release, reconstruction of his demolished residence and payment of compensation. But the government has disregard for courts and refused to obey the court order. What kind of injustice is this? “At the moment, everyone knows that he is very ill as a result of the gunshots he sustained but these people still keep him in detention despite his ill-health. So if anything happens to him, government will be held responsible. “Aside their disobedience to the court, the federal government, however, accepted the request of Kaduna state government to hand him over to it for prosecution over some baseless accusations. Their motive is to continue to hold him until he dies in detention,” he alleged. The singers, therefore, demanded that the authorities should without further delay-free El-Zakzaky, his wife and other members vowing that unless they are released unconditionally, they will continue to protest.

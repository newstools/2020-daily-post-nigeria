The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Wednesday, arraigned one Alhaji Salisu Suleiman and his company Faris Construction Company limited before Justice C.N. Orji of the Federal Capital Territory High Court, Abuja for an alleged criminal breach of trust and issuance of dud cheque. He is facing a seven-count charge. One of the charges reads: “That you, Alhaji Salisu Suleiman being the Managing Director of Faris Construction Co. Ltd And Faris Construction Co. Ltd sometimes in August, 2016 in Abuja within the Abuja Judicial Division of the Federal Capital Territory did issue a Zenith Bank cheque dated 8th August, 2016 in favour of Alpha Praxis Nigeria Ltd in the sum of N10,000,000 in settlement of part of the N62,658,999 owed Alpha Praxis Nigeria Ltd for the supply of Bitumen 60/70 which said cheque when presented for payment within three months of issuance was returned unpaid due to insufficient funds standing to your account and you thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 1(1)(a) of the Dishonored Cheque (Offences) act Cap 102 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria and punishable under Section 1 (1) (b) (i) (ii) of the same Act 2007.” The defendant pleaded “not guilty” to the charge. Based on their plea, prosecuting counsel, Yetunde Alabi, requested for a trial date, and asked the court to remand them in prison. Counsel for the defence, W.Y Mamman, told the court to graciously admit the defendant the administrative bail he enjoyed earlier by the EFCC, and the one granted to him by Justice Musale who handled the case before. However, the PC told the court the surety that stood for the defendant had withdrawn after Justice Musale was transferred, and it has been difficult to reach. Justice Orji , thereafter, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N2 million each, and one “reasonable” surety and resident in Abuja. The case has been adjourned to March 17, 2020 for hearing.

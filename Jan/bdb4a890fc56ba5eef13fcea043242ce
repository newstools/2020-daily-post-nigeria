Premier League legend, Rio Ferdinand has said that the grit and determination showed by the Arsenal players in their 2-2 with Chelsea last night stemmed from their manager, Mikel Arteta. Arsenal defender David Luiz was given a red card after hauling down Tammy Abraham inside the box, allowing Jorginho to score from the penalty spot. Gavriel Martinelli then pulled Arsenal back level, running the ball from his own half before slotting coolly past Chelsea’s Kepa Arrizabalaga. Cesar Azpilicueta’s 83rd minute strike appeared to have won it for the Blues, but Bellerin ensured a share of the spoils with his equaliser three minutes from time. Ferdinand believes the result could prove a catalyst for Arsenal’s season. “I think Arteta shouted and called for a shift in mentality,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “We’ve spoke about it before, they’ve been renowned for having a group of people with fragile mentalities. “This could be a turning point, the way they’ve come back in terms of going a goal down, down to 10 men, being in disarray for a while, gaining composure, and chewing out a result like this. “The way they do it, that demands character, that demands spirit, that demands a mentality, and then added to that quality in vital moments. They’ve showed that in abundance today.”

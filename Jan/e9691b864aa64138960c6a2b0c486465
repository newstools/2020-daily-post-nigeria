The All Progressives Congress, APC, has reacted to the Supreme Court ruling affirming the election of Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State. APC described the Supreme Court ruling as totally strange to its expectations and facts at its disposal. DAILY POST had reported that the Supreme Court had struck out the appeal brought by Ahmed Aliyu of APC challenging the last governorship election in the state. Tambuwal was duly elected in the governorship election conducted on March 9, 2019 in Sokoto State. But, Justice Abba Aji while delivering judgment on Monday, affirmed that the appeal lacks merit as the appellant could not prove the grounds of his appeal which, inter alia, involved over-voting and non-compliance with the electoral law. However, in a statement by its spokesperson, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC assured that it won’t threaten the peace of Nigeria’s democracy, despite the ruling. The statement reads partly: “We have just lost Sokoto State governorship to PDP on account of the judgment delivered today by the Supreme Court. “We should state that the judgment is completely strange to our expectations based on the facts before us. For the record, Alhaji Aminu Tambuwa, the current Governor of Sokoto State, is on his seat with 324 votes with over 30,000 canceled votes in the March governorship election. “PDP does not see anything wrong in this, but it is comfortable with Mr. Emeka Ihedioha occupying the governorship seat in Imo State for seven months without meeting the constitutional requirement of 25 percent in two-third of the Local Government Councils in the state. “Unlike PDP, we are not going to behave like spoilt brats and threatened the peace of the country over the surprising judgment of the Supreme Court on the Sokoto State seat.”

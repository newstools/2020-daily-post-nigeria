Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has described the missile attack on US bases on Wednesday as a slap on America’s face. Khamenel said the US should withdraw from the region, adding that Iran’s missile attacks on US was just the beginning of more attacks to follow. “Military action like this is not sufficient. What is important is ending the corrupting presence of America in the region,” Khamenei said in a televised speech, according to Al Jazeera. He ruled out any resumption of talks with Washington about a 2015 nuclear deal. Khamenei also said the US was trying to remove Lebanon’s Hezbollah movement in its bid to help Israel. Multiple missiles were launched at Iraq from Iran targeting American military facilities. The facilities include Erbil in northern Iraq and Al Asad Air Base in western Iraq. US had since reacted to the attack after Iran announced that it carried out “a successful operation called Operation Martyr Soleimani, with the code Oh Zahra”.

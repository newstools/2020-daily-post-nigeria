Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has insisted that he will stay at the club for at least one more full season, except he is sacked. Guardiola has won two Premier League titles, two Carabao Cups and one FA Cup since he arrived in 2016. City also became the first side to win a domestic treble under the Spaniard. The champions are however unlikely to win a third successive league title, having fallen 14 points behind the Reds this season. It has been suggested that Guardiola could leave the Etihad, if he fails to mastermind European success. But he fully intends to see out his contract through to the end of next season no matter what happens. “I say many times, unless the club sack me, I’m going to stay 100 per cent,” Guardiola told reporters ahead of the clash against Crystal Palace. “For sure, 100% I’m going to stay here next season. “Not because we won the last two games or playing better the last few months. “I enjoy working with them and I like it, but even if it’s going bad and we are not in the Champions League, I will not leave. “As a manager, there are good and bad moments, you don’t win all the time. But it’s all about what we can do next and how we can improve.”

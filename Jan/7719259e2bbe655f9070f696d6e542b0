Manchester United, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has called for the club’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, and the board to look to strengthen the Red Devils squad by signing players this month rather than losing them. Solskjaer said this following Man United’s 3-1 defeat against Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg encounter on Tuesday night at Old Trafford. The Norwegian was left light in attack, after the late departures of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez. Solskjaer’s side are yet to sign new player in this January’s transfer window and their captain, Ashley Young has been linked with a move to Inter Milan this month. “We have got a few months left of the season and we can’t weaken ourselves,” Solskjaer said as quoted by Mirror UK at his post-match press conference. “We have got to strengthen ourselves if any movement is going to happen. “I don’t know. You have got to ask Ash, For me, it is about focusing on the next game.”

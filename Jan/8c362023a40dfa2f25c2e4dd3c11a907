Liverpool midfielder, Fabinho has welcomed Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe to Anfield. Fabinho played alongside Mbappe during their time at AS Monaco in the French Ligue 1. The Brazilian wants the France international to make a transfer move to join the Reds. He believes that Mbappe will have a Ballon d’Or before PSG star, Neymar. “Mbappe will have a Ballon d’Or before Neymar,” Fabinho told French TV show Telefoot. “I would like to welcome him to Liverpool.” Meanwhile, Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has recently admitted that Mbappe is too expensive for the club. Klopp said: “Buying this calibre of player is difficult. I don’t see any club at the moment who can buy Kylian Mbappe from PSG. “I don’t see any club, that is how it is. And we are involved in the clubs that cannot do it. It is as easy as that. “Okay, from a sporting point of view, there are not a lot of reasons to not sign him. What a player he is. “But it is about the money of course. No chance. Absolutely no chance. Sorry for killing that story.”

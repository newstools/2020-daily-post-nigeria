Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp has spoken on forward, Takumi Minamino’s performance following his side’s Premier League 2-1 win over Wolves on Thursday night. Klopp says Minamino, who replaced Sadio Mane in the first half of the encounter, did ‘exceptionally well’ against the host, adding that he completely integrated himself in the game. Goals from Jordan Henderson and Roberto Firmino gave the Reds all three points against the hosts at Molineux as Raul Jimenez’s strike was not enough to salvage a point for Wolves. The win over Wolves means Liverpool are now 16 points ahead of second place, Manchester City on the Premier League table. Speaking on Minamino’s display against Wolves, Klopp was quoted by Liverpool’s official website as saying after the match: “Super. We had the situation that Sadio goes off, we played tonight slightly different to usual. We had to defend in a 4-4-2 then played offensive in our normal system. “If now Div is coming on, who would deserve it, 100 per cent, because he is in incredible shape, it’s really very offensive very early in the game. Taki had now two or three weeks training with us, played different positions in training at least, played centrally in the FA Cup game, now played right and left-wing. “He can play that, we need him, but he is not a winger in this understanding, he’s a player between the lines so Oxlade had then to be a bit higher so that we had still offers in behind, so we can still stretch the formation. “So it was really difficult for Taki, he felt immediately the calf, at half-time he needed treatment – we hope it’s nothing and he could go through so it should be fine. That was the first Premier League game exceptionally well and he is completely integrated in the team and that’s really good.”

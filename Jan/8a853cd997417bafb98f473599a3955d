The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has ranked Rivers State as the second state in the federation where money is mostly laundered. Acting Chairman of the EFCC, Ibrahim Magu said this while briefing newsmen in Port Harcourt on the gains of the anti-graft agency. Magu said that the rampant cases of money laundering were because of the status of Port Harcourt as an oil city. On the issue of oil theft and illegal crude oil business, the EFCC boss, Ibrahim Magu said that the two hundred and forty four trucks impounded by the army had been put up for auction. “This place (Rivers) used to be headquarters of money laundering. This is because there is a lot of money, oil money, bunkered money and so on. “You can’t but rate Port Harcourt behind Lagos because here you see people sinking, diving, diving money and even colluding and conspiring with those that hide money but we are watching,” Magu said.

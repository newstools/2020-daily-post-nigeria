Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, said on Thursday that the South-West security initiative, Operation Amotekun was shaping up well. The Governor made the declaration while attending the 80th Annual General Conference of Cherubim and Seraphim Unification Church of Nigeria, held at Ashi, Orita Bashorun, Ibadan. He equally reiterated the determination of his administration to ensure a peaceful, safe and secure Oyo State. Makinde said: “I was with the Inspector General of Police yesterday and we had close to 30 minutes deliberation back and forth on how to make our State and country secure. “We also discussed on how Amotekun is not supposed to replace the function of the Nigerian Police and the community police they are setting up. “They are to complement those efforts to make our society safer. Very soon, we will begin to reap the reward of Operation Amotekun. “All the issues before us are being addressed right now; Amotekun is definitely here to stay.I will continue to work for the benefit of all to provide a peaceful, safe and secure State where we can all worship without fear. “All of us cannot worship God in an atmosphere of fear. I am happy that Amotekun, the regional security outfit to which Oyo State subscribes to, is shaping up brilliantly. “Today is not for proverbs, it is a day for speaking clearly and openly about the role that religion and worship play in our lives. As I am standing before you today, Oyo State needs prayers. “Some elements have threatened to disrupt the peace of local government councils so that a state of emergency can be declared in the State but with our prayers, their plans will not come into fruition.”

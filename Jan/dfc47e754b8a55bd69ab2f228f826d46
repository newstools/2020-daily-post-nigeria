Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has admitted that his team struggled to deal with the movement and positioning of Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil. Lampard, speaking to BT Sport, also expressed his disappointment on how his side dealt with playing against 10 men. The Gunners were a man down before the half-hour mark, after David Luiz was sent off. Jorginho made it 1-0 from the penalty spot before Gabriel Martinelli ran through to equalize. Arsenal captain, Hector Bellerin, equalised three minutes after opposing captain Cesar Azpilicueta thought he had claimed a victory for the Blues. Asked why his side struggled to control the game despite their one-man advantage, Lampard explained: “Well I think probably for 15 minutes in the first half it did because I think we were still probably in the mindset of them with 11. “And Ozil pulling out to the side and giving you some problems and I think we ended up being in a kind of middle ground.”

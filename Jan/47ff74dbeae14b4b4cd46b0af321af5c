The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, has directed the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) to immediately implement measures aimed at re-positioning the broadcast industry with a view to sanitizing the industry, creating jobs, promoting local content, boosting the advert industry and bringing the broadcast industry up to par with the best practices from around the world. Lai Mohammed in a statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST by the Special Assistant to the President on Media, Mr Segun Adeyemi, said the directive becomes necessary following the submission of the report of a committee set up to work out the modalities for implementing the recommendations approved by President Muhammadu Buhari to re-position the broadcast industry. ”Following my satisfaction with the report which was very professional and detailed, I wish to direct the Commission to take the necessary measures to effect the implementation of the various provisions therein. “This directive covers the provision for the regulation of the web and online TV/radio; regulation of international broadcasters beaming signals into Nigeria; hate speech; human resource and staff welfare; funding for the reforms implementation; monitoring; Independence of the Regulator and ease of issuing Licenses as well as competition and monopoly issues,” he said. Lai Mohammed also expressed confidence that the new regulations, which are due to come into effect this January, will re-energize the broadcast industry, deliver real value in the sector and grow the creative industry for the benefit of practitioners. ”This regulation prevents the misuse of monopoly or market power or anti-competitive and unfair practices by a foreign or local broadcaster to suppress other local broadcasters in the television and radio markets, having removed exclusivity from all content in Nigeria and mandated the sharing of all content upon the payment of commercially viable fees,” the Minister said.

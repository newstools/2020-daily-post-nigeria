Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has announced a change in the date of completion of the Lagos-Ibadan rail. Amaechi while inspecting the rail project on Monday said the completion of the Lagos-Ibadan rail line by April 2020 is no longer feasible as a result of the extension of the rail line to the seaport. The Minister who was accompanied on inspection of the ongoing work by Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, stated that they will continue to work and redouble their efforts to complete the project and meet set targets. On his official Twitter page, Amaechi wrote: “Today, Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde is accompanying us on the monthly inspection of work on the Lagos-Ibadan rail line. “We are going the whole nine yards from the mega station in Ebute Metta to Apapa and all the way to Ibadan. A large chunk of this rail line is in Oyo State. “Looking at the state of work in Apapa, completing the project in April doesn’t seem feasible, especially the extension of the rail line to the seaport. “We’ll however, continue to work and redouble our efforts to complete the project and meet set targets. “However the Itakpe-Warri rail line project is now complete and ready for commissioning. President Muhammadu Buhari will do the honours.”

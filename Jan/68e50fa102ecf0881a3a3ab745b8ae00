Former Manchester United captain Roy Keane, has said that Premier League leaders, Liverpool can go from “strength to strength” in the coming years and in doing so dominate English football. Liverpool are on course to end their 30-year wait to lift the EPL title with Jurgen Klopp’s side currently holding a 13-point lead over second-place Manchester City in the Premier League table. Going into their game against Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Manchester United on Sunday evening, Liverpool are also on a 38-game unbeaten run. Keane noted that given Klopp and a number of Liverpool’s stars have committed their long-term future to the club, they could easily dominate the EPL for years to come. “No, of course not (view hasn’t changed on them winning the league), they have been outstanding,” Keane told Sky Sports Super Sunday. “I think we were all hoping that City might put them under a little bit more pressure but they have been so consistent over the last year and a half, two years. “It’s just a matter of time before they get their hands on that trophy. “The main concern for lots of the other clubs is, can they kick on over the next few years? “Klopp has signed a new contract, they have a lot of brilliant young players, they will probably go from strength to strength.”

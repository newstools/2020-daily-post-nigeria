The Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere has told the South West governors not to be intimidated by the declaration of the federal government through the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister for Justice, Abubakar Malami that Operation Amotekun is an illegal security outfit. The leader of the group, Pa Reuben Fasoranti gave the backing of the group to the governors on Thursday at his Akure residence in Ondo State. The Afenifere leader said “Operation Amotekun is a welcome development, but they were being asked not to do it. The Governor of Ondo State, Rotimi Akeredolu, insisted that they would do it. “I want them to go ahead and do it in the interest of our people; we cannot leave ourselves here, and be helpless in the face of incessant onslaught.” Pa Fasoranti added that “I think he is talking for somebody. Silence means consent, he is talking the mind of the presidency, that is what they want. It confirms the suspicion that they are trying to protect some interests here in the South-West. I agree with that too, so that they can go on and do what they like with impunity. It is unfortunate. “It is very bad to leave our people helpless, defenceless and without any succour; without any protection. “Though Afenifere has not met on this, but I am speaking their mind; their mind is that they (the governors) should go ahead. The governors should speak with one voice and go ahead. I am speaking for the Yoruba elders too, they should go ahead.”

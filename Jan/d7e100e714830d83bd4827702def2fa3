Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has refused to confirm if he was eyeing a move for Wolves striker, Raul Jimenez. Jimenez came on in the second half, as both sides played a 0-0 draw in the FA Cup third round on Saturday. It was a game in which the Red Devils failed to record a single shot on target. Solskjaer is believed to be in the market for a striker and has already seen targets Mario Mandzukic and Erling Haaland join other clubs. When asked about Jimenez after the game at the Molineux, the Norwegian said: “Another good player being linked with us. “He came on and did really well. Loads of players are being linked with us. I can’t comment on speculation.” Jimenez, 28, joined Wolves from Benfica in 2018 and has scored 34 goals in 77 games.

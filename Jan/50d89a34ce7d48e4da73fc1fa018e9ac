Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has reacted after midfielder, Danny Drinkwater returned to the club following the end of his loan spell at Burnley. DAILY POST had reported that Burnley manager, Sean Dyche confirmed last Friday that Drinkwater is returning to Chelsea at the end of his loan spell at Turf Moor this week. “Drinkwater is very understanding,” Dyche told Burnley’s official website. “He’s a good lad and I like him a lot and I think he’s a very good player. We couldn’t get him the game-time that he wanted and therefore he’s going to take his chance in January and see if something else comes up that can promise him more game-time. “There’s no grudge to bear. We enjoyed his company and him being around but just couldn’t get enough football for him. It’s a professional decision from his point of view. “There was a moment when we had injuries and he probably would have played but things happen in football. “He has been a credit to himself with his professionalism, other than the incident; the way he has recovered from that and the way has looked after himself. “He has tried to be part of the group. We just haven’t got him as much game-time as he wanted and he needs. I like him as a player and a character and I wish him well.” Reacting to the development, Lampard refused to rule out the possibility of Drinkwater going out on loan again. When asked after Chelsea’s FA Cup 2-0 win against Nottingham Forest whether Drinkwater would be loaned out again, Lampard said as quoted by Football London: “We will see. It is a possibility.” Aston Villa are reportedly interested to sign Drinkwater, after losing John McGinn to an ankle injury some days ago.

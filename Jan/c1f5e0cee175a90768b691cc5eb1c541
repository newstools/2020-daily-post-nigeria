The All Progressives Congress (APC) has lauded its members in Adamawa for remaining calm and law abiding in spite of Supreme Court ruling that confirmed election of Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). DAILY POST had reported that the Supreme Court on Monday, dismissed the appeal challenging the election of Ahmadu Fintri as duly elected Governor of Adamawa State. The apex court held that the All Progressives Congress, APC, and its candidate, Jibrilla Bindow, failed to prove their allegation that Fintri emerged through over-voting. Reacting, a statement signed on Wednesday by the State Publicity Secretary of the party, Alhaji Mohammed Abdullahi said the party accepted the ruling in good faith but with some reservations. “The party leadership wishes to commiserate with Jibirilla our teaming stakeholders, elected representatives, party loyalists and supporters over the Supreme Court verdict. “Litigation is part of the electoral process that is aimed at deepening our democracy which is guaranteed by the Constitution and the electoral act. “The party which always encourages its members to remain law abiding exploited the legal option and pursued same to its logical conclusion. The process has now come to an end with the verdict of the apex Court which we have accepted in good faith with some reservations. “We therefore wish to thank all members of our great party for sustaining the legal struggle up to the Supreme Court. It was indeed the support and encouragement of the party members that made it possible.
“It is now time for us to take stock of our journey as a political party. “We should restrategise and embrace very serious and deep reconciliation among our stakeholders and members to enable us come out stronger and more united before the next round of elections,” he said. Abdullahi urged elected representatives and critical stakeholders of the party to pay attention to the party in order to sustain the large number of follower-ship in the state.

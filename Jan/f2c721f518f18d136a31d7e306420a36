Real Madrid beat Sevilla 2-1 on Saturday, to climb above rivals Barcelona into first place. Casemiro scored twice on either side of Luuk de Jong’s fine strike, to make the difference at the Santiago Bernabeu. Zinedine Zidane’s men have now gone 17 matches unbeaten. Sevilla stay fourth, eight points off the top. Barca can reclaim first place on Sunday, when they face Granada at Camp Nou. It will be Quique Setien’s first game in charge, after replacing Ernesto Valverde.

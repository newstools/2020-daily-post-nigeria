Lille manager, Christophe Galtier, has said he is not bothered by speculation linking Victor Osimhen and two other players with a move to Real Madrid. Galtier stated this on Friday, when he faced the media, ahead of their Coupe de France round of 64 clash against Raon l’Etape. Spanish sports daily, Marca, has claimed that Los Blancos are keeping tabs on Osimhen and two of his teammates, Gabriel dos Santos and Boubakary Soumaré. “Marca’s front page? I don’t know if they talked about it in the locker room. I didn’t get any feedback on that. “On a personal level, I’m focused on the competition. The transfer window will end on the 31st. I’ll see what will happen. “I don’t mind. I don’t get a sense of pride either. The media may be the news. I didn’t talk about it with my president or with Luis Campos. That doesn’t interest me,” Galtier said.

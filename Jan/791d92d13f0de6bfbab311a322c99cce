Jigawa State command of the Nigerian security and civil defence corps, NSCDC, has threatened to sanction filling stations and cooking gas vendors that are operating below standard across the state. Spokesman of the command, SC Adamu Shehu disclosed this in a press statement issued to DAILY POST in Dutse. He said the Command observed with dismay the nonchalant attitudes displayed by some of those businesses to safety standards set aside during emergencies. The statement explained that in its recent inspection tour to some filling stations and cooking gas selling outlets in Dutse metropolis, out of twenty one (21) stations visited, only nine (9) stations conformed with the safety measures. The command said the defaulting stations were found with already exhausted and expired fire extinguishers. NSCDC commandant in the state, Alh Garba Muhammad, threatened to invoke the wrath of the law if they continued to compromise in the safety standards. Alhaji Garba emphasized that every filling station must comply with the safety requirements such as active fire extinguishers, sand buckets, No smoking signs, among others. He equally warned cooking gas vendors against selling the commodity amidst residential areas. The Commandant noted that noncompliance will be treated as an act of negligence and recklessness against innocent lives and property of the people in the state.

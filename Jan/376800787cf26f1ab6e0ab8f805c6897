Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford has revealed what he expects from Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City when his side take on the Premier League champions in tonight’s Carabao Cup semi-final first-leg clash. Rashford said he expects Guardiola to “change something” in his formation that will face Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side at Old Trafford. Man United recently defeated Man City 2-1 in the Premier League last December when both sides clashed at the Etihad Stadium. “It’s two big games against City but we’re one step away from Wembley,” Rashord told MUTV. “That’s the objective for us. It’s an opportunity to win a trophy and we know what that means for the club, and for the players and staff as well. Hopefully, we can perform well and get results in these two games against them and progress on to win the tournament. “It [the away win in December] gives us confidence but, to be honest, I don’t expect the game to be the same type of game as it was there. We could have been three or four goals up, so I expect them to change something. Maybe not personnel but formation. So we’ll see what they put in front of us and we have to find a way to beat them.” “I think all the players are ready for these types of games. You prepare for them mentally and, sometimes, you just drag yourself through it physically. But, as long as we’re mentally ready for the game and approach it in the right manner, with the right mindset, we know we can do it.” The kick-off time for the match is 9pm.

Following the clash between Naval Officers and sea pirates which led to the death of four Naval Ratings in Gbagira, Awoye riverine community area of Ilaje Local Government in Ondo State, a curfew has been imposed on the community. The Commanding Officer, Forward Operating Base in Igbokoda, Commodore Danjuma Ndanusa was said to have imposed the curfew in order for his men to recover the military rifles and other ammunition stolen during the clash. It was gathered that Commodore Ndanusa directed the community leaders to ensure that the four military rifles and seven magazines stolen during a gun battle at Gbagira village were produced. DAILY POST had reported how Naval officers clashed with the sea pirates while trying to rescue some foreigners kidnapped by the gunmen. Speaking on how the Ratings were killed, the Commanding Officer stated that their guns and magazines were collected by the pirates during a duel. He added that the four military rifles and seven magazines in the hands of the pirates are very dangerous to the people of the community. According to him, they got the hint from one of the pirates that was apprehended that the rifles are in the community, and that the foreigners that were rescued also aided the information. “We intimated them on what is at stake. It is like sleeping on a time bomb. I told all the Baales to get all their youths and speak with them. “That was why we did a total search and we found four telephones and one walkie-talkie belonging to the foreigners. I made this known to the four baales from the community “We also made a search on the boat they came with from Bayelsa, we were able to recover empty magazines from guns on the floor of their boat. We placed a curfew in the four communities and on the activities on the waterway by putting pressure on them to produce the arms because it is a treat to the innocents in the community,” the Commanding Officer stated.

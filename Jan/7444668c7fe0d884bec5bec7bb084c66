Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle, have announced their decision to step back from their position as senior royals. This was disclosed in a statement posted on their Instagram page on Wednesday. Harry and Meghan also said they now intend to pursue financial independence. “After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,” the statement read. “We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family and work to become financially independent while continuing to fully support Her Majesty The Queen. “It is with your encouragement, particularly over the last few years, that we feel prepared to make this adjustment. “We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honour our duty to The Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages. “This geographic balance will enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter, including the launch of our new charitable entity.” In a documentary that aired in October last year, the couple admitted that they were struggling with the spotlight.

Salihu Tanko Yakasai, a media aide of Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje has mocked Abba Yusuf over the Supreme Court ruling which affirmed the election of Governor Abdullahi Ganduje. The Supreme Court on Monday affirmed the election of Ganduje. This was after it dismissed the appeal and cross-appeal instituted by Alhaji Abba Kabiru Yusuf, the gubernatorial candidate of the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Delivering the judgment, Justice Sylvester Ngwuta declared that the grounds of the two appeals brought by the appellant were dismissed for lack of merit. He added that the grounds of the appeals were blanket in law, unproved and could not accommodate all infractions of the electoral process. Reacting, Yakasai mocked Yusuf’s supporters and Kwankwasiyya over their failure, adding that cases in Supreme court are not won by sentiments and emotions. According to him, Kwankwasiyya’s had nothing but cooked so many lies just to deceive their gullible followers in their appeal. Yakasai on his Twitter page wrote: “The Supreme Court has unanimously dismissed the case of Abba of PDP challenging the victory of H E Umar Ganduje at the 2019 elections. It is safe to officially say that Abba is coming. “It took the supreme court judges 10mins after stepping into the chambers to dismiss the Kwankwasiyya case. Like I always say, it lacked merit completely. You don’t win cases in court by woeing sentiments and emotions, you win by being able to prove your case. “The thing that sweet me the most about Ganduje’s victory is the false hope Kwankwasiyya camp gave themselves. “They had nothing but cooked so many lies just to deceive their gullible followers. That false hope is what will make today’s loss very very painful.” On Mon, Jan 20, 2020 at 11:02 AM Fikayo Olowolagba <fikayo.olowolagba@dailypost.ng> wrote:

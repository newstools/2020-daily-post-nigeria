Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has insisted he is not jealous of the Manchester City or Liverpool squads. Injuries to key players at Spurs has left Mourinho short of options. Mourinho, speaking with Sky Sports, says he accepts the situation and knows the club has a different profile. “Come on, it is what it is. We cannot have a squad like some other teams. It’s not us. “Yesterday, I was watching Man City and I looked to the bench – (Raheem) Sterling, Bernardo Silva, (Ilkay) Gundogan, (Nicolas) Otamendi. You know? “Liverpool, you see the team, you see the bench. And they have injured (Joel) Matip, (Dejan) Lovren, (Naby) Keita, Fabinho. “I’m not jealous, I have an amazing job, but they are different jobs. This is a different club,” he said.

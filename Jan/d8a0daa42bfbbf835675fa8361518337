The Kano Public Complaints and Anti- Corruption Commission said on Wednesday that it made recovery of N256, 014, 170.00 in the year 2019. According to the Executive Chairman of the Commission, Bar. Muhuyi Magaji Rimin Gado who briefed journalists at the Kano Press Centre, the Commission received a total of 3, 192 complaints. He added that 608 were resolved, 72 withdrawn, while 220 complaints were declined, within the year under review. He said 196 plots of land, 14 houses and 15 farmlands of different sizes and status were also recovered across the state. Muhuyi, who is on the verge of completing his five-year tenure as the Executive Chairman of the Kano anti-graft agency, noted that the Commission witnessed a sharp decline in recoveries due to the level of awareness and campaign against corruption launched by the agency. He said the agency has been able to establish branches across the 44 Local Government Areas in the state in its bid to get the state rid of corruption and corrupt practices. Muhuyi, who emphasized that the Commission exhibited both civil and criminal powers in its investigations, insisted that Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje did not at any time, interfer in the activities of the Commission. He also recalled how he was able to sanitize the Commission, which according to him, was under comatose when he mounted the sadle in 2015, adding that the Kano anti-graft Commission had remained a referrence point in the fight against corruption in the country and beyond. He also dedicate his achievements to the staff and officers of the Commission who he said were subjected to frequent training and re-training to boost their manpower. He commended the Kano residents for their cooperation and advised government agencies, citizens, corporate bodies and the general public to shun corruption and make Kano a corrupt-free society. Muhuyi, however, thanked Governor Ganduje for giving him free-hand to serve the state and humanity.

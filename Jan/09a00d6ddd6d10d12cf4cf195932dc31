Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has urged new manager, Quique Setien to make a bid for Manchester Cityâ€™s Sergio Aguero, the UK Mirror reports. Messi was summoned for a one-on-one meeting with Setien after he replaced Ernesto Valverde last week. It is believed that the Argentine told the new boss that Aguero is the perfect player to replace injured Luis Suarez. Suarez will be sidelined for at least four months after undergoing surgery. Aguero has scored 249 goals for City, since joining the club from Atletico Madrid in 2011. His contract at the Etihad expires in the summer of 2021.

The Plateau Government has approved the creation of seven new layouts to expand the Jos metropolis, the State Commissioner of Lands, Survey and Town Planning, Mr Yakubu Datti, has said. Dati, who disclosed this in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Jos, said the various layouts would enhance town planning at different phases. He said that the layouts would also enable the ministry to enforce town planning regulations and maintain the aesthetic value of the metropolis. He said that the layouts would have access roads for emergencies, ambulances, recreational centres, hospitals and playgrounds. “’We want to create a smart city in Jos, have layouts with good planned structure in place for development,’’ the commissioner said. He said that over the years a lot of work had been done to ensure proper planning, but that a cursory look at the state revealed that there was no proper town planning there. He lamented that most people built their houses along pathways, high tension cables and water ways, which he said was not good for effective town planning and development. Dati said the new layouts would open up the state and boost development in various sectors of its economy.

Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez has identified two things his side did wrong against Atletico Madrid when both teams clashed in Thursday’s Spanish Super Cup at the King Abdullah Sports City Stadium in Jeddah. Atletico Madrid defeated Ernesto Valverde’s side 3-2 to reach the Spanish Supercopa final, where they will face rivals, Real Madrid. Koke, Alvaro Morata and Angel Correa scored for Diego Simeone’s side, while Lionel Messi and Antoine Griezmann netted for the Catalan club. But Suarez is now saying that Barca committed ‘mistakes’ and they were ‘distracted’ at certain moments during the encounter against Atletico. “It’s not to do with us, it’s the club’s situation, but the manager isn’t to blame. Mistakes and distractions at certain moments cost us,” Suarez was quoted by Sport as saying after the match. “Whether we win, lose or draw, we always have to be self-critical. Especially when we lose. We have to work hard to make sure we don’t make the same mistakes.” Suarez will now hope to lead Barcelona to victory when they take on Granada in their next fixture in La Liga on Sunday.

Dangote Group has concluded plans to purchase 10,000 light pickup trucks. But the company appears to have shunned Nigerian carmaker, Innoson Vehicle Manufacturing, IVM, as trucks are coming in from Indonesia. Putu Juli Ardika, the Indonesian Director of Maritime Industry, Transportation Equipment and Defense Equipment, the vehicles would be purchased by Aliko Dangote through his company, Dangote Group. Ardika explained that the trucks would be imported into Nigeria to serve as means of transportation to rural communities. He said the vehicles would be used by farmers and others in Nigeria’s agricultural value chain, to transport water, cassava, and seed processors. “Dangote’s team will check three units as a sample to be brought to Africa at the end of January. “The trucks are set to be exported over five years, with 1,000 units to be exported this year and next year,” Putu said.

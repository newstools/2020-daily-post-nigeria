President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday, congratulated the current World Heavyweight Boxing Champion, Anthony Joshua. He met with Joshua at a meeting with a select group of the Nigerian Community in the United Kingdom. Buhari hailed AJ, as he’s fondly called, on regaining his world championship belt. The president said the boxer put Nigeria “on the world map again like Hogan Bassey.” Joshua, who later presented his belts to the President, pledged to “stand up for Nigeria anytime you need me.” On security, Buhari stated that “it is common sense that you can only run the country if it is secured,” adding that the country “has not done badly in the North East.” The president said that his administration has now focused on retrieving stolen fixed assets and returning the proceeds of the sale “to the treasury through the Treasury Single Account (TSA),” so that nobody can return them back to the convicts even after his tenure.

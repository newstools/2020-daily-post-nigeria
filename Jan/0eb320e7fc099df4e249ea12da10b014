Two unidentified middle-aged men have been burnt to death by an angry mob along Akai Effa road opposite Orange Resorts in Calabar Municipality LGA. DAILY POST gathered that the two victims were caught at about 4:00 am on Monday while robbing a barber’s shop very close to the popular resort. An eyewitness, Miss Linda Akpan said the duo have been terrorising the area for months now but met their waterloo. She said:”They have been terrorising the neighbourhood for months. Just few days ago, they robbed a phone shop, carting away all the phones in the shop including accessories. “The boys in the neighbourhood decided to increase surveillance in the area and the vigilante caught them right in the act while they were trying to cart away a plasma television, generator amongst other things. “They made them call their people before setting them ablaze this morning to serve as a warning to others with the intention to do the same,” she said. When our reporter visited the scene, their family members were seen trying to remove their remains from the place at about 3:00 pm with heavy police presence. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Irene Ugbo who confirmed the incident warned residents not to take laws into their hands. “The incident is quite unfortunate and a pathetic one. I don’t really understand why some people will want to continually live a life of crime even in the beginning of a new year, instead of thinking of more productive things to do. “But the public must understand that it is wrong to take laws into their hands, they should always hand such people to the police for justice to take its course,” she said.

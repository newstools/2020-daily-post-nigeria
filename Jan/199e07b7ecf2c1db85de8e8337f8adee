Barcelona manager, Quique Setien has reacted to his side’s La Liga 2-0 defeat to Valencia on Saturday. Valencia defeated Barcelona, thanks to Maxi Gomez’s strike and an Jordi Alba own goal at Mestalla. It is Setien’s first defeat as Barcelona manager in just his second La Liga game in charge after replacing Ernesto Valverde some days ago. “The reality is that we did not play well at all, especially in the first half,” Setien said at his post-match press conference. “We couldn’t get near their goal and at certain moments we did not understand each other well and Valencia made the most of our mistakes. “We made a lot of passes for the sake of making them and were not capable of causing any damage.”

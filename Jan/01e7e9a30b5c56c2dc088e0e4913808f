Manchester United face being priced out of a move for Bruno Fernandes. The Evening Standard reports that United are at an advanced stage in negotiations with the player, but are wary of a bidding war with Tottenham. The Red Devils believe they were used to try and drive up Fernandesâ€™ price in the summer, with Sporting Lisbon keen to squeeze every penny out of their captain. However, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is desperate for a midfielder this month and is keen for the Portugal international to fill the gap in his squad. Solskjaer is dealing with an injury crisis, with seven players out, including first-choice centre midfield duo Paul Pogba and Scott McTominay.

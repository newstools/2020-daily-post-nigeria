Paris-Saint Germain are set to offer Pep Guardiola a mega deal to leave Manchester City this summer, the UK Express reports. The Spaniard is believed to be the preferred candidate for the French champions, if they sack Thomas Tuchel. Guardiola is contracted to City until the end of next season, but there has been increasing speculation this could be his last campaign with the Premier League champions. After winning an unprecedented domestic treble last term, his side now trail leaders Liverpool by 13 points following Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace. And the Reds have played two games less ahead of their home clash with Manchester United on Sunday. Guardiola has insisted he is “100%” staying at the Etihad, but PSG’s mega-rich owners are ready to make a huge offer to lure him away.

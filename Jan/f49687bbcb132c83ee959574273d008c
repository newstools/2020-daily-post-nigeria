Iran has issued a strong warning that any US retaliation to its missile attacks on American targets in Baghdad would lead to an all-out war in the Middle East. Hessameddin Ashena, an adviser to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani stated this on Wednesday. “Any adverse military action by the US will be met with an all out war across the region. The Saudis, however, could take a different path – they could have total peace!” Ashena said in a statement on Twitter. Also, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said on Twitter that his country took what it considered to be proportionate measures and does not seek an escalation of war. Iran fired more than a dozen rockets at two Iraqi military bases hosting US troops on Wednesday. The attacks follow assassination of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad on Friday. Iran had vowed severe retailiation. The rockets fired at the Ain al-Asad base in Anbar province and a base in Erbil early on Wednesday came amid escalating tensions between Tehran and Washington. “Iran took & concluded proportionate measures in self-defense under Article 51 of UN Charter targeting base from which cowardly armed attack against our citizens & senior officials were launched. “We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression,” Zarif tweeted.

A father identified as Ogar Ogbudu has allegedly poured acid on more than twenty seven (27) people for allegedly bullying his Son (name withheld) in Yala local government area of Cross River State. DAILY POST gathered that the incident occurred at Ugaga community in Yala local government area where some group of teenagers were having fun. An eyewitness, Omgbidu Savour told our reporter on Tuesday that fight broke out between the teenagers and Ogbudu’s son who later came with acid to spray on the other kids, leaving them ferociously injured. Saviour said, “Some peers, 14 to 15 years of age went to Ugaga picnic and and fought each other. After the picnic, one of the boys went home and equipped himself with weapons and charm with a view to attack others. When the boy who went to fortify himself came back, other boys including one of the victims discovered that the boy was with weapons and charm, so they started interrogating him. “After they interrogated him, they decided to send somebody to his father to come and see as well as hear what his son was handling and what he was going to do. “When the father (Ogar Ogbudu) came, he came with a substance suspected to be acid in a container and poured on everybody who gathered to resolve the crisis and innocent people got burnt by the substance (acid).” “The victims were more than 27 in number and were rushed to the General hospital in Igoli, Ogoja local government area of the state, same night. The perpetrator was captured by the youths in the community and was questioned by the elders – he was beaten with machetes too”, Omgbidu said. When newsmen contacted the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) DSP Irene Ugbo, she said that she was yet to be briefed on the incident and promised to contact the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in Yala.

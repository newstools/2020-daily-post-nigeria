A Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, aspirant for the February Local Government election in Enugu State, Hon. Chineme Onyeke has expressed anger over the party’s non-release of guidelines and time table for the election. Onyeke had earlier alleged of plot by the party to print only one chairmanship form for each of the 17 local government areas in the State. He has now declared that the non release of guidelines has affected his campaign plans. In a letter he addressed to the Chairman of the PDP in the State, Chief Augustine Nnamani, Onyeke recalled that he had on 10th Dec, 2019, forwarded a letter to the chairman, indicating his intention to stand for election during the PDP congress to elect the Party Flag bearer for the chairmanship of Nsukka Local Government Council in the forthcoming Local government elections. He said “Under the timetable released by ESIEC , all political parties shall publish the dates for their primaries which must hold between Jan 15th and 21st , 2020.” The aspirant expressed surprise that “less than ten (10) days to the commencement of the primaries, the Peoples Democratic Party under your chairmanship has not published guidelines and dates for purchase of Nomination Forms and schedule for the ward and local government congresses. “The situation has negatively affected my campaign programmes and my campaign organisation has fears that attempts are being orchestrated by the State leadership of our great party to shut me out the contest against the express provisions of the Constitution of PDP as amended. “I sincerely urge the State Chairman to use his good offices and ensure that the PDP guidelines for the ward and Local government congresses are published without further delay to enable me perform my democratic rights of presenting my aspiration to the party delegates during the primaries.”

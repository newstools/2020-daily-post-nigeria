The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives will send formal impeachment charges against President Donald Trump to the Senate next week. Reuters reports that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said this on Friday. In a letter to House lawmakers, Pelosi said she has asked House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler to “be prepared to bring to the Floor next week a resolution to appoint managers and transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate.” “I will be consulting with you at our Tuesday House Democratic Caucus meeting on how we proceed further”. The House impeached Trump in December 2019 on charges that he abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a domestic political rival and obstructed efforts by
Congress to investigate the alleged misconduct. Pelosi has withheld the charges, known formally as articles of impeachment, for weeks in a bid to pressure Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to divulge details of his plan for a Senate trial. Pelosi on Friday accused McConnell of “intentions to stonewall a fair trial” by signing onto Senate legislation that would dismiss the charges against Trump and thus short-circuit the trial. “A dismissal is a cover-up and deprives the American people of the truth,” Pelosi said in her letter. McConnell has said Pelosi cannot tell the Senate how to conduct the trial.

Victor Moses has left Chelsea on loan for Inter Milan. The Serie A club on Thursday, confirmed that the Nigerian will wear the No.11 shirt. The 29-year-old becomes Antonio Conte’s fourth signing after Romelu Lukaku, Alexis Sanchez and Ashley Young. Moses played 78 times in over two seasons when Conte was at Stamford Bridge. After Conte’s sacking by the Londoners in 2018, Moses struggled to break into the first team under Maurizio Sarri, before exiting to join Fenerbahce on an 18-month loan deal in January 2019. “I’m happy to be here. I’ll give my all and want to help the team. “There’s a lot of quality here, I want to make my contribution out on the pitch and enjoy myself. That’s the most important thing,” Moses told Inter TV.

Chief Dan Orbih, Edo State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party( PDP), has urged members of the party not to be deterred by those who decamped to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The PDP had expelled its former governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, who recently joined the APC. Orbih, at a rally in Owan West Local Government on Saturday, noted that those who left the party did so in confusion because they were not accepted in their new home. “I want to use this opportunity to clear some issues that I know are bothering you. Today, I can saintly say that those few people who left us for APC are now in political poverty. “They are not in hell, they are not in heaven, they are not in PDP, they are not in APC,” he said. NAN reports that Orbih appealed to party members and the electorate to make the right decision in the forthcoming governorship election by choosing a PDP candidate “because of the abysmal failure of the APC led government in almost all sectors of the economy in the state”. He also faulted the alleged attempt of APC leaders in the state to dissociate themselves from the failures of the APC government in Edo. “They admitted that the APC government in Edo State has failed but they now want to situate it on the personality of Gov. Godwin Obaseki. “Who brought Obaseki, Adams Oshiomole; can we separate Obaseki from Oshiomole? No. So it is clear that APC in Edo state has failed. In their failure, they must admit and accept that their time is up,” he said.

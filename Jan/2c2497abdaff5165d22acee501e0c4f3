Former Manchester United left-back, Patrice Evra has urged midfielder, Paul Pogba to leave the club immediately in order to end the ‘negativity’ surrounding him at Old Trafford. Evra said this after former Red Devils midfielder, Roy Keane criticised Pogba following Man United’s Premier League 2-0 defeat to Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday. Speaking as a pundit on Sky Sports, Keane had described Pogba, who did not featured in United’s defeat against Liverpool, as a ‘nuisance’ at Old Trafford. Keane said: “United over the last year, they will be inconsistent. “They’re with younger players, they have had injuries. They’ve got Pogba in the background who’s been a nuisance. You’ve got to get rid of these people in your club and that doesn’t happen overnight. Players are running the show.” Reacting to the development, Evra claimed the 26-year-old France World Cup winner is blamed for the club’s problems whether he is playing or not. “To be fair, when he’s playing people blame Paul. When he’s not playing, people blame Paul,” Evra told Sky Sports. “I don’t agree with Roy, but when you are a problem for the club – for example when I kicked the fan in Marseille, the owner and the manager they come and say ‘Patrice, what are we going to do now?’ I say I’m leaving. I don’t want to bring any negativity to the club. “And right now, maybe it will be time for Paul to leave. “I remember when it was a big game, Liverpool vs Man United. People were talking more about Jose Mourinho and Paul Pogba. This is insulting. For the biggest two clubs in the world, we’re talking about one player and one manager. “I think sometimes it’s time. When you play, they blame you. When you’re not playing they blame you also. I think maybe Paul already said to Man United ‘I want to leave’ and they don’t let him go.”

The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has developed the Commercial Satellite Communications Guidelines for the telecommunications industry in Nigeria. A statement by Henry Nkemadu, NCC Director, Public Affairs, recalled that the policy came into effect in November 2018. “In line with the provisions of Section 13 of the Commercial Satellite Communications Guidelines, the Commission to date, has issued Landing Permits to 55 Space Stations providing coverage over Nigeria’s territory”, he said. This list of authorised Space Stations with permit to provide coverage over Nigeria is available on the Commission’s website. NCC urged all relevant stakeholders and perators in the Nigerian telecommunications market to take note of the information.

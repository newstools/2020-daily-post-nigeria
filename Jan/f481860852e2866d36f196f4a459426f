Special Adviser on Political Matters to Edo State Governor, Osaro Idah, has alleged that National Chairman of the, All Progressives Congress (APC) Comrade Adams Oshiomle blocked Governor Godwin Obaseki from getting federal appointments. He spoke on Thursday at a meeting with ward leaders in Oredo Local Government Area. Idaho said Oshiomhole ensured that none of Obaseki’s nominees got a slot. He revealed that out of the eight federal slots assigned to Edo State, the governor recommended only one person, but Oshiomhole still interfered and the person was dropped. “Edo had eight slots for its indigenes for federal appointments, but Comrade Adams Oshiomhole filled all the positions”, Vanguard quoted Idah as saying. The only nominee the governor submitted for National Population Commission (NPC) Comrade Oshiomhole replaced him with his person.” “I urge you to support your son and never allow anyone treat him anyhow. Possess your possession”, he urged the APC ward leaders.

Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, has admitted Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang deserved to be sent off, during their 1-1 draw with Crystal Palace on Saturday. Aubameyang was shown a straight red card in the second half after a VAR check, following a rash tackle on Max Meyer. The Gabon striker had earlier fired Arsenal in front, before Jordan Ayew earned a point for the home side. And Arteta told BT Sport: “I was really pleased with the first half. “We conceded the goal where we switched off completely. That is unacceptable and I’m really upset with that. “We reacted very well after conceding the goal. “After Auba’s red card we were the team I expected because everybody was at it. “I haven’t seen it but I think it was a harsh challenge. There is no intention to do it but maybe he mistimed it.”

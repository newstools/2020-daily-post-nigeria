Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed captain Harry Kane will be out until April, with the player set to have surgery on his left hamstring. Kane, who has 11 Premier League goals so far this season, limped off during their 1-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day. It means je will miss most of the remaining games in the Premier League, with Spurs battling to finish in the top four. “Following ongoing assessment by our medical staff over the past week, we can confirm that Harry Kane will undergo surgery to repair a ruptured tendon in his left hamstring. “The striker suffered the injury during our Premier League fixture against Southampton last week and specialists have advised surgery after further review of the injury. “The decision to undergo surgery is not expected to impact the timeframe that the England captain will be sidelined, with the expectation that he will return to training in April,” Spurs said in a statement.

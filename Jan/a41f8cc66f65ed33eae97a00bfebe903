AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic on Saturday made history after scoring a goal in his side’s Serie A 2-0 victory over Cagliari. Ibrahimovic, who re-joined AC Milan in this January’s transfer window a few days ago, netted the second goal of the encounter in the 64 minute after Rafael Leao had given the Italian giants the lead just after half time. According to the Daily Mail, Ibrahimovic’s goal against Cagliari means the Swedish striker has now scored in four different decades after first scoring for Malmo against Vastra Frolunda back in 1999. It was also the 475th goal of his career so far. The 38-year-old has played for nine different clubs in his extraordinary career so far. He has played in Sweden, Holland, Italy, France, England and the USA. The former Manchester United star will now hope to lead Milan to victory when they host Udinese on January 19.

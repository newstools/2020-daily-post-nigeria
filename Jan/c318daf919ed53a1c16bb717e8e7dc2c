Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hit back at former team-mate, Gary Neville, who called for the sack of the executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward Neville made the comments after United lost 2-0 to Liverpool at Anfield on Sunday, expressing his displeasure at the club’s recruitment since Woodward took over in 2013. However, Solskjaer speaking to the media on Tuesday, insisted the team is making “strides forward”. He said: “Now is not the time to speak about recruitment. We’re looking to the next game against Burnley. “We’re always looking to improve the squad and to improve the club but for my mind, now is not the time, Gary, to start this discussion.” United host Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday night, five points adrift of Champions League places.

Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has called for his side to improve their finishing, following a 1-0 win over Real Valladolid on Sunday. Los Blancos clinched all three points at Estadio Jose Zorrilla, thanks to a late Nacho goal. The result moved Madrid three points clear at the top of LaLiga. Zidane praised his defence after Valladolid failed to register a shot on target, but said more creativity is required. “Defensively, what we are doing, we are doing well. It is our strength. “We defend all and when we lose the ball we recover it very high, and if we keep it we have a good chance of scoring. “Nacho scored and that is part of football. We know that we can improve in this aspect. “Nacho is a professional. When he has to compete he does well. I’m glad for his goal; he doesn’t usually score them but from time-to-time we can also create chances for defenders,” Zidane told reporters. The Frenchman then refused to be drawn on his side’s title chances, despite opening up a gap over rivals Barcelona, who lost 2-0 to Valencia on Saturday. “For us, nothing changes. We are happy with the victory, the work done having fought until the end, but nothing changes. There are 17 games left and we will continue fighting until the end. “I don’t want to talk about being champions because there is still a lot left to play. It changes nothing to be leaders, they are three important points but nothing more. “There are a lot of league games left and it will be difficult for all teams, including us,” Zidane added.

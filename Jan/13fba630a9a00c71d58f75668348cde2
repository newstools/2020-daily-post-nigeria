The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has counseled Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to stop pushing the party’s third term discourse in the public space. PDP warned Oshiomhole to “desist from going to the Presidential villa to push the impossible as such will not save him from the axe of suspension dangling over his political head” or his inescapable prosecution over allegations of corruption and mismanagement of Edo state resources while he was governor of that state. A statement by PDP’s spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan said such “mission to the Villa, like the one Oshiomhole made today, will also not save the APC from fizzling before 2023, as even alluded to by President Muhammadu Buhari in his apprehensions about the gloomy future of the the APC.” The statement reads: “Mr. Oshiomhole should therefore stop sounding like a broken brass in his attempt to launder a failed merchandise. “Of course, Nigerians need not be reminded, of the exit date of an administration that has caused them so much pains, abused our law, trampled on their rights and undermined our electoral process. “It would interest Oshiomhole to know that if anything, Nigerians are already counting days for May 29, 2023, when the APC and the Buhari administration will be consigned to the dustbin of history. “Oshiomhole should therefore accept the fact that Nigerians have moved ahead towards 2023 and that the APC is not in their equation.”

Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA) on Monday confirmed that there was a minor earth tremor in Bwari Area of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Mr Imam Kaka, a Deputy Director in the agency and head of Geophysics Department who confirmed the development to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Abuja said officials of the agency had visited Bwari to evaluate the situation. Kaka said that although vibrations had occurred in the area, there was no visible crack. He urged residents of the area not to panic. “We found out that there was a little tremor recorded by our equipment dated January 12, 2020 and it occurred around 5.20 p.m. “On that basis, we mobilised and went to the locality in Bwari Area Council of the FCT. “Certainly, the people in the area were agitated, but the tremor was minor, it did not affect their structures, we were able to look at the geology of the structure. “We will look at the geology of the structure with other geologists to see what really happened geologically,” he said. Kaka said that officials of the agency were able to calm residents of the area, telling them that it was usual to feel small tremor. He said such minor tremors were not considered serious in areas where earthquakes were rampant. DAILY POST recalls that the agency had on Saturday, dismissed reports from an unidentified Professor from Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun, that there was earth tremor in Abaji and Gwagwalada areas of the FCT. Kaka had said that the agency’s equipment had not recorded any such occurrence. “We have a station in the University of Abuja in Gwagwalada, and the officer in charge who heads the University’s Physics Department said there was no such record. “We even questioned people around Abaji and Gwagwalada and there was no report of such, unlike before when we will receive calls from people when such thing happened,” he said.

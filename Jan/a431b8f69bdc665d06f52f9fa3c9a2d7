Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba could reportedly leave the club to join Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan this January’s transfer window. According to the Sunday Mirror, Man United are willing to sign Inter Milan striker, Lautaro Martinez as the Serie A club target Pogba. The newspaper reports that Man United’s chiefs have registered their interest in Martinez and are willing to use Pogba as leverage in order to land the 22-year-old Argentine. The Red Devils manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to bolster his attacking options after he failed to replace Romelu Lukaku, who joined Inter last summer. Martinez, who currently plays alongside Lukaku at Inter, has been in excellent form this season. He has scored 13 goals in 21 appearances for Conte’s side so far this season. Pogba is currently down with an ankle injury and will be out of action in the next couple of weeks.

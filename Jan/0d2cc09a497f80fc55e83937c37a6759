Egypt, on Friday denounced protesters’ attack on the US embassy in Baghdad over America’s airstrike that killed Iranian Maj. General Qassem Soleimani. Egypt’s Foreign Ministry stated this in a statement. According to the statement, “Egypt voiced its deep concerns over the assault,” stressing that “the attack violates international conventions.” Egypt then called for protection of diplomatic buildings, urging “all parties in Iraq to distance themselves from any international and regional tensions that could negatively affect the country’s security and stability.” Earlier, the US embassy suspended public consular services until further notice, as a result of an attack by the Iranian-backed protesters on the diplomatic compound. On Friday, Maj.-Gen. Soleimani, Commander of the Quds Force of Iran’s Islamic Revolution Guards Corps, was killed in a US air strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport.

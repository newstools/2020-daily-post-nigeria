Winner of Big Brother Africa (BBA) All Stars edition, Uti Nwachukwu has attacked Pastor Enoch Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, RCCG, for advising his son to sack his secretary. DAILY POST had reported that Adeboye on Twitter said he advised one of his sons to sack his secretary because he (Son) became too fond of her and was always excited to see her at work. Adeboye was quoted as saying, ”One of my sons once told me that he was always excited to resume in the office every Monday because he would get to see his secretary again.” Reacting, Uti on his Twitter page described religion in the country as a ‘big joke.’ He said, “You ask your son to fire an innocent woman because your son cannot discipline himself/his feelings? “Tomorrow the same people will say we should rise and pray against anyone blocking our progress. We have heard now.”

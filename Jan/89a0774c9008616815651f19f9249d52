European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, on Friday, warned Britain not to expect to cherry-pick in trade negotiations with the European Union as grappling over London’s future relations kicks off. According to the top EU official in Zagreb, when it comes to access to the EU’s single market – the world’s largest trade bloc there is a difference between being a member state and not. “If Britain wants to end the free movement of people, for example, it should not expect the free movement of goods, services and capital. “There will be trade-offs between market access and how far Britain wants to diverge from EU regulations once the Brexit transition period ends and London is free to forge its own trade deals or change its laws,’’ Dpa quoted her as saying. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson insisted that mammoth negotiations on all aspects of the future relations be wrapped up by the end of the year, leaving an 11-month time frame that the EU says is unrealistic. On Thursday, the EU’s lead negotiator Michel Barnier said that the bloc should prioritise a trade agreement and a framework for cooperation on fighting crime and terrorism. Barnier said the commission would be ready on Feb. 1 to propose a negotiating mandate, and expected talks to open in late February or early March.

Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has reacted to Premier League decision to commence the use of pitchside monitors. The German welcomed the announcement that Premier League referees will now be encouraged to use pitchside monitors to help with VAR decisions. Referees have basically relied on information from the VAR officials to make their decisions even though monitors have been stationed at the side of the pitch in each top-flight match since the introduction of VAR in the Premier League at the beginning of this season. Those officials – who are stationed at the Premier League HQ in Stockley Park – have been making their calls based on numerous television replays before advising the on-pitch referee on what to do. It is felt that the on-pitch referee consulting the screen in order to make their own decision is a preferable option as that official will have a feel for the game. Liverpool boss, Klopp, whose side take on Manchester United at Anfield this weekend, is one Premier League boss who is behind the move. “The Only reason for having it is to use it. I don’t know why they aren’t used so far,” said Klopp on Friday. “We want the right decisions so we should use all sources. It won’t happen five or six times a game. It’s just about 100% clarification that is needed.”

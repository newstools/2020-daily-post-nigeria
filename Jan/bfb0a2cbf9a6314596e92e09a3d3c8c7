Lillian Daniel Gyang, a 100-level student of Zoology at the University of Maiduguri (UNIMAID), Borno State, who was abducted two weeks ago, is still in the custody of Boko Haram. Intelligence sources confirmed this on Sunday. Lillian, 20, is of Berom ethnic group in Barkin Ladi Local Government Area (LGA), of Plateau State. She was abducted on January 9, 2020, on her way to Maiduguri alongside Ropvil Dalep, a Biology student at UNIMAID. While Dalep has been executed by the insurgents, Lilian is reported to still be alive. Both undergraduates were seized while returning to school after the Christmas and New Year holidays. The information on Lillian’s continued captivity came hours after news of Leah Sharibu’s baby delivery broke. Leah and others were kidnapped from the Government Girls’ Science and Technical College, Dapchi, Bursari Local Government Area of Yobe state on February 19, 2018. PRNigeria reports that efforts are being made by relevant agencies and stakeholders towards the safe release of Leah, Lillian and other captives. A source said: “The insurgents and their commanders have since devised a clever, deceptive and persuasive way to entice and woo girls and women whom they love and separate them from those confined to forced labour and sex-slavery after their abduction. “Leah Sharibu was not coaxed or forced to renounce her faith. According to the information, we gathered she willingly accepted the man and converted. She was not raped serially by anyone but willingly submitted herself to one of the insurgents through enticement.”

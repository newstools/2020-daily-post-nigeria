Three men were on Wednesday arraigned before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos State, over alleged possession of two human skulls. The defendants, Kazeem Olanrewaju, 27; Amidu Kazeem, 38; and Muritala Salami, 43, are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and unlawful possession of human parts. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Modupe Olaluwoye, told the court that the defendants committed the offences at 6.00 p.m. on Nov. 21, 2019, along Adeniji Adele Road, Lagos. She told the court that the second and third defendants were caught in possession of two human skulls in a black nylon, which they had earlier claimed contained biscuits. NAN reports that Olaluwoye said that the two defendants later confessed to having purchased the skulls from the first defendant, Olanrewaju, who was a cemetery worker. She said that the alleged offences contravened Sections 411 and 238 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). The Magistrate, Mrs S.O. Obasa, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N1 million each, with two sureties in like sum. She said that one of each sureties must be a blood relation to each defendant, and that both sureties should be gainfully employed. Obasa also directed that the sureties should reside within the court’s jurisdiction, and show evidence of three years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case was adjourned until Jan. 20, for mention.

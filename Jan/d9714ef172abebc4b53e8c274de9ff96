Security agencies must go after those who are behind these attacks and their sponsors so they can face the law and be taught a lesson. “We do not need another circle of bloodshed in Plateau State as all well-meaning citizens have committed to peaceful coexistence and tolerance. “My administration will not allow anyone, no matter how highly placed to jeopardise this peace,” NAN quoted him as saying.

Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has confirmed that he will send an under-23 team to play the FA Cup fourth round replay against Shrewsbury Town. The Reds threw away a two-goal lead at the New Meadow on Sunday, to draw 2-2 with the League One opposition. Curtis Jones’ goal and Donald Love own goal gave Liverpool a 2-0 lead, but supersub Jason Cummings came off the bench to score twice for the hosts. The replay falls in the middle of the Premier League’s February winter break and Klopp plans to respect that rest period by missing the game along with his first-team stars. “Our situation is the following. We’ve known for a couple of weeks, in fact we’ve known longer, that it would be like this,” he told BBC Sport. “In April 2019 we got a letter from the Premier League, I think, where they asked us to respect the winter break and not to organise international friendlies or competitive games. We respect that. “So I said to the boys already two weeks ago that we will have a winter break which means we will not be there. It will be the kids who play that game. “You cannot deal with us like nobody cares about it. I know that it’s not very popular but that’s the way I see it. “The Premier League asked us to respect the winter break. That’s what we do. If the FA doesn’t respect that, then we cannot change it. We will not be there. “Does that mean I won’t be there? Yes. [U-23 coach] Neil Critchley will be in charge.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has slammed his critics following their 6-0 win over Tranmere in the FA Cup fourth round. Speaking to the media after the game, Solskjaer claimed that “it wasn’t just the Tranmere people” who wanted an upset on Sunday. First-half goals from Harry Maguire, Diogo Dalot, Jesse Lingard, Phil Jones and Anthony Martial ended the game as a contest. Mason Greenwood added another from the penalty spot in the second half, to seal an emphatic victory. Solskjaer was under pressure ahead of the Tranmere game, after consecutive defeats to Liverpool and Burnley in the Premier League. “It wasn’t just the Tranmere people who wanted an upset, there were a lot of others,” Solskjaer said. “You can see everyone wanted us to fail but it doesn’t bother me. I can’t be up and down [emotionally]. I’m happy but won’t relax.” When asked about what he was most proud of following the win, Solskjaer said: “I think the players, the way they went about the game on that pitch. We played football the way it should be played and it was an exceptional performance at times because that pitch was very, very difficult to play on.”

There is palpable tension among residents of Ogun State as Lassa fever reportedly killed a 26-year-old woman, Titilayo Akinsola on Saturday. She died of the hemorrhagic fever in Abeokuta, the state capital. This is coming barely three days after the Ogun State Government denied outbreak of the disease in the state. DAILY POST learnt that the victim, who was reportedly taken to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Idi-aba Abeokuta, died on Saturday. The Spokesperson of the FMC, Segun Orisajo, confirmed the death to newsmen, saying the deceased was admitted to the hospital and series of tests showed she had Lassa fever. Orisajo hinted that the victim died after attempts by the medical team of the hospital to save her life failed. “Yes, she [the victim] was rushed to the hospital four days ago and series of tests confirmed that she had Lassa fever. “Our medical team did everything possible to save her life but unfortunately she died,” he said. Our correspondent reports that the death comes few days after the State Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, denied a report by the Nigeria Center for Disease Control, which designated Ogun as one of the states with cases of Lassa Fever in the country. However, when contacted to confirm the incident on Saturday, Coker was quoted as saying, “It is true. Someone died of Lassa fever in the State today (Saturday).” Coker declined further comments, saying it could trigger panic in the state.

A local vigilante in Jada Local Government Area of Adamawa State has been killed by suspected kidnappers. DAILY POST gathered Tuesday that the vigilante, Haruna Gamjango, had fatally shot three suspected kidnappers who attacked him at his residence at Jarandi, Mayo Ine ward of Jada, before he was himself shot and killed by other members of the kidnapping gang that turned up on him. A source said the suspected kidnappers stormed the residence of the vigilante, known in the committee as a fearless crime fighter, around 11 pm on Monday and attempted to snatch him at gunpoint. The source said, “The suspected kidnappers knocked on his door and when he opened, they made attempts to take him away. He resisted them and they shot directly at him, but the shots were not potent. ”The gallant man shot three of his attackers. One died on the spot while the two others died later as a result of the injury he inflicted on them. ”They came in large numbers, so other attackers who had stayed outside, came over and together they overpowered the slain vigilante and killed him.” Another source who identified himself as Mohammad Chubado, said one of the dead suspects is a resident of the area who was a known criminal. ”One of the dead assailants was recently released after he spent over 10 months in detention following his involvement in kidnapping. “In fact, he was released about three months ago only to be involved in another attempted kidnapping,” Chubado said.

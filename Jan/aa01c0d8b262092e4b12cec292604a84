The Dispatch Officer of Kaduna State Planning and Budget Commission, Mr Danjuma Tunkuye, has received the commission’s 2019 Best Performing Administrative Staff Award. The commissioner, Mr Thomas Gyang, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Kaduna on Monday that Tunkuye was given N20,000 cash as incentive to encourage him and for others to emulate his outstanding performance. According to him, the commission has introduced an annual award scheme to recognise outstanding members of staff as part of efforts to motivate workers for optimal performance in the discharge of their responsibilities. Gyang explained that when he took over in July 2019, he met a responsible team of professionals in all the departments of the commission. According to him, having a team of well motivated staff is crucial to the attainment of the commission’s mandate. He said: “So, we decided to instill work discipline into the staffers and the first thing we addressed was the issue of being punctual to work. “This is because we noticed some workers come to work around 9 a.m, and others around 10 a.m, instead of 8 a.m, while some disappear before the closing hour. “With that kind of attitude, work will suffer and giving the crucial role of the commission in governance, if you neglect any piece of work in the agency, the entire state will suffer.”

The Supreme Court on Monday, dismissed the appeal challenging the return of Simon Lalong as duly elected Governor of Plateau State. The court in a unanimous judgment held that the appellants, Sen. Jeremiah Useni and the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, failed to prove allegations made against the victory of Lalong of APC in the March 9 governorship election in Plateau. The apex court in the unanimous judgment delivered by Justice Adamu Galinje accordingly affirmed the election of Lalong as duly elected governor of Plateau. Details laterâ€¦

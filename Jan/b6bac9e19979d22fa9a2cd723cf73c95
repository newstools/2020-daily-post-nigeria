The Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, has described those afraid of Operation Amotekun as criminals. Spokesman of the organisation, Yinka Odumakin said only those troubling the Southwest should be afraid of the establishment of Amotekun. Odumakin also assured those who are not criminals not to be troubled by the establishment of Amotekun. Featuring on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily, the Afenifere spokesperson explained that Amotekun was for the protection of the ordinary people within the Southwest. “Those who are afraid are criminals troubling the Southwest,” Odumakin stated. He also contended that security was not on the Executive List as been made to believe, adding that security was the responsibility of every Nigerian citizen. Stressing that there is no hidden agenda for setting up Amotekun, Odumakin said the security outfit was to “secure lives and property, to aid the police where the police have failed, to fill in the gap”. This is coming at a time when Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore group, had revealed that its members are afraid of Amotekun. National Secretary of the group, Alhassan Saleh had disclosed that they “fear” Amotekun because their members carrying out their economic business in the Southwest would be the target.

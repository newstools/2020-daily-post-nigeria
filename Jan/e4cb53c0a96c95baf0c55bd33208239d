The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), and the Department of State Services (DSS), Thursday, pledged to fight against Niger Delta oil thieves and other maritime related economic crimes. The anti-oil theft resolution was disclosed by the new EFCC PortHarcourt Zonal Head Office, Usman Imam, when he went on a familiarization visit to the Rivers State headquarters of the DSS located in the metropolis. EFCC acting spokesman, Tony Orilade said this in a statement in Abuja. Part of the statement reads, “Imam, who was received by the State Director of DSS, H.B Abdullahi, said the essence of the visit was to familiarize himself with the DSS leadership in the state with a view to deepening the existing partnership and collaboration between the two agencies. “I am new in Port Harcourt and will need the support of critical stakeholders in the state as the EFCC cannot do it alone,” Imam said. “He also assured the DSS of EFCC’s support towards the common objective of national safety and security. “Imam observed that the Niger Delta has peculiar economic crimes that are complex and multidimensional, which make effective deterrence much contingent on a robust synergy and cooperation among law enforcement agencies. In his response, however, Abdullahi pointed out that excellent relationship has been existing between the two organisations in the state and assured that it would continue. In his words, “Take it from me, the synergy is 100 percent. The relationship with EFCC has been wonderful and we hope it continues”.

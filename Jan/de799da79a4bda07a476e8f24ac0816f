Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane has provided latest update on forward, Eden Hazard’s injury ahead of his side’s La Liga clash with Getafe on Saturday. Zidane said the former Chelsea star will return to action for Real Madrid after their Spanish Super Cup clash against Valencia on January 8. Hazard suffered a “micro-fracture” in his ankle during the Los Blancos’ 2-2 draw against Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League at the Santiago Bernabeu last November. “Hazard is 100% out of the Spanish Super Cup,” Zidane was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying on Friday. “He won’t come with us, he’s working on his recovery at the moment. “I hope that soon after the Super Cup we can start to see him back with us.”

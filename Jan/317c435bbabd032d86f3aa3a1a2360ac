Everton have rejected €100m (£85m) offer from Barcelona for Richarlison, according Sky Sports. It is understood that the Toffees turned down the bid immediately, as they are not ready to part with one of their key players. Richarlison is a long-standing target of Barca’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, who enquired about the 22-year-old last summer. Abidal believes the Brazilian forward would complement Luis Suarez’s style of play. Barca are looking for a striker, after Suarez was ruled out for four months following knee surgery earlier in January. Richarlison joined Everton for £40m from Watford back in July 2018. He has scored 24 goals in 60 appearances for the Premier League side.

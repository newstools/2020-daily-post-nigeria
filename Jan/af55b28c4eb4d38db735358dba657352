Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo, SAN, on Tuesday met with South West Governors, the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami and the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, over the establishment of a regional security outfit, operation Amotekun. At the meeting, the Federal Governement agreed to set up a legal framework to legalise the establishment of a regional security outfit, operation Amotekun. A statement by Senior Special Assistant to the Vice President on Media and Publicity, Laolu Akande said it was agreed that the structure of Amotekun should also align with the Community Policing strategy of the Federal Government. “It was also agreed that necessary legal instruments will be put in place by each of the States to give legal backing to the initiative and address all issues concerning the regulation of the security structure,” he added. Amotekun, an initiative of Southwest Governors, was first declared illegal last Tuesday by the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami. The meeting is coming 24 hours after the national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, said Amotekun was not a threat to national unity.

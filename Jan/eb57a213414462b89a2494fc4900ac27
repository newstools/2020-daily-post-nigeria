The gubernatorial candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in the March 9th election in Oyo State, Akinwale Omololu Laosun, on Wednesday, urged Governor Seyi Makinde and the Chairmen of the 33 Local Government Areas and 35 Local Council Development Areas in the state to wait for the court decision on the crisis rocking local government administration in the state. Laosun, who decried the crisis between the state government and the local government chairmen who were sacked by Governor Seyi Makinde last year, said that it is only the court that can pronounce who are the rightful persons to occupy the local government seats and not any of the two warring groups.  The AAC gubernatorial candidate while speaking at an empowerment program for widows and widowers, organised by Akin and Funke Laosun Foundation, which was held in Ibadan, insisted that he cannot say who is right between the two warring groups. He then urged the State government and the Local Government Chairmen to wait for the Court decision instead of causing chaos in the state.  “What is important is that they should wait for the Court to decide. It is the Court that can make the final decision. They should wait for the Court to make the final decision. “When the final decision is made, if it favours the state government so be it, and if it does not, so be it. “They just have to wait for the court to decide. So it is not an issue of I am in one side or the other side. But, let the Court game the final decision.”

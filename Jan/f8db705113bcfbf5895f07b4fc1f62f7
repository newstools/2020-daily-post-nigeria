A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Enugu State, Comrade Adolphus Ude has urged the Ben-Nwoye-led leadership of the party in the State to stop distracting the President Muhammdu Buhari administration with the 2023 presidency contest. DAILY POST reports that Ude belongs to the Enugu APC leadership under Deacon Okey Ogbodo. In a statement he made available to DAILY POST in Abuja, Ude said it was too early for Nwoye and his team to be fanning embers of unity over the 2023 presidency. This is following the Nwoye-led APC’s endorsement of the minister of science and technology, Chief Ogbonnaya Onu for the 2023 presidency. Reacting, Ude, who is the pioneer Deputy Chairman of the party in the State, said it was “unfortunate that this should come from Ben Nwoye when the position of state Chairman is still pending at Appeal Court Enugu. He should stop issuing statements on behalf of APC Enugu state. “We find it curious that anyone, least of all, Ben Nwoye should begin to fan ember of disunity in our great party, to such extent that he is now appropriating to himself power he does not have – deciding who becomes President. “It is necessary to ask pertinent questions which bothers on who actually is working for the APC. Nwoye should start by telling us how many votes he got for our party in the 2019 election, when compared to our leader, Mr. Geoffrey Onyeama, who remains the pillar of the APC in Enugu State.” He called on Nwoye and others “to stop distracting the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. He should be allowed the air to face issues of governance, which he is creditably delivering to Nigerians.”

Arsenal have begun talks with Layvin Kurzawa, with a view to signing the Paris-Saint Germain defender on a free transfer in the summer, RMC reports. The 27-year-old is out of contract in less than six months and is unlikely to be offered a new deal by the French champions. Kurzawa is currently free to speak with foreign clubs and the Gunners have already registered an interest. Arsenal head coach, Mikel Arteta, is said to have given his approval for the signing of the left-back and the Premier League side could yet submit an offer to PSG before the end of the month if their injury crisis continues to worsen. Arsenal spent £25million on Kieran Tierney in the summer, but injuries have restricted the former Celtic star to just 11 appearances this season. Tierney is not expected to back in full training until March, after he dislocated his shoulder against West Ham in December. The club’s only other recognised left-back, Sead Kolasinac, is nursing an ankle injury.

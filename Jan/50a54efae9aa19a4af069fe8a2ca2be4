Iranian state television has quoted a senior Revolutionary Guards Corps as claiming that at least 80 “American terrorists” were killed in missile attacks on US bases on Wednesday. Iran launched 15 missiles on US targets in Iraq in retaliation to the death of Qassem Soleimani, who was buried on Wednesday. The television added that none of the missiles were intercepted by US troops, according to Al Jazeera. The claim could not be independently verified and the state television did not provide evidence of how it obtained that information. Citing a senior Revolutionary Guards Corps source, the state television also said “Iran had 100 other targets in the region in its sights if Washington took any retaliatory measures.” It also said “US helicopters and military equipment were severely damaged.” US had since reacted to the attack after Iran announced that it carried out “a successful operation called Operation Martyr Soleimani, with the code Oh Zahra”.

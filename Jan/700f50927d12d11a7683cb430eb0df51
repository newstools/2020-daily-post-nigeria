Hundreds of young men armed with guns on Friday invaded Danancha village in Gasol Local Government Area of Taraba State, killing two persons, burning over hundred houses and destroying other property worth millions of Naira. Consequently, many residents were displaced. The gunmen invaded the village at about 3pm and started burning houses, shooting sporadically without any provocation from residents.

It was also gathered that the gunmen carried out the destruction from 3pm to 6pm without been stopped by the joint security forces that have been stationed in the village. Another resident of Dananacha, Mr Jaspa Danu, while speaking with our correspondent said normalcy has returned to the village as more military forces were deployed to the area to control the situation.

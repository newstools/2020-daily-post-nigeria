Ajax star, Donny van de Beek, has ruled out a move to Manchester United or Real Madrid in this January’s transfer window. DAILY POST had reported that Van de Beek has drawn interest from Man United and Real Madrid in the past. Speaking on the development, the 22-year-old stated categorically that he would not be leaving Ajax this season or next season. “It is not that I can or want to do something at the moment,” Van de Beek told FOX Sports Netherlands. “I have said it before and I will say it again: I will remain at Ajax this season. And maybe next season as well. “These reports about Real Madrid or Man United are a good sign, but it is not important now. I’ve said I will stay at Ajax and I will do so for 100%.” Van de Beek has been impressive for Ajax so far this season. He helped Ajax to win the Dutch double last term and scored against Tottenham Hotspur in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals.

Lyon president, Jean-Michel Aulas, has ruled out a move for Moussa Dembele. Aulas insists the striker wants to fight for trophies at his current club. Dembele, 23, is one of Frank Lampard’s major targets this January, as he seeks to reinforce his squad. However, Lyon released an official statement last week confirming that Dembele was not for sale and Aulas reiterated the club’s stance on Wednesday afternoon. “We are not in a dramatic situation. It is difficult in terms of the content of our football but we are still in all the competitions,” Aulas told reporters. “We are going to try to strengthen. Our first reaction is to look to the youngsters in the academy who are playing and showing more. “The second is to sign players. The board has decided to do it but not at any price and not at all costs. We will only do deals that correspond with what our sporting director, board members and manager want. “Moussa Dembele will not leave because he wants to stay to win something with Lyon. “There have been offers for him and for other players but none of those that we want to keep will leave in January.”

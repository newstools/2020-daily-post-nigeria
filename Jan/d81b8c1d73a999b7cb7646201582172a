Kobe who used a helicopter to travel for years was known for commuting from Newport Beach, CA to the STAPLES Center in DTLA in his Sikorsky S-76 chopper. The former Los Angeles Lakers star described the news of Kobe’s death as ‘painful’ even as he described him as ‘a little brother, fierce competitor, one of the greats of the game and a creative force.” Jordan’s spokesperson in a statement wrote: “I am in shock over the tragic news of Kobe’s and Gianna’s passing. Words can’t describe the pain I’m feeling. I loved Kobe-he was like a little brother to me. “We used to talk often, and I will miss those conversations very much. He was a fierce competitor, one of the greats of the game and a creative force. “Kobe was also an amazing dad who loved his family deeply-and took great pride in his daughter’s love for the game of basketball. Yvette joins me in sending my deepest condolences to Vanessa, the Lakers organization and basketball fans around the world.”,

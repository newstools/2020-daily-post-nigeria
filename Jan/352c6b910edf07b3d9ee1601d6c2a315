Britain’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reached an agreement with his Iraq counterpart Adel Abdul Mahdi on the need to de-escalate tensions in the Middle East. Both leaders spoke by phone on Monday, according to a UK statement as reported by Al Jazeera. Johnson, who cut short his holiday at private island of Mustique and flew back to London on Sunday had earlier declared that Britain “will not lament” the death of Maj. Gen. Soleimani. The tension has been on the increase in the region, following the killing of Iranian army General, Qassem Soleimani by the US government. Soleimani’s death has resulted to series of war threats from both America and Iran with the Middle East country’s latest threat to retaliate the assassination of their general. DAILY POST earlier that multiple rockets were on Sunday launched near the US embassy in Baghdad Iraq Al Jazeera quoted Johnson as saying in a statement from the Prime Minister’s office, “The leaders discussed the need to de-escalate tensions in the region following the death of Qassem Soleimani and agreed to work together to find a diplomatic way forward.” “The Prime Minister underlined the UK’s unwavering commitment to Iraq’s stability and sovereignty and emphasised the importance of the continued fight against the shared threat from Daesh,” the statement said, using the Arabic acronym for ISIL.

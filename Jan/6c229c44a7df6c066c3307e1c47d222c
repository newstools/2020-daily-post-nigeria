The Ogun State Police Command on Sunday said it has nabbed three men for allegedly stealing a child in Ogun. Police said the suspects are: Abubakar Saidu, Danladi Abdulkarim, and Abdullah Idris. They were arrested for stealing a 4-year-old boy, Hammed Adeniran. Ogun Police Spokesperson, DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, in a statement on Sunday, explained that the arrest of the suspects followed a complaint by the mother of the child, Nimota Adeniran who reported at Warewa police station that she was alerted by one of her neighbours that her son was sighted with three strange men at Arepo bus stop along Lagos Ibadan expressway where they were waiting to board a vehicle to only God knows destination. Oyeyemi added that, upon the information, the mother started looking for her son only to discover that he is no longer where she left him. The PPRO said on the strength of the report, the DPO warewa division, SP Folake Afeniforo quickly mobilized a team of policemen and raced to the bus stop where the men were said to be waiting to board a vehicle. He said on getting there, the three men were met with the child in their possession and were promptly arrested with the help of members of the public. “On interrogation, the three suspects who claimed to have come from jigawa state could not give any reasonable account of why the child was seen with them or why they wanted to board commercial bus with the child.” The child has however been reunited with his parents while the suspects are undergoing interrogation. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, CP Kenneth Ebrimson has ordered the immediate transfer of the suspects to state criminal investigation and intelligence department for discreet investigation and possible prosecution. The CP therefore advised parents to always take the security and wellbeing of their children seriously in order to shield them from those looking for every means to be rich.

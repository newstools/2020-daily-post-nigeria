The 2019 governorship candidate of the All Progressive Grand Alliance(APGA) in Abia state, Dr. Alex Otti, has called on the people of the state to show the required disapproval to all government actions that seek to impoverish them as well as retard development of Abia. Otti, in a press release made available to newsmen on Wednesday afternoon in Umuahia by his Media Assistant, Ferdinand Ekeoma, to mark 2020 New Year celebration, again expressed sadness over the dwindling economic fortunes of majority of Abians, especially Civil Servants and Pensioners who are allegedly being tortured by the present Abia state government, which has refused to pay several months of their legitimate salaries, allowances and pensions. The APGA chieftain described 2020 as one that has great things in store for progressive Abians, and predicted a phenomenal dawn for Abians who have faith in God. Otti reminded all Abians, especially the well informed and economically well-off that as a state that goes by the sobriquet “God’s Own State” it would be a ridiculous irony to keep silent in the face of the ungodly and unpardonable misgovernance that is making mockery of Abia in the comity of states of the federation”. He felicitated with the good people of Abia state as they marked the 2020 New Year Celebration. Otti, an ex-Grouping Managing Director(GMD) of defunct Diamond Bank Plc, however, expressed gratitude to God for protecting the people of the state thus far, and for granting journey mercies to those who traveled far and near for the Christmas and New Year celebrations.

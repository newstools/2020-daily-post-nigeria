The All Progressives Congress in the state had on Friday announced withdrawal from the Re-run polls, citing alleged bias of the Independent National Electoral Commission as reason for the withdrawal. The chairman of the party, Ini Okopido, had said that the party was no longer comfortable to go into any election supervised by Mike Igini, because of his alleged hatred for the party. “We have officially as a party withdrawn from the Re-run election in Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. We’re so dissatisfied with the conduct of INEC in the state. “As far as we are concerned, Igini, has shown unprecedented bias against APC. We know he does not like us and if he conducts any election in the state we will not participate” Okopido had said. Speaking while reacting to the purported withdrawal, a PDP Chieftain and Commissioner of Trade and Investment, Prince Akpabio,. described the withdrawal as “political gimmick” to deceive the PDP. He said, “The withdrawal was a gimmick to deceive the PDP, but we are conscious of their antics.”

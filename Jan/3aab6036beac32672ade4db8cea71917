Real Madrid, Florentino Perez, has joked that he has never even heard of Paul Pogba, when asked about their interest in the Manchester United midfielder. Pogba, 26, has long been linked with a move to Madrid. The France international has also made no secret of his desire to play under his compatriot Zinedine Zidane at the Santiago Bernabeu. Zidane himself has talked up the move several times. It is understood senior players and officials at United are now resigned to losing Pogba, despite Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s insistence that the midfielder remains a key part of his plans. Amid the speculation, Madrid president, Perez feigned ignorance when he was asked about the club’s chances of wrapping up a deal. “I don’t know who Pogba is?” Perez replied with a smile following Madrid’s Spanish Super Cup triumph over Atletico Madrid in Saudi Arabia.

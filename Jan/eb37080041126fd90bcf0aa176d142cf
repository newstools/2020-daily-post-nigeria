Properties belonging to the students and the management of Loretto Special Science School, Adazi Nnukwu in Anaocha L.G.A of Anambra State, which were yet to be quantified monetarily, were on Friday night damaged by fire. DAILY POST gathered that the fire began at about 7:30pm in one of the dormitories housing students in the school’s Red House. It was learnt that despite a short delay in arriving the scene by men of the Anambra State Fire Service, the fire was, however, put off at about 9pm, preventing it from escalating into other parts of the school. The state Police Command’s spokesman, SP Haruna Mohammed confirmed the incident, but stated that no life was lost in the inferno. He said, “On 17/01/ 2020 at about 7:30pm, there was fire incident at Loretto Special School of Science Adazi Nnukwu in Anaocha L.G.A of Anambra State. “The Fire incident occurred upstairs of RED HOUSE Hostel/Dormitory within the premises of the school compoud. As a result, many properties were damaged by the inferno. “Following the distress call,Police patrol team led by DPO Neni Division SP Asadu Uchechukwu rushed to the scene and alerted Fire Service department who equally responded and put off the fire.” The cause of the fire was not immediately ascertained as of press time. But Mohammed said the state police commissioner, John Abang had ordered an investigation into the cause of the fire. In Onitsha a week ago, another school, Patterson College also had its dormitory gutted by fire. But unlike Loretto, one student who did not join others to the devotion, but stayed back in the dormitory was burnt to death.

Former Premier League champions, Chelsea have been told that they will have to pay close to £25million for striker, Edison Cavani in this January transfer window, according to the Manchester Evening News. DAILY POST had reported that Cavani has drawn interest from Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Atletico Madrid in recent weeks. The Uruguay international has started just four games in Ligue 1 this season for PSG, having lost his place to Mauro Icardi who is on loan from Inter Milan. His current contract with the Parisians is set to expire at the end of the season, when he will be available on a free transfer. Chelsea technical mentor, Claude Makelele has reportedly held initial talks with the French Ligue 1 champions in France over a possible transfer for the former Napoli star. Speaking on Cavani’s future, PSG manager, Thomas Tuchel said recently: “It has been difficult for Edinson after picking up an injury. “If there can be departures and arrivals in the group? It’s still possible in football, I can’t say. “Cavani? We have to ask Edi the question. He is injured right now. He felt something in training and he couldn’t be there [against Monaco]. “If I want him to stay? It’s better, to achieve our goals, to have him, yes.”

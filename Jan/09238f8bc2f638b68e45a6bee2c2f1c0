Nigeria’s former Minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has reacted to Iran’s admission that it shot down the airline that killed over 170 passengers on Wednesday. Iran’s admission was contained in a statement on Saturday morning where it also blamed “human error” for the incident, adding that the military mistook Flight 752 for a “hostile target.” Recall that the jetliner, a Boeing 737 operated by Ukrainian International Airlines, went down on the outskirts of Tehran during takeoff just hours after Iran launched a barrage of missiles at US forces in Iraq. Writing on his verified Twitter page, Fani-Kayode described the incident as God’s judgement. He said, “Finally the beasts have confessed. I ask again, where are the low-lives on @Twitter that insulted me when I said the Iranians shot down the plane moments after it came down? Listen to the voice of the voiceless & learn! “50 people died in a stampede during your hero’s burial. You shot down a passenger jet “by mistake” killing 170 innocent people & earned the hatred of the civilised world. “Two earthquakes took place in your nation with loss of life. All in 24 hours! Is this not God’s judgement.”

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said he is looking to bring in attackers, following their 1-0 defeat to Newcastle on Saturday. The Blues wasted the chance to go clear in fourth place, as they lost thanks to Isaac Hayden’s late goal. Chelsea could end the weekend nine points behind Leicester in third, if the Foxes beat Burnley on Sunday. It was another frustrating afternoon for Lampard’s men, who had 70 percent of the ball and 19 attempts, but could not score. Speaking to reporters after the game, Lampard insisted he needs reinforcements this month, amid links to strikers Timo Werner and Moussa Dembele. “If we are looking for people to bring in to the areas to win games when you are controlling it, it is scoring goals. “We can’t work anymore in training on finishing. You need to have that killer instinct in front of goal. “We need to score more goals from front-line areas if we are going to get to where we want to be. “It’s quite clear from what I am saying now that we know where we need to strengthen but we shall see. “We know we have problems at the top of the pitch in terms of we don’t get enough goals. “If you don’t score you are always liable for a sucker punch and they got it,” he said.

The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Wednesday, said the failure of President Muhammadu Buhari-led Fedeal Government to prosecute the war against Boko Haram was responsible for the abduction and execution of Lawan Andimi. Andimi, who was the Chairman of the Christain Association of Nigeria, CAN, in Adamawa State, was beheaded by Boko Haram on Monday. However, PDP said the killing of Andimi has exposed Buhari-led government as incompetent. In a statement by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan said: “The failure of the Federal Government to prosecute the war against acts of terrorism beyond lip service and condolence statements is emboldening killings, which have now degenerated to execution of compatriots, the latest being the gruesome beheading of the Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), in Adamawa, Rev. Lawan Andimi. “The execution of Rev. Andimi is heartrending and like other killings, remains a sad commentary of the inability of a government to stand for its citizens at very crucial moments. “We recall that the Buhari-led Federal Government had failed to prosecute the masterminds of the mass killings in Benue, Nasarawa, Bauchi, Taraba, Kogi, Adamawa, Borno, Yobe, Zamfara, Kaduna, Ekiti and
other parts of the country under the current administration. “Moreover, the body language, brazen acts of nepotism as well as divisive and incendiary comments by officials in the Buhari administration have continued to fuel disunity, acts of violence and insecurity in various parts of our nation.”

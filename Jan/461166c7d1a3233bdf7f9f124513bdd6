Manchester United legend, Ryan Giggs has insisted that midfielder, Paul Pogba has been so inconsistent for the club so far this season. The Wales manager also urged Man United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to sign Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish and Leicester City’s James Maddison. According to Giggs, both Grealish and Maddison could unlock the door for Solskjaer’s side to succeed this season. “I don’t think he’s [Solskjaer] got the players,” Giggs told beIN Sports. “He’s probably a couple of players short in actually changing that way of playing. You know, that No.10, that focal point, and also a midfielder. “Whether Pogba is that, he’s been so inconsistent, obviously on his day he could be that player. But, they are missing a Grealish, Maddison and a player like that really that could unlock the door. “Because of the pace that we’ve got it suits the way that they play and also when you come up against good teams they like to dominate possession.” Man United will face Burnley on Wednesday night in the Premier League fixture at Old Trafford following a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool over the weekend.

Super agent, Jorge Mendes, has confirmed Manchester United transfer target Bruno Fernandes will leave Sporting Lisbon, but not necessarily this month. United have trying to land the midfielder this January, but have failed to agree on a transfer fee. Fernandes is reportedly desperate to leave the Portuguese club now, but he might not get a move this month. Mendes even claimed United may not be his destination. “If he doesn’t leave now, he will leave for sure in the summer because Sporting have already spoken with other clubs. “Something will happen but I am not sure if now or at the end of the season,” Mendes said according to the UK Mirror.

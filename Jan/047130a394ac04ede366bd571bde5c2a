A chieftain of Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari is opposed to the Southwest security outfit, Amotekun. Adebanjo claimed that Buhari wanted to rule Nigeria by force, hence, his alleged opposition to Amotekun. Featuring on Arise Television’s Morning Show, Adebanjo said the solution to the security challenge in the country was state police. He said: “That is why Buhari is opposed to it because he wants to rule the country by force. “So, those of you who are honest you need to bring Buhari to restructure this country and send us back to federalism; let everybody develop at his own pace. “That is the constitution Sarduana, Awolowo and Azikiwe agreed to at Independence.” This is coming at a time when the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami on Tuesday declared the Southwest security outfit code named Amotekun illegal. In a statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media and Public Relations, Dr Umar Gwandu, Malami had said the establishment of Amotekun was not backed by any known law in the land. “The setting up of the paramilitary organization called “Amotekun” is illegal and runs contrary to the provisions of the Nigerian law,” Malami had said.

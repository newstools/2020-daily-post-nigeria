Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, is looking to bring in a goalkeeper and a striker before the close of the January transfer window, the UK Express reports. The Blues have been linked with Lyon’s Moussa Dembele and Lille star Boubakary Soumare, but have completed just one signing this month – an £860,000 deal for 16-year-old Bryan Fiabema. However, it is believed Lampard is planning to get two deals over the line. The Chelsea boss is targeting a goalkeeper to challenge Kepa Arrizabalaga and a forward to strengthen his attacking options. An injury to Tammy Abraham has intensified the need for another striker, while there are still doubts over Arrizabalaga. The Spaniard came under fire for his performance against Arsenal and was blamed for Hector Bellerin’s late equaliser. Burnley’s Nick Pope has been touted as a possible option for Lampard.

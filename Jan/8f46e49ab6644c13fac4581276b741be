Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, netted a hat-trick as they beat Cagliari 4-0 in a Serie A fixture on Monday. His second-half treble means he becomes just the second player to score hat-tricks in Serie A, LaLiga and the Premier League. The first player to achieve this feat is Alexis Sanchez. Sanchez achieved this feat, when Arsenal beat Leicester 5-2 in September 2015, having previously hit trebles for Barcelona and Udinese. Ronaldo hit league hat-tricks for Manchester United and Real Madrid before today. It was the Portugal forwardâ€™s 36th league hat-trick of his career. Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has 34.

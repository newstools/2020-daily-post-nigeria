The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), on Tuesday dismissed suggestions that President Muhammadu Buhari has directed the stoppage of salaries of university lecturers yet to enrol into the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). Its President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi, in a statement in Abuja, said that rumours to that effect being circulated in the social media were fake. He added that ASUU was committed to its tradition of consultation and dialogue which informed the engagement with Buhari last week. The statement read: “To put the records straight, at no point during the meeting did President Buhari put a closure to the ongoing discussion on ASUU’s preference for the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS). “He also did not direct that salaries of ASUU members be stopped for failure to enroll in the IPPIS. “Any report to the contrary is circulated to mislead the public “We had useful discussions with the President and we are hopeful that our prayers will receive the expected prompt attention.”

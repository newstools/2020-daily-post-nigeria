An internet fraudster, Agwu Goodness, Tuesday, bagged six months jail over alleged roles in offences bordering on internet fraud and other fraud related matters. Justice Sikiru Oyinloye convicted and sentenced Goodness to six months imprisonment after pleading guilty to a one count charge levelled against him by the Ilorin Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The charge against the accused read; “That you, Agwu Goodness (a.k.a Shemmy Barnes) sometime in October 2019 or thereabout at Ilorin, Kwara state within the jurisdiction of this honorable court attempted to commit an offence of cheating by pretending to be one Shemmy Barnes, a white woman,who is purportedly in love with one Theo,as it is contained in your gmail account: shemmybarnes o@gmail.com and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 95 and 321 of the Penal code law and punishable under the Section 322 of the same law.” Counsel to the EFCC, A .A Adebayo, however, called on one Lamidi Olarewaju, an operative of the anti -graft agency to review the facts of the case.

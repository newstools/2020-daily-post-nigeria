Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani has visited Iran amid rising tension between Iran and the US. The visit followed the killing of an Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani in a drone airstrike, Anadolu Agency reports, according to Middle East Monitor. This was contained in a statement by the Qatari Royal Court, which revealed that Tamim will “hold talks with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and senior officials on bilateral relations and regional developments.” The Qatari leader will also meet with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to discuss regional developments. Tension soared in the region after the US killed Qasem Soleimani, a top Iranian general, in a drone airstrike outside Baghdad airport earlier this month. Iran retaliated with firing a dozen ballistic missiles at Iraqi bases housing US troops. Last week, Qatari Foreign Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani visited Tehran for talks aimed at easing tension in the region following Soleimani’s killing.

The Chancellor of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Alfred Achebe has waded into the crisis over the selection of a new Vice Chancellor of the institution. The Chancellor in a letter to the federal ministry of education and National Universities Commission, NUC, urged them to take urgent steps towards resolving the impasse. He explained in a letter to the Executive Secretary, NUC, Prof Abubakar Rasheed, that the impasse was already common knowledge and could seriously dislocate the peaceful working of the institution. The Chancellor noted that with the interview of candidates already scheduled for January 21 and 23 and a Governing Council meeting for January 23 for a final decision, there is the need to act immediately. The letter reads, “If the Hon. Minister is satisfied that the Governing Council is unable as a body to peacefully and harmoniously complete this important assignment in the life of any university, it would be very prudent to urgently set up an independent body under the ministry/NUC to complete the selection of the new Vice Chancellor.” In the same vein, the management of the university has suspended the selection of a new Vice Chancellor due to what it described as “tension and security risk to the university arising from widespread allegations of breach of due process”. A letter to the Registrar of the institution, Mallam Abdullahi Ahmed Kundila by the Vice Chancellor, Prof Ibrahim Garba, directed the suspension of the interview process.

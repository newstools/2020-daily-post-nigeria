The New Year prophecy of Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka of the Adoration Ministries, Enugu State has come to pass. DAILY POST reported that Mbaka had prophesied that the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Imo State, during the last election will emerge governor of the state. Mbaka predicted that the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Hope Uzodinma, will take over from Emeka Ihedioha as Imo Governor in 2020. His prophecy came to pass as the Supreme Court on Tuesday sacked Gov Ihedioha and declared APCâ€™s Hope Uzodinma as the Governor of Imo State. It, therefore, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to withdraw the certificate of return from former Governor Emeka Ihedioha and issue Uzodinma with certificate of return as governor of the state. Delivering the judgment, Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun said the votes due to Uzodinma and APC from 318 polling units were wrongly excluded and should be added.

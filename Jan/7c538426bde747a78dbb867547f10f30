Iran has reacted after a Ukrainian airplane carrying at least 180 people crashed Wednesday near an airport in the capital, Tehran. The crash occurred hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile, targeting two bases in Iraq housing U.S. forces in retaliation for the killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani. There was no immediate word on casualties, according to Iranian State TV, adding that the crash is suspected to have been caused by mechanical issues. The plane had taken off from Imam Khomeini International Airport. Iranian Civil Aviation Spokesperson, Reza Jafarzadeh, said an investigation team was at the site of the crash in southwestern outskirts of Tehran. “After taking off from Imam Khomeini international airport, it crashed between Parand and Shahriar,’’ Jafarzadeh said. “An investigation team from the national aviation department was dispatched to the location after the news was announced.” Flight data from the airport showed a Ukrainian 737-800 flown by Ukraine International Airlines took off Wednesday morning, then stopped sending data almost immediately afterward, according to website FlightRadar24.

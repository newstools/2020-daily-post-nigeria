Senate President, Ahmad Lawan says Nigerian doctors must work hard. He gave the charge while noting that it was very necessary for Nigeria to pay special attention to the health sector to minimise health challenges confronting the nation. Lawan spoke at the National Executive Council meeting of the Nigerian Association of Resident Doctors (NARD), on Thursday in Abuja. NAN reports that Lawan was represented by the Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Dr Ibrahim Oloriegbe. “The call has become important because of the numerous health challenges facing the world at the moment. So many diseases and so many viruses, known and unknown, are ravaging the people. “Nigerian doctors must work hard so as to become great example for their colleagues the world over,” he said. He commended NARD for being consistent in holding its NEC meeting whose major focus is usually the improvement of the health sector.
Lawal assured the health practitioners of the required collaboration toward the immediate implementation of the Health Act, urging them to hold tight to the professional ethics in the discharge of their duties. Last July, NARD threatened to strike over three grievances – salary arrears, skipped salary of N23.6bn and irregularities in the implementation of the Resident Doctors’ Act.

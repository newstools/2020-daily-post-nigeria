European Union (EU) member states gave their final formal go-ahead for Britain’s imminent departure from the bloc on Thursday. Dpa reports that Britain’s 47 years of EU membership are formally due to cease at midnight on Friday (2300 GMT). UK will be the first country to leave the bloc. “The European Union’s remaining 27 countries approved Britain’s withdrawal agreement by written procedure,’’ the European Council announced. “From that time on, the UK will no longer be an EU member state and will be considered as a third country”. On Wednesday, the European Parliament approved the deal. The withdrawal agreement ensures a smooth Brexit by initially keeping EU laws in place for Britain and buying time to replace these with new regulations. It includes key provisions on citizens’ rights, arrangements to maintain peace on the divided island of Ireland and Britain’s remaining financial obligations.

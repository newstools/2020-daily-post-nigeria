Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has reacted to his side’s Premier League 2-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday. Two goals from Virgil van Dijk and Mohamed Salah gave Klopp’s men all three points against the Red Devils at Anfield. Speaking after the game, Klopp was quoted by Liverpool’s official website as saying at his post-match: “Good game, really good game. One of the best derbies we played for sure so far. Very dominant in most periods of the game. “I didn’t like too much in the first half of the last five or seven minutes but nothing happened really, just we were not as dominant as before. We played outstandingly well, we dominated the opponent, we played exactly in the space we had to. “When we saw the line-up it was pretty clear what they wanted to do. The boys used the spaces really well, so dropping a six, being there, high full-backs, being flexible and creating a lot of chances. “We scored from the set-piece but had other situations obviously. And then the start of the second half was absolutely brutal – wow. We jumped in and had, I don’t know, three, four chances at least and didn’t score. How it always is and how it often enough was now in that season, the opponent has the chance to come back. That’s what happened.”

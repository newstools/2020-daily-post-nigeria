Former Chelsea star, Alan Hudson has urged the club to sign Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish as forward, Eden Hazard’s replacement at Stamford Bridge. Hazard left Chelsea for Real Madrid on June 13, 2019 after winning the Europa League trophy with the Bleus. Chelsea are yet to get a perfect replacement for the Belgium international. But Hudson now believes that Frank Lampard’s side should make Grealish their top transfer priority, adding that the 24-year-old is the ideal replacement for Hazard. “I am his biggest fan,” Hudson told CaughtOffside. “Grealish is the most outstanding attacking midfield player in the game at this moment. “A player who goes past people and scores goals. “The bottom line is Chelsea haven’t got anyone since (Eden) Hazard left who has the fans on the edge of their seats. Jack Grealish would be that man.” Grealish has scored seven Premier League goals and registered five assists for Aston Villa so far this season.

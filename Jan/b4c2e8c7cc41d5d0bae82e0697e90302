Liverpool legend, Jamie Carragher, has predicted a shocking scoreline between Manchester United and Jurgen Klopp’s side when both teams clash in the Premier League. Liverpool will host Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men at Anfield on Sunday evening, Liverpool head to the game after beating Tottenham 1-0 in their last encounter, while Man United won Norwich City 4-0. But Carragher has now backed the Reds to beat the Red Devils 3-1. “I am confident Liverpool will win the game. Mourinho, in his first couple games at Anfield with United, made it really difficult for Liverpool,” Carragher told Sky Sports. “But in the last one Liverpool really dominated and came out on top in Mourinho’s final game at United. “I think Ole is not quite as pragmatic as Mourinho, so I don’t see it being a shut-out kind of game, and I think the tactic for United will be very similar to what it was against Manchester City in December, playing deep and trying to hit on the counter-attack. “They were absolutely devastating that day, and if they produce a similar sort of performance, Liverpool could have major problems. “But there is a gulf between the two clubs, and if Liverpool play anywhere near what they are capable of, they will come out on top. “I’m confident of a Liverpool win. I think 3-1 Liverpool. And if that is the score, we’ve got the pundit-camera on us in the commentary box, and hopefully we’ll see similar scenes to what we saw at Old Trafford when Adam Lallana got the equaliser!” The kick-off time for the match is 5:30pm.

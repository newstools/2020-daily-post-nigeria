The Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has warned civil servants across all ministries, departments and agencies in the state against engaging in partisan politics. Akeredolu who was speaking during the special prayers to mark the first working day in the new year said his administration will not tolerate civil servants wearing Campaign attires including that of his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC). The governor admonished the workers to leave politics for politicians. “I don’t want any civil servant to wear endorsement T-shirt for me. Civil servants should not be involved in politics. “I don’t want workers to do like they did before I came on board. They should focus on their jobs and let politicians play politics. “We are all political animals, but workers should stay away from politics. And if they want to do, it should be done moderately.” Meanwhile, Akeredolu also informed the civil servants of his administration readiness to pay the N30,000 minimum wage as soon as the ongoing negotiation between the Organised Labour and the State Government is concluded.

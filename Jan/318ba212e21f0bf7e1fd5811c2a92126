Monaco midfielder, Cesc Fabregas has hailed both Chelsea and Arsenal following both teams’ 2-2 draw in the Premier League on Tuesday night. Fabregas, a former Chelsea and Arsenal player, also gave special praise to the Gunners for playing with 10 men against Frank Lampard’s side during the encounter. Jorginho scored from the spot-kick after David Luiz was sent off for a challenge on Tammy Abraham. Martinelli took advantage of N’Golo Kante’s slip to equalise for Mikel Arteta’s men after half-time. Two goals from Cesar Azpilicueta and Hector Bellerin in the second half ensured both sides got a point each at Stamford Bridge. Reacting after the match, Fabregas took to his official Twitter page and wrote: “Love games like this. Both teams went all in. “Also very difficult to play that well and be that brave at the bridge with 10 men for the longest part of the game and being in behind twice. Well done @arsenal and @chelsea.”

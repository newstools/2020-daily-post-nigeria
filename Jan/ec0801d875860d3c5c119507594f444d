DAILY POST had reported that Jimenez, who scored in his side’s Premier League 2-1 defeat to Liverpool on Thursday night at Molineux, has drawn interest from Manchester United. Speaking on Jimenez, Cole told BT Sport on Thursday: “Wolves fans won’t thank me for saying it but if I’m Chelsea, Tottenham and Manchester United and you’ve got a checkbook ready to go, he’s the first name. “If you want someone to make an instant impact on your team, you want someone to tick boxes, who knows the league, knows the flow of English football. “It’s all well and good being part of a project but when Manchester United, Chelsea and Tottenham come for you, it may turn your head. “For me, he [Jimenez] could quite easily play for anyone of those teams because he’s got so much ability. He’s one of my favourite players to watch.”

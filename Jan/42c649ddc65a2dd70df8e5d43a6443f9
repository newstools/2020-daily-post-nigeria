The former Governor of Cross River State, Senator Liyel Imoke has urged politicians and winners of Abi/Yakurr re-run election in Cross River to sheath their swords and give peace a chance. Senator Imoke in a press statement issued by Mr Christian Ita, Chief Press Secretary to Governor Ben Ayade also urged citizens to condemn and abhor denigration of leaders “We must condemn and abhor the denigration and abuse of leaders and the perpetuation of divisive tendencies. Abi/Yakurr and indeed Cross River State, can only grow if we give our representatives the requisite support. “I also expect that Alex (Egbonna) and Davis (Etta) will provide qualitative representation for the Federal Constituency and the State Constituency, respectively. While acknowledging everyone’s constitutional right to seek redress, I advise that this matter not be pursued any further in the courts. For John Gaul and Iwara, I believe you did your best and I wish you well in your future endeavours.” The former governor also congratulated Dr. Alex Egbonna and Dr. Davis Etta for emerging winners of the re-run elections for Abi/Yakurr Federal Constituency and Abi State Constituency respectively. Egbonna is of the All Progressives Congress (APC) while Etta is of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Imoke said with the elections over, it was time for all to unite for the common good of the people of the federal constituency. While acknowledging that “through the course of this season, as is always the case, tensions were perceived to be high,” he was happy that “ultimately the elections were peaceful.” He commended both the politicians and electorate “for the maturity exhibited through this election season. Now that elections are over and I believe the better politicians won, we must all sheath our swords and unite for our common good.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said Paul Pogba is injured again and will be out for “a few weeks”. Pogba did not travel with the rest of the squad, for their New Year’s Day clash against Arsenal at the Emirates. The France midfielder made a return prior to Christmas against Watford. But he was missing again, when United saw off Burnley 2-0 in their last fixture. “Pogba? He’s injured, he’s feeling some discomfort in his ankle. He’ll be out for a few weeks, definitely,” Solskjaer told MUTV.

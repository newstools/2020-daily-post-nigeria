Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta has revealed that he will feature Gunners’ players who are ‘best fit’ against Sheffield United in Saturday’s Premier League clash at the Emirates Stadium. Arteta’s side head to the game following a 1-1 draw against Crystal Palace in their last encounter. “We have a lot of issues at the back, the fact that Calum got the big injury is modifying our plans,” Arteta was quoted by Arsenal’s official website as saying ahead of his side’s clash with Sheffield on Saturday. “It is what we have, the situation, it can happen between December and January, it is very common. “We have to live with it, this is what we have. “We have to put 11 players out on the pitch on Saturday [against Sheffield] and I am sure we will. “They will try their best, and I will try to select the ones who in my opinion are the best fit for that game. He added: “The solidarity in their team [Sheffield] is incredible, how hard they work for each other and they have very clear principles – in attack and in defence, restarts of play, set-pieces – with what they want to do. So it will be a very difficult test. I already warned the players today.” The kick-off time for the match is 4pm.

Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola has revealed that Manchester United will have ‘to do almost a perfect game’ against his side in Wednesday’s Carabao Cup semi-final second leg tie at Etihad in order to reach the final. Guardiola said this at his pre-match press conference on Tuesday. Guardiola’s men head to the game following a 3-1 victory over Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side in the first leg encounter. “It is Man United so they can do it, they have done it and they can do it,” Guardiola was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying. “They have to do almost a perfect game to go through from the semi-final. “These kind of games against these kind of teams, with this incredible history behind them, I know how difficult it will be to reach the final.” He added: “We have to be careful about their skills, the counter-attack, with how they can play if we let them play. “We have to defend well. They don’t have anything to lose. They will attack. We know the best result is not to defend, we have to score goals.”

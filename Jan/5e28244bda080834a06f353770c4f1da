President Donald Trump on Friday described the decision by Britain’s Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan to step back from royal duties as “sad.” “I don’t want to get into the whole thing. “I just have such respect for the Queen. I don’t think this should be happening to her,” Trump added in an interview with Fox News on Friday. This is coming after Markle and Prince Harry announced they will take “a step back” as senior members of the royal family. DAILY POST had reported that the couple announced their decision to step back from their royal position. The couple disclosed the news in a statement posted on their Instagram page on Wednesday. Harry and Meghan also said they now intend to pursue financial independence. The surprise announcement came after they had denounced intrusive and inaccurate media reporting, as well as the vitriol directed toward them on social media, including racist attacks against U.S.-born Meghan, whose mother is black.

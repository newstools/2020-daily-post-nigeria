Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has responded to speculations linking Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha with a move to Stamford Bridge this January’s transfer window. DAILY POST had reported that Zaha has been heavily linked with a move to Chelsea after the Blues successfully appealed their transfer ban from FIFA at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). When asked about Chelsea’s interest in the Ivory Coast international, Lampard claimed that the West London club will do its transfer work behind closed doors. “As I say I won’t talk about Zaha because he is not a player of ours,” Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying at his post-match press conference on Wednesday after his side’s Premier League 1-1 draw with Brighton that “If we have to do business we will do it in the way we see fit to try and make us better and that’s behind closed doors as opposed to just announcing who we might want to bring in.” Download Daily Post App.    Subscribe to Daily Post Newsletter.    Advertise with us.   Send us enquiries, press releases.

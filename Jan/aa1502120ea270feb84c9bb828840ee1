Mr Ibrahim Magu, the acting Chairman of Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), has alleged that some foreign countries were sabotaging the commission’s efforts at repatriating a former Minister of Petroleum, Diezani Allison-Madueke. He stated this on Wednesday during an official visit to the Ibadan zonal office of the commission. EFCC had in the last five years been on the trail of the former minister over alleged corrupt practices. Magu said that he suspected sabotage on the part of some foreign countries over Allison-Madueke’s case The EFCC boss wondered why the countries would keep her from the commission for no just reason. “They have not taken her to court and this is the fifth year. Why should you be investigating a case for five years? It is a straight case and not a murder case which takes longer processes. “You know it is a financial crime investigation. It is a straight forward case. If you don’t have sufficient evidences to take her to court, bring her back. We have more than enough evidences to take her to court. “I don’t know why they are protecting her. Release her and let her come back to Nigeria. They are giving her protection for reasons best known to them. “They have yet to declare any evidence recovered against her. They are still relying on our evidences,” he said. The anti-graft agency had sometime in November dismissed claims that it has dropped all corruption charges against Diezani Alison-Madueke.

President Muhammadu Buhari, Saturday, in London said that the partial closure of Nigeria’s borders was not to punish her neighbours. He explained that it was meant to strengthen the country’s security and economy. At a meeting with a select group of the Nigerian community in the United Kingdom, the President explained that the period of closure will be used for stock-taking on threats to the nation’s security and economy. He noted that Nigerian farmers have been celebrating the closure which has drastically reduced smuggling of agricultural produce as well as arms and ammunition. Buhari attributed the country’s virtual food security position to the “very good last three rainy seasons;” the federal government’s reduction in the price of fertilizers by 50 per cent and the presidential directive to the Central Bank of Nigeria not to give foreign exchange for food imports thereby saving the nations billions of naira. Commending Nigerians in the Diaspora for their huge home remittances – more than $25 billion in 2018 – the President also lauded their individual performances in their various fields of expertise. Explaining the achievements of his administration, the President said Nigeria’s “huge, vibrant youth population” have been encouraged to go back to the farms and are “living decent and respectable lifestyles.”

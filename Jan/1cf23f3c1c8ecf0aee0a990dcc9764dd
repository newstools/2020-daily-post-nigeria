Eddie Nketiah has confirmed that he will end his loan spell at Leeds United and return to Arsenal this month. The striker played in Leeds’ 1-1 draw with West Brom on New Year Day and waved to the visiting fans after he was substituted. “Unfortunately my time @LUFC has come to an end. It’s been an amazing experience and a privilege to play for such an amazing club. “I would like to say a big thank you to my teammates, the coaching staff and the manager for making my time here an enjoyable one. “Lastly, a big thank you to all the wonderful fans for taking to me so quickly. I wish the club all the best and I’m sure you’ll get to the promised land,” Nketiah tweeted. The 20-year-old scored four goals in his first six matches for Leeds in all competitions, before struggling for game time under Marcelo Bielsa.

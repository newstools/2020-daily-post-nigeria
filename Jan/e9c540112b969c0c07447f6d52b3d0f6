Arsenal striker, Gabriel Martinelli, has revealed what manager Mikel Arteta and defender David Luiz said, during half time of their 2-2 draw at Chelsea on Tuesday. The Gunners were a man down before the half-hour mark, after Luiz was sent off. Jorginho made it 1-0 from the penalty spot before Martinelli ran through to equalize. Arsenal captain, Hector Bellerin, equalised three minutes after opposing captain Cesar Azpilicueta thought he had claimed a victory for the Blues “Mikel Arteta told us to keep playing and we played for David. I spoke with him [Luiz] at half-time and he asked me to score a goal for him,” Martinelli told ESPN Brazil. “The team is focused and united. Everyone in the team gives me so much confidence. “Mikel tells me to run at them, so I got the ball and did what he asked.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has insisted that the Red Devils are still the ‘biggest club’ in the world. According to Solskjaer, Man United always come back strong when they are not on form, adding that it is always in their ‘heads’. Solskjaer said this on Monday ahead of his side’s Carabao Cup semi-final first leg clash against Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City on Tuesday night at Old Trafford. Solskjaer’s side head to the game following a 2-0 defeat to Arsenal in the Premier League in their last encounter. “It is a different time. When the owners came in at City you knew they were going to go for it,” Solskjaer said at his pre-match press conference as quoted by the UK Independent. “I’m never surprised by anything in football and with what they have done they deserve to be where they are. “We are still in our own heads the biggest club in the world so of course we want to get back to where we were. It’s going to take time. “You have to go for it at this club, that’s what we are here for, to take on the challenges that are given to us. “We are Man United. We have been up and we’ve been down but we’ve always come back.”

Leicester City boss, Brendan Rodgers has described Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi as a phenomenal player. He also said that not many players do the job the Nigerian does in the defensive midfield. Rodgers spoke at his press conference on Tuesday ahead Leicester City’s midweek clash with West Ham United. The Foxes have been unable to win all three matches they played in the absence of Ndidi who is recovering from injury. “He’s a real colossal player for us. He allows to defend and to defend forward. “He covers a lot of space for our attacking players and there’s not too many players better than him who do that job. “He’s a phenomenal player. To have him back early is a huge boost for us. He has been a miss, no doubt.”

Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have abducted a 70-year-old grandmother in Ondo State. The victim identified as Mrs Fehintola Wewe was said to have been forcefully taken from her home situated at 13, Broad Street, Sabomi in Ese-Odo Local Government Area of Ondo State. Her abduction is coming three weeks after some gunmen kidnapped wife, children, and driver of a traditional ruler in the state, Oba Rufus Akinrinmade. For Mrs Wewe, her abductors took her away at about 11 pm during the weekend when the suspected kidnappers invaded her residence at the riverine community. The gunmen were said to have also left with valuables as they raided the area. A source close to the family said the case had been reported at Igbekebo Divisional Police Station. Meanwhile, the abductors are yet to contact the family of the aged septuagenarian.

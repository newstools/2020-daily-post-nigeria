Manchester United may consider sacking manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, if results do not improve at the Old Trafford this season, the Daily Mail reports. England boss, Gareth Southgate, has now emerged as a leading contender to take over after Euro 2020. United are keen for Solskjaer to turn things around, but the 46-year-old privately acknowledges he will not be given three years to win a trophy like Jurgen Klopp was at Liverpool. The fans chanted against the owners after losing to Burnley at Old Trafford last Wednesday and left before the full-time whistle. United face an FA Cup fourth-round tie at Tranmere on Sunday, then meet Manchester City in the Carabao Cup semi-final on Wednesday trailing 3-1 from the first leg.

Manchester United are close to sealing a deal for Bruno Fernandes, after they agreed a £68m fee with Sporting Lisbon, Sky Sports reports. After weeks of negotiations, United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has reached an agreement with Sporting’s director Hugo Viana. United will pay an initial fee of 55m euros (£46.56m) plus add-ons for Fernandes, with the deal eventually rising to 80m euros (£67.76m). Sporting would receive a further 10m euros (£8.46m) from the Red Devils, if Fernandes reaches what are considered easily achievable targets and an additional 15m euros (£12.7m) if more difficult targets are met. It is understood these clauses include Fernandes winning the Ballon d’Or. Officials in Lisbon are waiting for documentation to be complete, before the transfer is signed off. Fernandes’ medical in Manchester could happen on Wednesday, depending on how quickly the paperwork can be signed off.

The Islamic Republic of Iran has warned the United Kingdom, France and Germany about “the consequences” of their decision to launch a dispute mechanism against it under the 2015 nuclear deal. The three countries had announced earlier on Tuesday that they triggered the dispute mechanism provided for in the landmark nuclear agreement in order to force Tehran to honour its commitments under the accord. “Of course, if the Europeans … seek to abuse [this process] they must also be prepared to accept the consequences,” Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement. Iran had suggested it had little faith in the declaration by France Germany and Britain that they were determined “to work with all participants to preserve” the historic deal. “On the contrary, it once again signals to everyone – in particular to the three European state parties to the agreement – that it will respond seriously and firmly to any disloyalty, ill will, or unconstructive action,” the statement added, according to Al Jazeera. The US had unilaterally pulled out of the multilateral nuclear deal in May 2018 and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran.

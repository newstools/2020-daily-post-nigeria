Russia has condemned US airstrikes that killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force. The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Iran-backed militia, Popular Mobilization Forces, which recently stormed the US embassy in Baghdad. Russia called the attack a “reckless step” that risked “regional peace and stability” in the Middle East. “Such actions do not create, find solutions to complex problems in the Middle East. On the contrary, it will lead to a new round of escalation of tensions in the region,” said Russia’s Foreign Ministry in a statement. In a separate statement, the ministry noted that Soleimani had “faithfully served and defended the national interests of Iran” and expressed condolences to the Iranian people over the commander’s death. Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the attack with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron by phone, with both sides agreeing “this action might seriously escalate tensions in the region.” US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, has explained why President Trump ordered the take out of Soleimani. Pompeo said the action was to disrupt an “imminent attack” that could have cost American lives in the Middle East region.

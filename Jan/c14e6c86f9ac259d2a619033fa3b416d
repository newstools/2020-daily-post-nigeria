Manchester United on Friday completed the signing of Southend United goalkeeper, Nathan Bishop on transfer deadline day. This is coming after the club had signed Bruno Fernandes on Wednesday from Sporting Lisbon. Speaking after joining the Red Devils, Bishop told Man United’s official website: “The opportunity to join Manchester United is a dream come true. “This club has a great record of developing goalkeepers and I cannot wait to work with the coaches here to improve every single day. “I want to take the chance to thank everyone at Southend United for everything they have done for me throughout my time there; without their support, this move would not have been possible.” Bishop, 20, made his first-team debut for the Shrimpers in December 2017. The England Under-20 international has since made 39 appearances for the League One club.

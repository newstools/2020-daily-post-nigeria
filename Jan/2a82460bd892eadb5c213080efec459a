Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers, has insisted James Maddison will not move to Manchester United. Rodgers, speaking to the media on Friday, said the player will not be affected by the interest from the Red Devils. Maddison, 23, has been a revelation at the King Power Stadium, since making a £22.5million switch from Norwich in June 2018. This season he has made his senior England debut and scored six goals and had three assists in the Premier League. “It is difficult every time we have a press conference to come up with various ways to say: ‘no, he is not for sale’. “James is very much a big part of our plan here. Having worked with him for a period of time and seen lots of rumours and gossip around his potential transfer from here, the boy is so focused on his game and his improvement. “I think his performances will tell you that. It doesn’t affect him in any way. Of course it is flattering for any player that people deem you are playing well enough. “But he is a kid who is very focused on improving his game and in training everyday he works very hard and takes that into the game. I have no concern whatsoever,” Rodgers said.

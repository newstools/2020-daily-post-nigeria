Premier League clubs, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur are reportedly battling to sign defender, Kalidou Koulibaly from Napoli. According to Italian newspaper, Corriere Della Sera, the Blues and Spurs are both targeting a huge deal for the 28-year-old Senegal international and have made contacts with the player’s representatives over a £100million deal. The report claimed the both Premier League clubs’ managers, Jose Mourinho and Frank Lampard are keen to bolster their squads in this January’s transfer window. Speaking on a potential move to other clubs, Koulibaly told Rai Sport last year: “My future? I don’t. I don’t know if I’m one of the strongest defenders. I always try to give my best. “Since I’m here, I always try to grow with Napoli. I have a lot of motivation to go on and I want to keep doing this. “I am pleased that many teams follow me, but I want to demonstrate on the field that I am at the level of the greatest and I want to show it in the future.”

Reece James has committed his long term future to Chelsea, after signing a new five-and-a-half year deal worth up to £25m. James has been rewarded for a breakthrough season with an improved contract that runs until 2025. The fullback will now earn a basic of £80,000-per-week. With bonuses his weekly wage will rise to around £100,000-a-week. James spent last season on loan at Wigan, but has forced his way into Frank Lampard’s first team this term. The 20-year-old has made 18 appearances this term and scored in Chelsea’s 7-1 Carabao Cup hammering of Grimsby. James has followed in the footsteps of fellow academy graduates Callum Hudson-Odoi, Mason Mount, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Fikayo Tomori and Billy Gilmour, who have also committed their futures to Chelsea since Lampard’s appointment.

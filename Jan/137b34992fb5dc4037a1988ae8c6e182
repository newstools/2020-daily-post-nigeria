Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand has criticised captain, Harry Maguire for his lack of leadership qualities during the Red Devils’ 2-0 defeat to Burnley in the Premier League on Wednesday night. Two goals from Chris Wood and Jay Rodriguez handed the visitors their first win at Old Trafford since 1962. United slumped to their second defeat in the space of three days, as their chances of making it to the UEFA Champions League next season also becomes slimmer. Maguire’s performance left Ferdinand furious as he slammed the England centre-back, who replaced Ashley Young as club captain last week, for lacking commanding ability when it really mattered during the encounter. “Go up and win it,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “Show the desire to win the ball. Someone has to go in there and be commanding. Maguire, you’re the captain. “The first ball isn’t really the problem. It’s the second ball. What are you doing there, Maguire? “He’s in a great position but what happens? He doesn’t anticipate it. You can’t be that far off. “He gets in front of him and gets punished. Just get against people, rough people up. You’ve got to make it difficult for people. That’s too easy.”

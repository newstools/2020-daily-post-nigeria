Festus Keyamo, Minister of State for Labour and Employment, has reacted to Governor Emeka Ihedioha’s defeat at the Supreme Court. DAILY POST had reported that the Supreme Court on Tuesday sacked Gov Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and declared the All Progressive Congress, APC’s Hope Uzodinma as the Governor of Imo State. It, therefore, ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to withdraw the certificate of return from former Governor Emeka Ihedioha and issue Uzodinma with certificate of return as governor of the state. Delivering the judgment, Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun said the votes due to Uzodinma and APC from 318 polling units were wrongly excluded and should be added. Reacting, Keyamo on his Twitter page commended the court’s Judgement. He said, “the same revered & exalted S/Court of Nigeria that nullified APC’s victory in Zamfara State has affirmed the victory of APC in Imo State. “That is judicial neutrality at its VERY BEST. I quickly dropped this here before our usual bad losers begin to cry foul & change the narrative.”

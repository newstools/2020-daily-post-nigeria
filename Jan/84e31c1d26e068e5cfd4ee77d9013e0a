Former Liverpool player, Jamie Carragher has predicted a win for the club in their Premier League clash with Manchester United on Sunday. Liverpool is currently 27 points ahead of United going into the game and Carragher predicted a scoreline of 3-1 in favour of his former club. United are the one team that have stopped Liverpool from this season, having drawn 1-1 with them at Old Trafford in October. “I am confident Liverpool will win the game,” Carragher predicted for Sky Sports. “Jose Mourinho, in his first couple games at Anfield with United, made it really difficult for Liverpool, but in the last one Liverpool really dominated and came out on top in Mourinho’s final game at United. “I think Ole is not quite as pragmatic as Mourinho, so I don’t see it being a shut-out kind of game, and I think the tactic for United will be very similar to what it was against Manchester City in December, playing deep and trying to hit on the counter-attack. “They were absolutely devastating that day, and if they produce a similar sort of performance, Liverpool could have major problems. “But there is a gulf between the two clubs, and if Liverpool play anywhere near what they are capable of, they will come out on top. “I’m confident of a Liverpool win. I think 3-1 Liverpool. And if that is the score, we’ve got the pundit-camera on us in the commentary box, and hopefully we’ll see similar scenes to what we saw at Old Trafford when Adam Lallana got the equaliser!”

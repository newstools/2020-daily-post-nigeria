The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, on Thursday, threw its weight behind the establishment of Amotekun by Southwest governors. Arewa Youths President General, Yerima Shettima, in an exclusive interview with DAILY POST said Amotekun was a noble idea that would complement the efforts of the Federal Government in the fight against insecurity. DAILY POST had reported that governors from Oyo, Ogun, Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, and Lagos States had a few weeks ago in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital launched the security outfit. The governors had explained that Amotekun was established to curb the issues of insecurity in the Southwest. But the Federal Government, through the office of the Attorney-General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, declared the security outfit illegal. However, Shettima insisted that the Federal Government and the South-West states should sit and address their differences with regards to Amotekun. Shettima called on the states to enact laws that would aide the operation of Amotekun in the South- West. He said: ” I’m obviously in support of Amotekun. I have come to understand that over time, there are issues between the federal government and states over the issue of Amotekun but I also know that they can always sit and amend it. “Moreover, I also do not subscribe to the notion that the Amotekun idea was to confront the federal government or do something different from what the government is doing but its to complement the effort of the Nigeria Police Force. Don’t forget that they are faced with a lot of security challenges in recent time. “Even in the context of international law, it’s allowed, so rather than castigate, we should see how to put it right. Enact laws within the state level so at the end of the day, the dos and don’ts will be spelt out for the group and such must be encouraged. Hopefully, we can overcome our security challenges now.”

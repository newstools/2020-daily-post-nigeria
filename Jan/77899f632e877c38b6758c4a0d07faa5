Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has admitted that midfielder, Christian Pulisic was missed by the Blues following their 2-2 draw with Arsenal in the Premier League on Tuesday night. According to Lampard, the 21-year-old USA international could have made the difference if he was fit to feature against Mikel Arteta’s side. Pulisic did not play against the Gunners after he picked up a “nasty” thigh injury in training some days ago, as goals from Jorginho, Gabriel Martinelli, Cesar Azpilicueta and Hector Bellerin ensured both sides got a point each at Stamford Bridge. “Yes, he [Christian Pulisic] was playing well and in terms of when he is back it is probably not going to be a week,” Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying after the match. “It will probably be the other end of the February break but he is getting better and he is not that far away. “A game like today [Chelsea vs Arsenal] could have been a game where he would be helpful for us because he was playing well for a patch but other people do need to stand up in those situations.” Pulisic has scored six goals and registered six assists in all competitions for Chelsea since joining the club from Dortmund last year

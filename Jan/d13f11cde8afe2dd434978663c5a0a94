The Operatives of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Command in Lagos, has apprehended another 9 girls being trafficked. A statement by the Service Public Relations Officer, DCI Sunday James on Saturday said the girls were on their way to Lebanon, Cairo, Dubai, and India on Ethiopian, Peace, Egypt and East Airlines. According to him, four of the girls claimed to be traveling for employment without knowing their employers nor aware of the nature of job they were going for. “This discovery was made after intensive interrogation by NIS officials,” he said. James further stated that the shady journey was organised by agents who took advantage of the girls’ innocence and ignorance adding that two of the girls had earlier claimed to be going for a visit. “However, the two, later confessed they were going for hustle in Dubai. Another three, of the girls, claimed they were going to India for medical treatment without referrals. “When further asked the nature of sickness they said yellow fever before they finally confessed to be going for hustle in India,” he said. “The Comptroller-General of NIS, Mr Muhammad Babandede, therefore, called on parents to be wary of juicy offers on their children, from family and non-family members to take their children abroad. “Most of these trips are deceitful, camouflaged with employment, studies or visit which may end up in exploitation or death. Operatives at the various entry and exit points will never permit them departure. “The NIS has stepped up clearance operation that is yielding positive result in the various arrests made at the borders of the country,” NAN quoted him as saying.

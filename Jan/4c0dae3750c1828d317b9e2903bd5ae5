U.S. President, Donald Trump, on Saturday said that Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei “should be very careful” about what he says. “The so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ of Iran, who has not been so Supreme lately, had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe. “Their economy is crashing, and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words!,” Trump said on Twitter. The US and Iran have been on a warpath since Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ (IRGC) elite Quds Force, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. The strike also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy commander of the Iran-backed militias in Iraq known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. Khamenei has repeatedly threatened the US with retaliation. After Soleimani’s killing, he said: “All friends – & enemies – know that Jihad of Resistance will continue with more motivation & definite victory awaits the fighters on this blessed path. “The loss of our dear General is bitter. The continuing fight & ultimate victory will be more bitter for the murderers & criminals”.

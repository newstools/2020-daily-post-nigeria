The All Progressives Congress, APC, has assured people of Kogi State that Governor Yahaya Bello would focus on people-oriented policies during his second tenure. The party also promised that Bello will not take Kogi citizens granted in his second term. The party gave the assurance while congratulating Bello on his inauguration for a second term in office on Monday. APC also congratulated Edward Onoja as he takes the oath of office as the Deputy Governor of the state. A statement by the APC spokesperson, Mallam Lanre Issa-Onilu, on Sunday, reads: “In the last governorship election, the people of Kogi State demonstrated unequivocally their implicit trust and confidence in the governor, thereby renewing the mandate of the APC-led government. “We assure Kogites that the governor would not take this sacred trust for granted and would continue to clean the rot bequeathed by past PDP administrations and galvanise the resources of the state towards uplifting the confluence state and taking It to the next level. “Our great party is confident that the Governor Bello-led administration will justify the overwhelming reelection mandate bestowed on the administration by the good people of Kogi State, by redoubling its efforts in harnessing the state’s massive potentials and bringing people-focused development to the state.”

Angry Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard has slammed his central defenders after Brighton’s Alireza Jahanbakhsh’s brilliant overhead kick denied the Blues their victory on Sunday. Anthony Rudiger and Kurt Zouma were in the middle of Chelsea’s defence as the Blues dropped two points. Frank Lampard ‘s men looked to be coasting to victory before the Iranian’s moment of magic for Brighton. Lampard was furious and frustrated that his players failed to follow instructions. “It was an incredible equaliser — but that was two points dropped. If we had been ruthless in the first half, the game would have been out of sight,” Lampard was quoted by The Sun, UK. “We didn’t have multiple chances but we had control and opportunities to play people in. Yet we didn’t do it. Sometimes you can accuse teams of a lack of fight or urgency. “But today was about a lack of quality on the ball. At the start we could find the full-backs easily and then we stopped doing the simple things. “We started to give the ball away and didn’t take our chances. When that happens you don’t win games.”

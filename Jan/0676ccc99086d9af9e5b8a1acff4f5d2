Luck has run out of the member representing Isiala-Mbano/Okigwe/Onuimo federal constituency (Okigwe North), Obinna Onwubuariri following his woeful outing at the just concluded rerun election across the three LGAs last Saturday. Our reporter who monitored the exercise witnessed what people referred to as a protest vote against the lawmaker whom they said had put up a lacklustre performance throughout his four years at the National Assembly. The election which was keenly contested by three candidates from the PDP(Obinna Onwubuariri), APC(Princess Miriam Onuoha) and that of APGA candidate, was hitch-free as the winner emerged without recourse to malpractices or irregularities. The APC candidate in the race, Princess Miriam Onuoha polled a total number of 23690 as against Obinna Onwubuariri of the PDP who got 9710.

According to her, the constituency has not enjoyed the best of representation especially in the last four years. This, she stated was her major priority, asking the people to be expectant of quality and result-oriented representation. She thanked the electorates for coming out en masse to exercise their franchise and protecting same till the final announcement. In a related development, the All Progressives Congress candidate for Orlu/Orsu/Oru-east, Edwin Iheanacho as well as Ambassador Uju Onwudiwe of Njaba state Assembly elections emerged winners at the various constituencies.

President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the Boko Haram killing of Lawan Andimi, chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in Michika local government area of Adamawa state. Buhari, in a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, described the murder as cruel, inhuman and deliberately provocative. He expressed sorrow that the terrorists went on to kill the religious leader while giving signals at the same time of a willingness to set him free by releasing him to third parties. “President Buhari consoles the Christian community all over Nigeria, the government and people of Adamawa state and the Bishop’s family over the sad loss of the man of God and assures that terrorists will continue to pay a heavy price for their actions and would comprehensively be defeated by our determined armed forces. “President urged nations of the world to end all support provided to Boko Haram and Islam in West Africa, ISWA terrorist groups whose only goal is to sow death, violence and destruction in the sub-region”, the statement read. Andimi was abducted by Boko Haram when they attacked Michika on January 3. Initially, he was declared missing but later appeared in a video released by Boko Haram, wherein he pleaded with authorities to secure his release. Michaka and some other areas in North-eastern Nigeria have been repeatedly attacked by Boko Haram.

The Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) is to generate N500 billion towards the implementation of the 2020 budget. The state Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Sam Egube, said this while giving a ‘Detailed Analysis of Year 2020 Budget’ on Tuesday. Egube said that the budget of N1.16 trillion would be funded from a total revenue estimate of N1.07 trillion. ”A significant percentage of the projected Total Internally Generated Revenue (TIGR) of N500 billion is expected to be contributed by LIRS. ”We shall achieve this by expanding the tax net through the deployment of technology, amongst other initiatives, which include massive investments in technology and other facilities to improve the efficiency in operations of all revenue generating agencies. ”We believe that there are huge revenue generating opportunities in the informal sector, including real estates, transportation, markets, for which Lagos State is known for,” NAN quoted the commissioner as saying. Egube said that the 2020 budget of N1.16 trillion was made up of N711.03 billion for Capital Expenditure and N457.52 billion for Recurrent Expenditure, giving a 61:39 Capital to Recurrent expenditure. Under recurrent expenditure, the Total Personnel Costs would account for N167.90 billion; the Total Overhead Costs N249.93 billion, while the Debt Charges would be N39.69 billion. ”The recurrent expenditure is moderated at a level of 39 per cent of the Total Expenditure, out of which the personnel cost is N167 billion, representing 14.4 per cent of the Total Expenditure, which is well within the fiscal sustainability ratio of 25 per cent. ”This budgetary provision for personnel cost takes into consideration, the new minimum wage. ”Capital expenditure accounts for 61 per cent of the total budget size.

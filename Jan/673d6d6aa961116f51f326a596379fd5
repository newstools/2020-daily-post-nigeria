Ebonyi State Government on Thursday sealed over 15 illegal gas stations located along the major streets of Abakaliki, the capital. The sealing of the said illegal gas stations, followed the directive of the State Governor, Chief David Umahi to avert explosion within the state capital. Recall that the governor had on Wednesday said the decision to shutdown the stations became imperative to forestall possible outbreak of fire incident in the state. In a statement signed by his Special Assistant on Media , Francis Nweze, the governor said the closure of the gas stations was apt, especially in this period of harmattan.  Following the governor’s directive, a task force was raised to carry out the order. Members of the task force include the Commissioner for Internal Security, Stanley Okoro Emegha, the Special Adviser on Petroleum, Basil Chima and members of the Abakaliki Capital Territory Developmental Board (ACTDB) Speaking to journalists shortly after the exercise, Mr Chima said the state government had mapped out land for gas stations but the operators have refused to move to the site. He said that only one station in the city has all the approvals and licences to operate in the state. Chairman of ACTDB, Uche Onwe said the state government cannot afford to sit and watch the state being destroyed by carelessness of the operators who have continued to build the stations close to residential areas. According to him: “The state capital today has been transformed into one of the most beautiful cities in the country and we cannot allow it to be put into danger.” Commissioner for Security, Stanley Okoro said the the stations will remain closed till they upgrade their facilities to the standard required. “To have approval (to build) is different from license to sell from DPR. We have sealed them before but how they managed to reopen is what I don’t know,” he said

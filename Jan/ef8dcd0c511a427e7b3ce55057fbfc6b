President Muhammadu Buhari has condoled with the Katsina State Government and Katsina Emirate Council in particular on the passing away of the District Head of Faskari, Alhaji Usman Sa’idu, Sarkin Yanma. A statement to DAILY POST from the Senior Special Assistant to the President, Garba Shehu, said Buhari described Alhaji Sa’idu as “a deeply compassionate and God-fearing man who was very zealous about matters affecting the development of the Emirate in particular and Katsina State in general. “Alhaji Sa’idu would be remembered for his contributions to the stability of the Emirate, and always standing as a pillar of support for the Emir of Katsina, who will miss his wise counsels.” He prayed that God will repose the soul of the departed and comfort the traditional ruler’s family, friends, and associates affected by the loss.

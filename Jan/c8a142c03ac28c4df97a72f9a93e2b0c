Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has singled out one of his players for praise after their 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday. He praised the performance of midfielder Fred during the game, even though his side could not fulfill the promise of stopping Liverpool. Solskjaer’s side struggled to make the most of their scoring chances at Anfield and Andreas Pereira and Anthony Martial squandered a couple of excellent opportunities. There were, however, a few standout performers including Fred, who impressed with his attacking and defensive play on the day. Fred won three tackles and made four interceptions in the defence and was also impressive in the attack with two key passes, three take-ons and three successful long balls, according to Whoscored. The Brazilian was constantly on the move throughout the 90 minutes, displaying a high workrate. “He’s a top, top performer. All the supporters can see now why we believe in him,” Solskjaer told Man United official website. “He covers every blade of grass on the pitch and wins challenges. Of course he is more confident on the ball. “I’m very pleased with Fred.”

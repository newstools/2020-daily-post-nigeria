A high court in Adamawa State has sentenced a man to death for killing his son. The man, Bappa Alti of Ganji village in Gombi Local Government Area, is to die by hanging for beheading his son, Buba Bappa, for ritual purposes. The state High Court VII in the capital, Yola which is presided over by Justice Fatima Tafida, convicted Bappa, a herder, for causing the death of his son by hitting him with cattle herding stick and then cutting off his head with a cutlass. It was learnt Thursday that the convict was asked by some ritualists to kill his son for them to make money for him, flowing which he started planning the murder. The convict was said to have seized an opportunity on June 13, 2013 when he and his son went to the bush for cattle rearing. Bappa was said to have hit his son, as a result of which the son fell on the ground, and then used his cutlass to complete the mess. It was recalled that when the convict came back home in the evening of the fateful day, he feigned ignorance of his sonâ€™s whereabouts, forcing a search party into action. The search party which found the headless body of the son on the second day of search, grew suspicious of the father and got him arrested. The Gombi Divisional Police headquarters, which took the matter up, launched an investigation, which was taken over by the Criminal Investigation Department Yola where Bappa confessed to the offence. He was later arraigned before the court for culpable homicide punishable with death.

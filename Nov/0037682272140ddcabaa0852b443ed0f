African Bar Association, AFBA, has said that the International Criminal Court, ICC, will come into the shooting of armless protesters at Lekki Toll Gate. AFBA, through its President, Hannibal Uwaifo, described the shooting of unarmed people as a crime of unimaginable proportion, adding that such a crime is within the parameters of the ICC “The group of soldiers and those who authorized them violated the rights of the protesters. If soldiers are sent to quell a peaceful protest and, in the process, they kill protesters, it is assumed that you sent soldiers to kill people,” Uwaifo said as quoted by Vanguard. According to him, “saying that you didn’t tell soldiers to kill won’t be acceptable. Like I said you are said to intend the natural consequence which flows from the act. And that natural consequence of shooting at peaceful protesters is death.” He, however, pointed out that the ICC can come into the matter when it has been established that the Federal Government does not have the capacity to investigate the crime or unwilling to do so. He said by then the ICC will step in to carry out a proper investigation and issue an international warrant of arrest on those concerned. Uwaifo further noted that when this happens, the top hierarchy of the military and all those fingered in the act will be affected.

Newspaper vendors in Abuja are protesting the death of their colleague, Ifeanyi Elechi. Elechi was fatally shot on Thursday by a security operative attached to Femi Gbajabiamila, House of Representatives Speaker. The incident happened within the Three Arms Zone as the lawmaker’s convoy journeyed. The Surulere representative in a statement confirmed that the officer has been suspended. On Friday, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command stated that the culprit was not a policeman. ASP Mariam Yusuf, the Public Relations Officer, FCT Command, disclosed that Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma has ordered an investigation. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-855587" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105447.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1536" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105447.jpg 2048w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105447-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105447-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105447-1536x1152.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-855588" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105444.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1536" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105444.jpg 2048w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105444-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105444-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201120_105444-1536x1152.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px"> Newspaper Vendors in Abuja conducting peaceful protest over  the death of colleague, Ifeanyi Elechi. pic.twitter.com/jGsk4ruzkD — #RevolutionNow (@RevolutionNowNg) November 20, 2020

Teachers’ Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) has said no fewer than 17,600 candidates across the country will sit for the 2020 qualifying examinations. Registrar and Chief Executive, Prof. Josiah Ajiboye, confirmed that the test will be held from November 12 to 14. On Tuesday in Abuja, he told the media that Osun State tops with 1,727 candidates; Adamawa State – 1,623; Nasarawa State – 934, and the FCT – 850. Ajiboye disclosed that Jigawa and Ekiti states were excluded from the computer-based examination for their failure to meet the benchmark of 100 candidates per state. He added that examination dates were staggered to ensure social distancing and compliance with other COVID-19 guidelines. Ajiboye recalled that in 2019, three batches of the test were conducted but reduced to two in 2020 due to coronavirus. “The effect of the pandemic was so much that learning almost ceased, but for the emergency remote learning techniques like radio and television we adopted. “When we started the computer based test in 2018 it was as if we knew there was going to be COVID-19 which would change the way teaching and learning is conducted.” The professor expressed satisfaction that those who were not IT savvy are now focused on learning how to use technology for teaching.

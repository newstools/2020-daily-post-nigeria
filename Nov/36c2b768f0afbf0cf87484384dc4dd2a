Welsh star, Gareth Bale was unable to make it off the bench against Manchester city so will be running to get time in the pitch in the Europa League. Charismatic manager José Mourinho is expected to recall Gareth Bale to the Spur starting line-up when they take on Ludogorets in the Europe league. The London side is coming from a superb 2-0 home win against Pep Guardiola’s men on Saturday but with them needing to hold onto their lead against the Manchester City side for the remainder of the game, the Welshman’s input was not needed from the bench. He should come in for this tie as one of the fresh legs. In the attack, he could feature alongside Carlos Vinicius and Giovani Lo Celso, even as the latter came on to score in the second half against the visitor’s Manchester City. Tottenham have one new injury worry in their squad, as Toby Alderweireld came off with an injury on Saturday. This could mean Davinson Sanchez returning to the starting line-up. With Japhet Tanganga out injured and Joe Rodon still ineligible to play, Sanchez could be pitched alongside Eric Dier in the heart of Tottenham’s defence. Matt Doherty tested positive for coronavirus and is abruptly ruled out meaning Serge Aurier will continue at right-back. But Ben Davies would come in for Sergio Regulion on the left-back. Joe Hart will deputize for Hugo Lloris in goal. Harry Winks could likely start in place of Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. Tottenham Hotspurs’ possible line up list against Ludogorets Razgrad; Joe Hart; Sergio Aurier, Eric Dier, Davinson Sanchez, Ben Davies; Moussa Sissoko, Harry Winks; Gareth Bale, Giovani Lo Celso, Lucas Moura; Carlos Vinicius.

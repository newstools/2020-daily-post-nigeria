Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has said that former President Goodluck Jonathan-led administration will long be remembered as the government that practiced the rule of law and freedom of expression. The governor stated this while congratulating Jonathan, as he clocks 63-years on Friday. Okowa, in a statement by Mr Olisa Ifeajika, his Chief Press Secretary, on Thursday in Asaba, commended Jonathan for his unique statesmanship and graceful disposition to issues. He said, “On behalf of the government and people of Delta, I congratulate our leader and statesman, Dr Goodluck Jonathan, as he celebrates his 63rd birth anniversary. “Your Excellency, it gives me pleasure to celebrate you for your continuous role in deepening democracy in our dear country and Africa. “Your administration will long be remembered as the government that practiced the rule of law and freedom of expression as there were no records of human rights abuses throughout your tenure.” Okowa also prayed for God to strengthen the former president in his avowed commitment to ensuring good governance and peace in Africa.

Real Madrid boss, Zinedine Zidane, has ruled out any possibility of defender, Raphael Varane leaving the club amid links from Manchester United. Man United have long been admirers of Varane and are keen to add a centre-back next summer transfer window. Speaking on the development before Real Madrid’s La Liga clash against Villarreal on Saturday, Zidane insisted that the French star was not for sale at any price. “It is not just me [who wants to keep him],” Zidane said as quoted by Metro UK. “He’s part of this club. We were very lucky to be able to bring him to [Real] Madrid. “He has a great career, he has achieved a lot since he has been here. Of course, he’s untransferable for the club, for the coach that I’m, for people in general. “That is clear and unambiguous. Now we cannot stop people from talking. They are not just talking about Varane, but about all the players, Real Madrid ones and others. “But for Varane, my position is clear, and it is the same as the club’s position.”

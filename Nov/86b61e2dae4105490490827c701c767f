Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) has stopped sponsorship of conference attendance for Nigerian lecturers. Executive Secretary, Suleiman Bogoro, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that a probe of the intervention was ongoing. The suspension followed alleged diversion of sponsorship grants given to lecturers to attend local and international conferences. Bagoro confirmed that the investigating team was yet to complete its task. The official said factors and loopholes that caused leakages are being identified and will be tackled. “The COVID-19 lockdown contributed to slow pace of the work but we hope in a matter of few months we will conclude it and we will let you know the outcome,” he said. Bogoro added that it was unacceptable for funds meant for human capital development to be channeled to other uses.

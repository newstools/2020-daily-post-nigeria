The Nigerian military, on Monday, turned down a question about calls on President Muhammadu Buhari to sack Service Chiefs due to Boko Haram and ISWAP attacks. Hashtag #SackTheServiceChiefs is trending after the Saturday massacre in Borno. The funeral of 43 Zabarmari farmers killed by Boko Haram was held on Sunday. The victims were brutally murdered at Koshebe village in Mafa Local Government Area. On Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily, Major General John Enenche, Coordinator of Defence Media Operations, refused to comment on the clamour for a change of military heads. “You are not being fair to me, asking me that question about change of service chiefs. It is beyond me,” the spokesman told the interviewer. Reacting to the United Nations’ position that terrorists murdered as many as 110 civilians at the weekend, Enenche said it remains unconfirmed. “I knew it (the UN figure) is going to come up because it is coming from the United Nations and not a source that does not want to be identified. This is a source that has identified itself that 110 specifically (were murdered).” The General confirmed that some people ran into the bush during the attack but had started returning. “As at 2 pm yesterday (Sunday), I called them and they got back to me at about 7 pm yesterday, still counting, looking if they will recover (more corpses). We call it Exploitation after Action Review.” The General noted that military officials and Governor Babagana Zulum counted 43 bodies. “We may count up to the figure he gave in the future. But as it is, what we have counted with the locals is still 43. And we are hoping that we don’t get beyond that”, Enenche added. During his visit to Zabarmari, locals informed Zulum that a number of indigenes were still missing.

President Donald Trump of the United States has finally given a go-ahead for the Biden-Harris transition to begin. Trump in a tweet on Monday said that he was directing his team to cooperate on the transition. However, the Republican standard bearer vowed to keep up the fight. Trump wrote that Emilly Murphy, Head of General Services Administration, GSA, and her team should “do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same.” “I want to thank Emily Murphy at GSA for her steadfast dedication and loyalty to our Country,” Trump wrote. “She has been harassed, threatened, and abused – and I do not want to see this happen to her, her family, or employees of GSA. “Our case STRONGLY continues, we will keep up the good fight, and I believe we will prevail! Nevertheless, in the best interest of our Country, I am recommending that Emily and her team do what needs to be done with regard to initial protocols, and have told my team to do the same,” he added. Despite losing the presidential election with over 270 college votes, according to US electoral guidelines, President Trump has refused to concede. The incumbent has filed a flurry of lawsuits challenging the outcome of the election which went in favour of Democratic candidate, Joe Biden. Trump is alleging election fraud and corruption but has not been able to substantiate his claims, according to US media.

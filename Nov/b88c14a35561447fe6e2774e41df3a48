Chelsea striker, Tammy Abraham, has reacted to his side’s Premier League 2-0 victory against Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon. Abraham described Chelsea’s win over Newcastle as fantastic, adding that Frank Lampard’s side defended well against the host. Chelsea defeated Newcastle United at St. James’ Park, thanks to an own goal from Federico Fernandez and a second half strike from Abraham. “It was a fantastic result. It’s never easy to come here and get a result,” Abraham told a post-match press conference after the game. “We defended well, but we came out all guns blazing. “These games can be tricky when we are 1-0 up, searching for a second. But we kept ongoing. “I had to get myself forward and move to get the ball between the goalkeeper and the post. “We are top of the league, and that’s where we want to be.”

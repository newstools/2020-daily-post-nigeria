A member of the House of Representatives, Kabiru Adamu, has advised the North to change its attitude. He noted that most people in the North solely depend on the government to do everything for them. He stressed that this remains one of the factors delaying the progress of the region. The lawmaker spoke to DAILY POST on Saturday after he distributed some items to youths in his constituency. Adamu accused leaders and elders of leaving the youths in total penury. “I am not happy seeing our youths being wasted even when there are enough rich people in the society. That is the main reason southerners continue to claim that northerners are very lazy set of people in the country”, he said. The Gusau, Tsafe Federal Constituency representative decried that rich men in the zone only focus on their families and relations. “No society can definitely progress with such kind of attitude being operated in the North. I am, therefore, calling on the northern elders to change their mindsets for a positive change. “There is no doubt in saying that the northern region of the country remains the poorest. The elders know this very clearly but have refused to take drastic action in addressing the ugly trend.” Adamu added that banditry in Zamfara State was partly caused by leaders who failed to assist the youths.

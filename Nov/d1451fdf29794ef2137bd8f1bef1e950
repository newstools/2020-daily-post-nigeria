Governors elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) have reiterated their commitment and loyalty to the party. Chairman of the PDP Governors Forum, Aminu Tambuwal, stated this on Thursday while speaking on behalf of his colleagues at the ongoing 90th NEC meeting of the party at the party’s National Secretariat, Wadata House, Abuja. “All 15 of us are here present. We are individually committed to good governance in our various states in order to make our party strong. “This is a clear statement that we are united and working towards strengthening our party for the future,” Tambuwal said. Tambuwal’s comments come after Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi dumped the party for the All Progressives Congress (APC). Umahi claimed he left PDP because they had not been fair to his region in the allotment of political offices, especially the presidency.

Juventus sporting director, Fabio Paratici, has dismissed reports linking Cristiano Ronaldo with a move away in 2021, insisting the forward will see out his contract at the club. Ronaldo’s contract runs until summer 2022, though it is claimed Juve are planning to cash-in on the 35-year-old at the end of this season. They are believed to be concerns over his age, coupled with his huge salary and the club’s financial problems were said to be factors behind the Serie A giants considering his sale. Paris Saint-Germain, Real Madrid and Manchester United have all been linked with Ronaldo. But Paratici said: “His future is with us, I can assure you. “There are transfer rumours every day and players that are linked with different clubs but we don’t pay much attention to that.” —

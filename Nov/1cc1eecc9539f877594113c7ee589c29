Former Liverpool goalkeeper, Ray Clemence, is dead. Clemence passed on at the age of 72. Liverpool announced his death in a statement on their official website on Sunday. The statement read in part: “Liverpool Football Club is deeply saddened by the passing of Reds legend Ray Clemence, aged 72. “The former goalkeeper, rated by many as the greatest ever to represent Liverpool between the posts, won practically everything – often multiple times – across his 13 years and 665 appearances in the first team.” Clemence was signed by former Liverpool manager, Bill Shankly as the Reds dominated the 1970s. He ultimately became kings of Europe under Bob Paisley. Clemence won three European Cups, five league titles, two UEFA Cups, a UEFA Super Cup, an FA Cup and a League Cup during his time at Liverpool.

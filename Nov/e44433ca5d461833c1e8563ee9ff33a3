Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said he is “hurt” by Mesut Ozil’s exile from the first team. In an interview with beINSPORT, Arteta also suggested the midfielder has not “earned the right” to play under him. Ozil was not included in the Gunners’ 25-man squad for both the Premier League and Europa League and looks unlikely to ever play for the club again before his deal expires in June. And Arteta insists he is only doing what he feels is right. “I’m hurt because I don’t like any player in my squad not to have the possibility to participate, or to compete, for me it is really sad because I don’t think anybody deserves that. “But at the end of the day I’m sitting here to make decisions, to make the decisions that, in my opinion, are the best for the football club. And this is what I have to do,” he said.

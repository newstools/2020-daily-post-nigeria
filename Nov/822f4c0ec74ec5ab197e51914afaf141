The Director General of the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), Mallam Kashifu Inuwa Abdullahi, has said that the emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics are going to power the fourth industrial revolution. This, he said while delivering a goodwill message at the National Engineering Conference and Annual General Meeting of the Nigeria Society of Engineers, NSE, on Tuesday at the International Conference Centre, ICC, Abuja. The conference themed: “Engineering Education and Lifelong Learning Opportunities for Sustainable Development” was attended by creme de la’ creme and veteran engineers across the country and beyond. Speaking further, Abdullahi hinted that all the previous industrial revolutions were powered by engineers and now that we are at the verge of the fourth industrial revolution makes the conference even timelier. Abdullahi noted that Africa, as a continent, lost out in the first, second and third industrial revolutions but now we are at the verge of the fourth industrial revolution which is going to be powered by Artificial Intelligence and Augmentive reality and other technologies to change the way we work. “Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics are changing the way we design, plan and execute engineering projects” he muted. At NITDA, he said, “having this knowledge at the back of our minds, we are preparing the country to be digital technology inclined and just last week the Honourable Minister for Communications and Digital Economy commissioned the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics built by the Agency. “This is the right time for you to learn how these new technologies are going to help you excel and thrive in this world we are creating, a digital world,” he affirmed. Abdullahi also hinted that the centre is equipped with the state of the art facilities that can help design and produce prototype solutions for the fourth industrial revolution and as such the Agency is looking forward to receiving a communique from this conference to see how we can work together and build innovation ecosystem in Nigeria and prepare our country for the fourth industrial revolution.

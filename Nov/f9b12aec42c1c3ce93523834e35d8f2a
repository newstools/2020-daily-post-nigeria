US President Donald Trump on Sunday admitted that Joe Biden, candidate of the Democratic Party, won the November 3 election. However, he alleged that Biden won because the election was rigged. With this many believe the Republican candidate is edging closer towards conceding defeat. Recall that Trump, while addressing the press at the White House on Friday expressed uncertainty over his White House chances. In a tweet on Sunday, Trump said Biden won through mass fraud “He won because the Election was Rigged,” he tweeted. “NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company.” Trump has insisted that he won the presidential election before now, and recently expressed hope of being declared winner of the election, saying results that would be announced next week would put him ahead of Bide Trump has also filed a flurry of court cases challenging Biden’s victory in the election which he (Trump) alleged was marred by massive corruption and fraud.

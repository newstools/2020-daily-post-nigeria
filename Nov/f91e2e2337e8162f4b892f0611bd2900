The Kano State Coalition of Ulamas and Non-Governmental Organizations has urged Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to sack all Frenchmen in the services of the state government. Following President Emmanuel Macron’s announcement of his intentions to fight Islamist separatism and describing the faith as one in crisis, Muslim leaders expressed disapproval and condemnation of what it termed French blasphemy. Reacting, the Kano Islamic group in a statement signed by its Organising Secretary Dr. Saidu Dukawa, called for the immediate replacement of French language with the Arabic language in the curriculum of all public schools in the state. “The caricature, which the French history teacher mocked his Muslim students with are in contravention of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as it affects the right to choice of religion. “The French President, Emanuel Macron, was not only insensitive to the feelings and sensibilities of the six million Muslims in France, and by extension that of the close to two billion Muslims worldwide, but his action is also acrimonious, hateful, venomous and vile. “The subsequent crackdown on mosques and Muslim schools in France by Macron is tantamount to matching words with action that Macron and his administration are all out to fight Muslims. “Consequent upon the foregoing observations, the coalition resolved that Muslims worldwide should consider Macron and his administration as paragons of Islamophobia. “The coalition supports and affirms its loyalty to all Muslim leaders who expressed condemnation for the actions of Macron and his administration and calls for continuous prayer for them,” the statement said.

Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has said that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side still have the “mentality” to end their title drought and become English Premier League, EPL, champions this season. Fernandes stated this ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash against West Brom on November 21. Man United have not lifted the Premier League title since the club’s former manager, Sir Alex Ferguson left Old Trafford in 2013. Solskjaer’s men finished third last season and are currently in the 14th position on the log this term. “For me, it does not matter about the other teams,” Fernandes told Man Utd podcast. “People may say they are better than us, they have a better first eleven than us, guys who come from the bench are better. “People can say what they think, I do not care. For a club like United, it’s a long time since we won the Premier League. “It is too long, I think. So you have to have in your mind – all the players, all the staff – we are here to win. And I think we have that mentality. “I came to Manchester to win trophies. You are playing for one of the biggest clubs in the world. This club has made history in the past, an amazing history.”

The draw for the FA Cup second round was conducted on Monday night. Canvey Island’s third round dream is still within touching distance after they paired them with fellow Non-League side Boreham Wood. Marine, who stunned League One side Colchester United with a penalty shootout win in their first-round upset, will also be in an all Non-League tie as they face Havant & Waterlooville for a spot in the third round. Chorley’s reward for knocking Wigan out of the FA Cup is a tie against Peterborough. Elsewhere, new Salford City are away to League Two high-fliers Newport County, who have enjoyed a number of fine cup runs in recent seasons. All ties will take place from November 27-30, with the Championship and Premier League sides joining in the third round.

A former Real Madrid and Liverpool player, Michael Owen, has predicted that Chelsea will secure a win against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League on Sunday evening. Owen also backed Southampton to hold Manchester United to a draw in today’s Premier League tie at St. Mary’s. According to him, Arsenal will beat Wolves when both teams clash in the Premier League at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday night. Owen told BetVictor, “I am really looking forward to covering this one live. It should be a cracker, but it is so hard to call! “One player that is standing out for me at Spurs right now is Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg. He is exactly the type of player that Jose Mourinho likes in his side. “With both these teams having such quality in attacking areas, I think there will be over 2.5 goals in the game with Chelsea just shading it 2-1.” On the Southampton vs Man United game, Owen said: “I covered Southampton’s game against Newcastle the other week, and they were exceptional. “In my opinion, Ralph Hasenhuttl is going places. “Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is still trying to work out what his best starting eleven is. “I think this will be tight, and given the recent form of both sides, I can see this ending in a score draw.” Commenting on the Arsenal vs Wolves match, Owen added: “On a few occasions this season, Mikel Arteta has opted to sit in. If he decides to do that here, it might invite Wolves to attack and leave some space for the Gunners to counter. “If it plays out like this, I can see the Gunners shading it, with Aubameyang getting back amongst the goals.” The kick-off time for Arsenal vs Wolves is 8:15 pm, while that of Chelsea vs Tottenham is 5:30 pm and Southampton vs Man United is 3 pm.

Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has confirmed that Mohamed Salah will return for the Champions League clash at home against Atalanta. However, Salah looks like the only player Klopp will have available from their lengthy injury list. The Egypt international missed the 3-0 win over Leicester on Sunday, as he remained in isolation following two positive COVID-19 tests recorded on international duty. “Mo trained yesterday and looked really good,” Klopp told his press conference on Tuesday. “All the tests were negative so he’s available if nothing changes.” With Virgil Van Dijk and Joe Gomez sidelined with long-term injuries, and the likes of Jordan Henderson, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Thiago Alcantara, Xherdan Shaqiri, Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain also out, Klopp was asked if any more players will be able to feature, however that looks doubtful. “All the rest, no news,” he added.

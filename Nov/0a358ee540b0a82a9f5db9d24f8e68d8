The governor disclosed that the suspects are currently being investigated by the police with a view to ascertaining their levels of involvement in crimes before being brought to face justice. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853412" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201105-WA0006.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201105-WA0006.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201105-WA0006-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"> According to the governor, “My elder brother was abducted when I was in isolation, we want to thank the Inspector General of Police who came with all the force. “I want to use this opportunity to say that all of them have been arrested and they are facing the wrath of the law.” Governor Mohammed warned criminals to steer clear of the state, declaring that with the partnership between the state government and security agencies in the state, criminals will be fished out and made to face the full wrath of the law. “We will not sleep, we will not leave any stone unturned to allow miscreants, hooligans and criminals to go scot-free. “I am sending a warning that anybody who does that, they should be assured that we have a very good rapport and an arrangement with the police and other security agencies to catch up with them and that is what will stop the prevalence of crime,” he said. While lamenting that crimes are being committed in the state at the state borders, especially at the Falgore forest around Ningi, Toro, Tafawa Balewa and Alkaleri local government areas of the state, Mohammed stated that security agencies have been living up to expectations. “We are happy that our security agencies are working very hard. You have seen what the Nigerian Air Force is doing, what the Nigerian Army and the Police (are doing). “There have been kidnappings and abductions but because of the intensification of joint patrol, we have been able to secure the release of all those abducted by the kidnappers,” he added. He assured that his administration will collaborate with the state House of Assembly to ensure that security agencies in the state are adequately supported for them to perform their duties. He drew the attention of security agencies to forests at Liman Katagum area of the state, where the governor said criminals are harbouring. Governor Mohammed stated that in the past, there had been unholy compromises between criminals and lower traditional leaders in the state and warned that nobody would be spared if caught. According to Governor Mohammed, “there are some forests at the Liman Katagum area, criminals are harbouring. I assure you that we will do all we can with our Assembly to make sure that we rekit our security agencies, we give them support and even our traditional institutions, including you (the religious leaders) so that everyone will live up to his/her expectations. “We have sent warnings and reprimand that nobody will be spared if the common man, your followers are touched.” Speaking earlier, The Most Reverend Dachelem commended the peaceful atmosphere in the state, saying that this was possible because of efforts put in place by the governor to ensure security of lives and property of residents of the state irrespective of their religious, ethnic or political affiliations. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-853413" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201105-WA0008.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201105-WA0008.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201105-WA0008-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"> He assured that the Catholic Diocese, with over 200,000 faithful will continue to do its best to promote peaceful coexistence among the people in the State.

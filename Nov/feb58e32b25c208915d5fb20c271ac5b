Popular American singer, Bobby Brown has lost his son, Bobby Jr. TMZ reports that the 28-year-old was found dead on Wednesday in his home in the L.A. area. However, police officials who were at the scene of the incident said they do not believe there was any foul play that resulted in the death. Bobby Jr. who was one of Bobby’s seven children also appeared on the family’s short-lived Bravo reality show, “Being Bobby Brown.” His mother, Kim Ward, dated Bobby off and on for 11 years before he got engaged to Whitney. Recall that Bobby Jr’s half-sister, Bobbi Kristina, died when she was just 22 years old after she was found lifeless in the bathtub of her Georgia home. Also, similar to Kristina’s death, her mother, Whitney Houston, died three years earlier from an accidental overdose while in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton Hotel.

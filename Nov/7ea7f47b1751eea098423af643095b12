Former Chelsea star, Jason Cundy, has warned Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, that defeat against Everton this weekend, could see him sacked. Solskjaer is under pressure at Old Trafford, after losing three home fixtures in four. This leaves United in the bottom six of the table. Their next league game is a trip to face Carlo Ancelotti’s Everton. Cundy has claimed that a defeat ahead of the imminent international break, could push the United board into sacking Solskjaer. On this weekend’s clash, he told talkSPORT: “The game against Everton is enormous. “United’s away record since January/February has been excellent, no defeats. “If they lose, this international break I think he goes. “This is massive for Ole, I think if they were to lose against [Everton] then that international break… that can be a graveyard for some managers.”

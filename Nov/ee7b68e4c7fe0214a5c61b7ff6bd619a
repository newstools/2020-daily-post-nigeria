The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Thursday, arraigned Prince Lasberry Okafor Anyanwu before Justice E. F. Njemanze of the Imo State High Court for alleged fraud. Anyanwu was Commissioner for Transport and Chairman, Imo State Transport Company in ex-Governor Rochas Okorocha, administration. He is being prosecuted on four-count charges, bordering on conspiracy, abuse of office, stealing and misappropriation of public funds to the tune of N180million. In count three, EFCC stated that Anyanwu between November 6 and 10, 2017, as Chairman, Committee on Review of Imo Transport Company, allegedly ordered the transfer of the company’s N100million in Polaris Bank to a different Polaris Bank account with No: 40906668828 owned by Oma Oil & Industries Ltd. The charge said the suspect is the chairman/chief executive of the firm and signatory to its bank account. The offence was contrary to under Section 19 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act, 2000. Anyanwu pleaded “not guilty” to all the charges. Victor Okereke, prosecution counsel, asked for a trial date and prayed the court to remand the defendant in Nigerian Correctional Service (NCoS) custody. J. C. Ezem, defence counsel, filed an application for Anyanwu’s bail. Justice Njemanze admitted him to bail in the sum of N20million, with two sureties. They must be resident in Owerri, swear affidavit of means and deposit two passports each. The judge adjourned the case until January 21 and 28, 2021.

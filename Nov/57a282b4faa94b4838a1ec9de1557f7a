A 40-year-old house wife, Iswat Taofeek, has confessed to the police in Ogun State that she burnt a12-year-old boy with a hot knife when she could not locate a sum of N5,000 she kept at home. The woman, a resident of 36, Isoka Kugba, Abeokuta has been arrested by men of Ogun State Police Command for dehumanizing the boy, who lives with her. DAILY POST learnt that the suspect was arrested at about 8:30am on Monday, following a complaint by one of her neighbours at Adatan police station with the little boy, whose body the police said was full of injuries inflicted on him with the hot knife and cutlass. While the report was being lodged, the little boy fainted at the station and was quickly rushed to a hospital for medical attention, a statement by Ogun police spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi confirmed to DAILY POST on Monday. Oyeyemi, said the DPO of Adatan division, CSP Samuel Aladegoroye, detailed his detectives to the woman’s house where she was arrested. “On interrogation, the suspect explained that the little boy is a son to her brother-in-law and he has been living with her for some time. She stated further that she kept the sum of N5,000 somewhere in the house but couldn’t find it and she believed that it was the boy who stole it. That was why she put a knife on fire until it was red-hot before she used it to burn the little boy all over his body,” Oyeyemi quoted the woman as saying. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police in Ogun State, Edward Ajogun, has ordered the transfer of the case to anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the State CIID for further investigation and prosecution

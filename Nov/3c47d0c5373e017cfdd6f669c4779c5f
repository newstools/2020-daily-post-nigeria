The Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Imo State Council, has condemned the acts of impunity being meted out to journalists and media practitioners in the course of discharging their duties. In a statement issued by the state Unionâ€™s chairman, Chris Akaraonye, the union expressed indignation that journalists and media workers were still being harassed, intimidated, physically attacked and in some cases killed in the line of duty. The union commiserated with families of fallen colleagues and other media workers whose lives were cut short while carrying out their legitimate duties. The statement further condemned the attacks on media houses in the country during the End SARS protests, describing the development as worrisome. The union called on governments at various levels to ensure the security and dignity of journalists and media workers at all times. It, however, extolled the courage and professionalism exhibited by some journalists and media workers in the face of daunting challenges of intimidation and attacks by security agencies, state and non-state actors. The union, however, pledged to always stand firm in defence of journalists and media workers who do their legitimate job in the state. In the same vein, the council promised to maintain the cordial relationship existing between journalists and security agencies in the state.

A lawyer Modupe (Moe) Odele says her passport is still with federal authorities. The End SARS advocate was stopped from boarding her international flight on Sunday. Odele said she was detained and her passport seized by officers. The legal practitioner gave an update on the matter Tuesday night. “Hello people, I went to retrieve my passport today but was told this: “We cannot release your passport because you are still under investigation”. “As of now, I’m not aware of any charges against me or what I am under investigation for”, she tweeted. Thousands of respondents are accusing the federal government of infringing on her rights. Earlier in the day, the Ministry of Interior said it was not targeting citizens. “The Ministry of Interior did not, has not and will not generate any no-fly list. Ignore fake news, please!”, it tweeted.

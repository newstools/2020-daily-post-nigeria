Governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu has advocated for the country to embark on reconciliation, reassurances and confidence building among all citizens as a way forward for the nation. The Governor made the call on Thursday while on a visit to his Lagos State counterpart, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu. Ikpeazu commiserated with families that lost loved ones and property during the protests. He also expressed sympathy to the Lagos State Governor over the attack on the residence of his mother and on the palace of the Oba of Lagos during the End SARS protest. He urged that people should learn from the supreme sacrifice made by Lt Col Adekunle Fajuyi, the military Governor of the former Western region, who defended his friend, Gen Aguiyi Ironsi even with his life. “That action of his has elevated the ceiling of expectations of love, loyalty and patriotism between the people of Abia State and those of the entire South West”, the Governor said. He further said that such supreme sacrifice paid for a friend should challenge us as a people of all divides and inclinations to be our brother’s keeper. However, he advised the people of Abia in Lagos to remain law abiding and supportive of the Government of the day.

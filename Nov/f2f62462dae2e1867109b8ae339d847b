Ex-Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Vee has cried out over endorsement deals from bleaching skin products. Vee took to her Twitter page on Thursday lamenting about deals from skin bleaching and slimming products brands. According to her, she would rather not represent such brands than do something she does not believe in. Vee wrote on her Twitter page “ Call me stubborn, but you can’t convince me to do something I don’t believe in or something that doesn’t represent my brand because “that’s how things are done in this country” “I have too many young girls following me to be the face of any skin bleaching products. I’m a size 10, so why would I be representing slimming products? “I refuse to be a cliche. If it takes me a little longer to get to where I wanna be, then so help me God. For the last time; Longevity > bragging rights.” It is not clear what brands Vee was referring to. However, Brighto and Dorathy recently got signed as ambassadors for skincare companies.

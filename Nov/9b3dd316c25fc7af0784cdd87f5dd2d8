Joe Biden has broken a major record with the United States election results. The Democrat is now the first presidential challenger to win more than 80 million popular votes, CNN reports. He is also the first presidential candidate to capture more than 50% of the popular vote against an incumbent since Franklin Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover in 1932. Biden’s tally are expected to go up as ballots are still being counted nationwide. The former Vice President hit 80,011,000 votes on Tuesday; President Donald Trump had more than 73,800,000. Biden has won 306 electoral votes – 36 more than the required 270; Trump has 232. The former Senator’s triumph is the seventh time in the last eight presidential elections a Democrat won the popular vote – 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012, 2016, 2020. On Monday, the General Services Administration (GSA) finally recognized his victory. But President Trump is yet to concede three weeks after the election. The Republican becomes the first president since Benjamin Harrison in 1892 to lose the popular vote in two successive polls.

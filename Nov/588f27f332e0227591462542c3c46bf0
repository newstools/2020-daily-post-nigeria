The funeral of Ghana’s late former president, Jerry John Rawlings, will be held on 23 December, his family announced on Monday. James Victor Gbeho, Head of the funeral planning committee, in a press release on Monday, said the family, in consultation with the government, has agreed on the date. The funeral rites for the 73-year-old will come off at the Independence Square in Accra. Mr Gbeho said, “The family is working in conjunction with the government on the finer details of the funeral ceremony and will communicate the arrangements in due course.” Rawlings, Ghana’s longest-serving head of state and founder of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), died on 12 November at the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra after a short illness.

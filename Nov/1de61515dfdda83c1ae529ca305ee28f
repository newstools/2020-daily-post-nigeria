Barely three days after police in Anambra State resumed duties, men of the state command have foiled a robbery operation in Onitsha, arresting two suspects. The state police command’s spokesperson, SP Haruna Mohammed, who disclosed this to DAILY POST, said firearm and ammunition were also recovered from the suspects, while a Toyota Venza car, suspected to have been stolen by the gang was also recovered. Since after the End SARS protest, which led to the burning down of most police facilities and killing of personnel, police have been off duty, giving cultists, robbers and other hoodlums the opportunity to operate freely around Anambra State. Mohammed who disclosed the arrest of the suspects said, “On the 14/11/2020 at about 10:05pm, there was a distress call that two suspected armed robbery gang were operating near Shoprite, Onitsha. “Following the distress call, Police operatives attached to the Command Rapid Response squad(RRS) quickly responded, rushed to the scene and arrested one Chibuike Okwuosa ‘m’ aged 24 years and one Odigbo Chidera ‘m’ aged 26 years, all residents of Awada. “Meanwhile, one revolver pistol, five rounds of .9mm live ammunition, one dagger and an unregistered Toyota Venza car were recovered from them.” Mohammed said the case had been referred to the State Criminal investigation department (SCID) for discreet investigation after which suspects would be charged to court for prosecution. He quoted the Commissioner of Police in the state, CP John B.Abang as assuring Anambra people of their safety and urged them not to relent in providing timely information to the Command.

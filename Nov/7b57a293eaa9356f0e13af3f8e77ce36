The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), University of Ibadan Chapter, has urged its members not to attend the institution’s convocation. ASUU in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday asked its members to boycott the 2020 Convocation and the foundation laying ceremonies of the University. DAILY POST gathered that the decision to boycott the convocation may not be unconnected with the ongoing strike embarked upon by the Union. ASUU Chairman, Professor Ayo Akinwole in a signed statement said the position of the Union is that holding convocation ceremonies is a violation of the principle of the ongoing strike. Akinwole maintained that the union is constrained to “advise members not to be in attendance or participate in the preparation for and the actualization of the said convocation and 72nd Foundation Day Ceremonies”. It was gathered that the union has also communicated her position via a letter written to the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Professor Idowu Olayinka. “The notice for the university of Ibadan 2020 Graduation and 72 foundation Day ceremonies come to our attention on Saturday 7th November 2020. “In the spirit of the current ASUU strike, holding graduation ceremonies at this time would be a violation of the principle of the ongoing strike to rescue public university education in Nigeria. “To the best of our knowledge, there was no request for a waiver for such to take place in the University of Ibadan”.

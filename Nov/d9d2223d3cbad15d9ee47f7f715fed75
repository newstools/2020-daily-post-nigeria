The National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, NAPTIP, has rescued no fewer than 83 victims of human trafficking in Ondo State. With three suspected traffickers currently being prosecuted at various courts in the state, the agency disclosed that the successes were made in the last three years. According to the Director-General of NAPTIP, Dame Julie Okah-Donli, during a training over the weekend for members of the task force on human trafficking in Ondo and Ekiti States held in Akure, said Ondo State was strategic in the fight against trafficking, hence the plan by NAPTIP to establish a state command in Akure. The Director General emphasized that the taskforce had been set up in 14 states of the federation with the support of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, UNODC, and International Organization for Migration, IOM. The representative of UNODC, Mr. Oliver Stolpe commended NAPTIP for the creation of the task force in fighting human trafficking in the country. Earlier, while hosting the NAPTIP Director General in his office in Akure, Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu emphasized the need to reorientate the youths in the country on the value of human dignity and pride. The Governor commended NAPTIP for its achievements so far, urging it to do more in rescuing youths from traffickers.

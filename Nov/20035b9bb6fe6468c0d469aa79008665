The Presidency has said feedback from across the country indicates that the Micro Small and Medium Enterprises, MSMEs, Survival Fund is achieving the desired result of giving succour to small businesses. Tola Johnson, the Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on MSMEs, attached to the Office of the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo disclosed this while giving an update on the ongoing implementation of MSMEs Survival Fund on Tuesday in Abuja, NAN reports. The Survival Fund Scheme for MSMEs is captured under the National Economic Sustainability Plan drafted by the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo-led Economic Sustainability Committee and approved by President Muhammadu Buhari. He said: “The assurance we are giving Nigerians is that this scheme was approved by the president; he has made provisions for the funding of the scheme. “Nothing is going to change; nothing is going to affect the approval; nothing is going to affect the implementation of the programme; nothing is going to affect the financial inclusion in the scheme, so whatever was promised to Nigerians will be adhered to. “You can see from across the country that people have started receiving salaries from the scheme; artisans have started getting funding; people have started registering new businesses and all these are not going to stop. “We are going into the next track- the Guaranteed Off take; we are going into the transport scheme and we are going to execute the general grant; nothing has changed in the scheme in terms of implementation.’’

Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has singled out N’Golo Kanté and Timo Werner for praise following the Blues’ Premier League 2-0 win over Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon. Lampard said that Kante’s level against Newcastle was really high, Werner was a real threat. Two goals from Federico Fernandez (OG) and Tammy Abraham gave Chelsea all three points against Newcastle at St. James’ Park. Chelsea is now on top of the Premier League table with 18 points from nine games following the victory. “He [Timo Werner] had a couple of chances to be fair to Timo. He was a real threat to us throughout the game,” Lampard told a post-match press conference after the game. “The pace at which he travelled with the ball was something special.
On Kante, Lampard added, “His levels are really high. He’s a top midfield player.” Chelsea will face Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge on 29 November in their next Premier League fixture.

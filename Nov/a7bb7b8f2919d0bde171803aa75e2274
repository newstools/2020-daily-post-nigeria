The defendants pleaded “not guilty” when the charges were read to them. EFCC presented evidence and witnesses who testified against them in court. In his judgment, Justice Omotosho found the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th and 11th defendants guilty on all counts. The judge sentenced them to seven years imprisonment with an option of fine of N2,000,000 each. The sentences run concurrently from their date of arraignment. The 1st, 8th, 9th and 10th defendants were freed on the grounds that “they were not linked to the commission of the crime”. The company involved Asztral Shipping Corporation SA was wound up by the court, while the vessel MT TECNE (MT STAR) was forfeited to the Federal Government. The oil thieves ran into trouble when their ship was intercepted by NNS DELTA on 25 April, 2017. They were illegally loading crude oil at Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), Afremo ‘A’ Terminal, South East of Escravos in Burutu Local Government Area of Delta State. The crew members connived with Azeberi (1st defendant); Peter Ala and David Ogoma aka Ambassador, both still at large, to siphon about 1905.836 cubic litres. The ship had no clearance from Nigerian maritime agencies. Also, all the foreigners on board had no valid documents to enter the country. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-856033 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201123_125526-2-592x1024.jpg" alt="" width="592" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201123_125526-2-592x1024.jpg 592w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201123_125526-2-173x300.jpg 173w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201123_125526-2.jpg 732w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px">

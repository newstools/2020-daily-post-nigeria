The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) on Tuesday allayed fears of petrol scarcity. Nigerians are stocking up amid the nationwide strike by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association (PENGASSAN). The oil workers and the federal government are at loggerheads over implementation of the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS). Kennie Obateru, NNPC spokesman, in a statement, assured that the industrial action would not lead to non-availability of petroleum products at fuel stations and depots. He quoted the Group Managing Director, Mele Kyari, as saying over 2.9 billion litres of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) are in stock. Kyari said this would guarantee seamless movement of people, goods and services ahead of the yuletide and beyond. The NNPC GMD reiterated that the corporation is determined to make the 2020 end-of-year festivities a zero fuel queue period just like 2019. Kyari disclosed that stockholders such as tanker drivers, depot owners and road transport owners have been mobilized to ensure hitch-free season.

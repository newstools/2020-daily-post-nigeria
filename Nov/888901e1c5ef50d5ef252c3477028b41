National Assembly members from Ebonyi State, elected on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), have said they will not be defecting to the APC. The PDP caucus in the National Assembly was reacting to the defection of Governor Dave Umahi. On Tuesday, the Chairman of South-East Governors Forum announced he was joining the All Progressive Congress (APC). Umahi based his decision on “marginalization” of Igbos by the PDP. He said by now, the party should have categorically stated whether or not it would zone its 2023 presidential ticket to the South-East. The governor added that there will be a mass exodus of leaders and members from PDP to APC in the region. But on Wednesday, the federal lawmakers from Ebonyi stated that no member of the caucus is decamping. Their leader and former Governor, Senator Sam Egwu, declared that the three Senators and five House of Representatives members remain in the PDP. “Ebonyi governor is on his own on this matter and is the only person going to another party”, he said.

Arsenal transfer target, Houssem Aouar, has been punished by Lyon after refusing to take part in a warm-down session, according to L’Equipe. The Gunners tried several time to sign the 22-year-old in the summer, but were unable to agree a deal with the Ligue 1 side, who were demanding a €60million (£55.5m) transfer fee. Aouar ended up staying in France and insisted that he was not unhappy that a move away from Lyon failed to materialise. However, it is understood his relationship with the club’s hierarchy is now under strain following a clash with coaching staff at the weekend. Aouar was furious after he was left on the bench in Lyon’s 1-0 victory over Angers on Sunday. The midfielder reportedly refused to take part in a post-match warm-down session with the rest of the unused substitutes, which is standard protocol for players who do not feature in the game. Aouar blamed the poor state of the pitch for not taking part in the post-match fitness drills. Lyon’s coaching staff are said to be “annoyed” with Aouar’s decision, especially as the squad were given a day off on Monday. The club’s sporting director, Juninho, has subsequently decided to drop the 22-year-old from the squad for the team’s Ligue 1 fixture against Reims on Sunday.

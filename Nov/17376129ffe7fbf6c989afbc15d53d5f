The gaffer has made it very known how big of a game it is. “All of us boys know how big of a game it is and we’re going into the game with the confidence that we want to win. “And that’s what we’ve been doing recently and we’re not going to change. “Obviously, we know how big of a game it is and how tough it’s going to be ‘But we’re ready, we’re confident and we’re ready to fight.” Chelsea sit in third place, two points behind Jose Mourinho’s men.

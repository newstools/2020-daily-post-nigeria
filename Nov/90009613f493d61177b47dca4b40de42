The All Progressives Congress (APC) says the defection of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftains to its platform is not surprising. Yekini Nabena, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, said this in a statement on Thursday. The spokesman noted that the reason was because APC was accommodating and runs the party fairly. Nabena said progressive-minded members in the PDP are leaving due to its failure to act like the main opposition. The official accused PDP of pushing Nigeria into a largely one-party state. He said the APC believes in democracy and progressive politics. “We, therefore, challenge other opposition political parties to take the place of the PDP because even as the governing party, we recognize the importance of rigorous and intelligent interrogation of our policies and programmes by the opposition which the PDP has woefully failed to do.” Nabena cited the defection of Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi and Senator representing Adamawa North Senatorial District, Elisha Abbo. This, he added, was is in addition to earlier return of former PDP national chairman, Senator Barnabas Gemade, former House of Representatives Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, Alex Otti, among others. “As a party, the APC welcomes new and returning entrants who have come to work with the President Muhammadu Buhari APC-led administration to improve the lives of Nigerians and overall better our dear country.” The statement hailed the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) led by Yobe Governor, Mai Mala Buni, for recognizing all interests and ensuring peace, unity, equity, justice and inclusion and internal democracy.

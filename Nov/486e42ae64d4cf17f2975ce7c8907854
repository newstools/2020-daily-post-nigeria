Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest update on Christian Pulisic and Kai Havertz ahead of his side’s Premier League clash against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday evening. Lampard said that Pulisic is ready to feature against Tottenham, while Havertz is also in a pretty good shape to play against Jose Mourinho’s side. Pulisic missed Chelsea’s Champions League 2-1 victory against Rennes on Tuesday due to lack of match fitness, while Havertz sustained an injury during the encounter against the French Ligue 1 side. Providing an update on the players, Lampard said at his pre-match press conference on Friday, “Christian Pulisic is back in contention for the game [against Tottenham] after working on his fitness. “Whether Christian is ready to start is another question, as it’s hard to gauge match fitness when you have only been training, but he is ready, and he is in contention.” Lampard added: “Kai Havertz played some minutes against Rennes the other day following his time out and it is more just checking on his potential for match fitness, but overall we are in pretty good shape.” The kick-off time for the game is 5:30 pm at Stamford Bridge.

Nigerian singer Oluwatosin Ajibade, also known as “Mr Eazi” has revealed why his relationship with Teni Otedola, daughter to Nigerian business mogul, Femi Otedola is still waxing strong against all odds. The couple had been in the news after they made their relationship public. However, people have been wondering how he was able to capture the heart of a billionaire’s daughter regardless of the difference in their social status. Speaking during an interview with Do2dtun of Cool FM, Eazi said that the synergy and closure in his relationship came from being responsible to his partner. According to him, being that way to her also made him a better person. “I think any form of responsibility helps us as human beings. “When you are responsible to someone; a friend, a girlfriend, a brother, a wife, helps you, especially because I am nomadic,” he said.

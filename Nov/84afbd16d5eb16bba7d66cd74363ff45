He said the challenges facing Nigeria’s University system has no doubt affected teaching, learning and quality of education. “It is indeed very worrisome to note with great concern, the exponential rise in travel for education abroad,” he said. “These challenges had crippled the system that it’s gradually losing its heroic pasts,” he added. “It is gratifying to note that this event is holding at this crucial period when our University Education system is undergoing some critical changes, certainly no better time than now,” he said. The former Vice President said he is aware of efforts by the Conference of Alumni Associations of Nigeria Universities (CAANU) as the umbrella body of Alumni Associations in Nigerian Universities to seek a formidable relationship with Association of Commonwealth Universities, National Universities Commission, TETFUND. He lamented that Nigerian students have continued to suffer, especially now that the Academic Staff Unions of Universities (ASUU), embarked on another strike, which has paralyzed academic activities for almost eight months. “It is gratifying to note the offer made by the Federal Government to members of ASUU, though not exhaustively meeting the demands of the union but certainly it is a bold step towards resolving the lingering crises in our University education,” he said. Namadi urged the conference to consider the establishment of an endowment fund in their respective institutions to augment funding for research and critical infrastructure in the universities.

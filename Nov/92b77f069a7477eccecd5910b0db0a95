Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he now has the players to execute any tactical plan. United host Arsenal today in the Premier League, looking to record their first win at home this season. During the 5-0 victory over RB Leipzig in the Champions League on Wednesday, Solskjaer started with Donny van der Beek at the head of a diamond. “I think last season we put a lot of work into our principles and the way we want to play, and we had a foundation to play it from with two central midfielders. “This season we’ve added quality in the squad with Edinson Cavani, Donny and Alex Telles. “Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford are now back fit so we have more options and we have more options tactically. “If we want to play a 4-3-3, a diamond, a 3-4-3 or 3-5-2, I think we have more options than ever before,” Solskjaer said.

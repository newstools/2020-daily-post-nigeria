Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has left Lionel Messi out of his squad for their trip to Dynamo Kiev on Tuesday night. Messi has not been included in the final 19-man squad ahead of the Blaugrana’s latest Champions League outing in Ukraine. The 33-year-old played all 90 minutes, as Barca lost 1-0 at Atletico Madrid in LaLiga last weekend. Frenkie de Jong has also been omitted from the squad. But Koeman has insisted he is resting the two players. Koeman, speaking during his Monday press conference, said: “They need to take some rest and after the good performances in UCL it is a good time for them to rest.”

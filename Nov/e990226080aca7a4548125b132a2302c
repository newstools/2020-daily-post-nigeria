Spain captain, Sergio Ramos, has urged his team to ‘reset’ for a victory when they tackle Germany in the UEFA Nations League tie in Seville on Tuesday. Ramos said this while reacting to Spain’s 1-1 draw with Switzerland in the Nations League on Saturday. The Real Madrid centre-back missed two penalties as Spain needed a late equaliser from Gerard Moreno to draw 1-1 with Switzerland. The 34-year-old had previously scored 25 penalties in a row, and his inaccuracy from the spot against Switzerland cost Spain, who will now have to beat Germany in Sevilla to reach the final four. “A very fought point. We reset for the victory in Seville,” Ramos wrote on his Twitter handle after the game. “We are not defined by our mistakes, but by how we approach the following goals.” Meanwhile, speaking after the game, Spain coach, Luis Enrique, defended Ramos. “Sergio’s numbers for penalties are out of this world,” Enrique said. “If there had been a third penalty, he would have taken that one as well,” he added.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has claimed his players were not happy in the dressing room, following their 0-0 draw with Chelsea on Sunday. Mourinho’s men came into the game at Stamford Bridge looking to go top with three points, after Liverpool’s 1-1 draw at Brighton on Saturday. Spurs indeed went top with one point. But Mourinho, speaking to Sky Sports after the game, said his team was not delighted. “My dressing room is not happy and that is the best thing to take from the game. “We are not happy and for me that is fantastic, it is a change of mentality,” Mourinho said. He however admitted that “it is a game where we respect them and they respect us. No one gambled.”

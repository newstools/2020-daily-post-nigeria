The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Akwa Ibom Sector has said it recorded 72 road crashes and 16 deaths from January to October. The Akwa Ibom Sector Commander, Mr Oga Ochi, gave the figure in his remarks during the commemoration ceremony of the World Day of Remembrance for Victims of Road Traffic Crashes held in Uyo on Friday. Ochi said that during the period, no fewer than 93 persons were injured in the 72 crashes in the state. “It is good to note that from January to October 2020, the state recorded a total of 72 road crashes, 16 fatalities and 93 persons injured. “This figure even though low when compared to other states of the federation, cannot be an acceptable norm. “All hands must be on deck to enable us record zero road traffic crashes in the state,” he said. The sector commander assured that the FRSC would continue to work with strategic stakeholders to pursue public enlightenment programmes and aggressive enforcement of traffic rules to serve as a deterrent to traffic violators. He, however, urged members of the public to remember the plight of families, friends of victims of road crashes and avoid infractions that undermine safety.

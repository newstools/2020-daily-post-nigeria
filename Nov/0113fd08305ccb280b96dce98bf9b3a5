Sierra Leone coach, John Keister, has insisted that his team are now under pressure to beat Super Eagles in today’s second leg Group L match-day four 2022 AFCON qualifier tie because of the result they achieved in Nigeria. Sierra Leone made a shock comeback by cancelling a 4-0 deficit to draw 4-4 against Gernot Rohr’s side in the reverse fixture in Benin City, Edo State last Friday. Keister said Sierra Leone will now have to prove in Freetown that the draw against Nigeria in the first leg tie was not a fluke. “We are looking forward to it,” Keister told Aclsports. “We are now under pressure because of the result we achieved in Nigeria, and the onus is on us to prove it is not a fluke. “I think we gave them a lot of respect at the start, that’s why we conceded four goals when we came out bolder, we scored ours. Now we have to come out and play on our home turf,” he said. A victory for the Leone Stars on Tuesday will take them to five points and just two points behind the Super Eagles who top Group L.

An Owerri Magistrate Court, on Monday, remanded Hercules Okoro representing Ohaji Egbema State Constituency in the Imo House of Assembly, in the state correctional facility for alleged assault. Okoro, a member of the All Progressives Congress, (APC), was arraigned in court for an 8-count charge bordering on alleged assault with intent to wound. He, however, pleaded not guilty to all the charges levelled against him. However, Mr. Amandibuogu Osondu, the counsel to the defendant, argued that the offence was bailable, insisting that Okoroâ€™s continued detention was against justice. Osondu pleaded for bail since the defendant had been detained for three days. Responding, Mr. T Okee, the prosecuting counsel, said the case was sudden adding that he needed more time. In his ruling, Justice DV Okoroji advised the prosecuting and the defending counsels to exchange briefs on Tuesday and adjourned till Nov. 18. NAN reports that Okoro was arrested last Friday following a violent altercation between him and Amarachi Iwuanyanwu (APC Nwangele), the Deputy Speaker of the House.

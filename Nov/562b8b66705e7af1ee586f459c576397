Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari to engage the services of foreign mercenaries in flushing out Boko Haram from Nigeria. Zulum made the appeal while receiving a federal government’s delegation who where in the state to sympathise with them over the massacre of some rice farmers in Jere Local Government Area. He urged the Buhari-led government to take more serious measures towards bringing an end to the issue of insurgency. Zulum also made some recommendations to the federal government on how to put an end to the problem of insurgency. He said: “One of our recommendations as possible solutions to end the insurgency is the immediate recruitment of our youths into military and paramilitary services to complement the efforts of the Nigerian forces. “Our second recommendation is to engage the services of our immediate neighbours, especially the government of Chad, Cameroon and Niger Republic, in clearing the remnants of Boko Haram hiding in the shores of the Lake Chad. “Our third recommendation is for him to engage the services of the mercenaries to clear the entire Sambisa forest. “Our fourth recommendation is for him to provide the police and the military, with armed resistant armoured personnel carriers and other related equipment.”

Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, has reacted to the emergence of Joe Biden as the 46th president of the United States, US. Fani-Kayode wished Biden well in his new endeavours as president of the US. He, however, noted that the election may be overturned in favour of the outgoing President, Donald Trump. In a tweet, the former minister wrote: “As expected the Int. News Networks including @CNN, @cnni have declared @JoeBiden the winner of the election. “Let us see what the Supreme Court will say. If the election is not overturned I wish Joe well. “If it is overturned I wish @realDonaldTrump well. Let us see where it ends!” Also, Festus Keyamo, Minister of Labour and Employment, congratulated Biden on his victory at the just concluded election. Keyamo also congratulated the Vice President-elect, Kamala Harris. In a tweet, the minister said Harris’ emergence as Vice President should be replicated in Nigeria so women can occupy high positions. He expressed hope that women would one day become president in Nigeria. He wrote: “Congrats to Joseph Robinette Biden Jr, on being elected the 46th President of the USA and also to Kamala Harris, first woman of colour elected as VP. “The time has also come to give our women the chance to occupy such a high office in our country and even the number one position.” Biden, who is the candidate of the Democrat, had defeated the outgoing President, Donald Trump after polling the highest number of votes.

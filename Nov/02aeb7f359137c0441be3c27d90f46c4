The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) has told the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) to publicly condemn the actions of pastors and church leaders. NSCIA accused some clerics of inciting their followers against Muslims in the country. The body is led by the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar III. In a statement on Thursday, NSCIA Head of Communication, Ibrahim Aselemi, noted that some pastors hide under the rights to free speech to spread anti-Muslim messages. Aselemi also accused CAN leadership of paying lip service to religious harmony and tolerance. “The persistent anti-Islamic rhetoric whipped up by some clergymen of the Christian faith in recent times in Nigeria is most worrisome and has become a source of grave concern. “These Church leaders have developed a penchant for inciting Christians against Muslims in every time the opportunity presents itself while hiding under the umbrella of free speech and religious freedom.” NSCIA stressed that the silence of CAN means complicit. The statement said this was disappointing, double standard, self-indicting and morally unconscionable. The Islamic leaders added that they await the outcome of the police investigation and prosecution of those found culpable of instigating violence. Aselemi appealed to Muslims in the South-East and other regions not to take laws into their hands and continue to be law-abiding.

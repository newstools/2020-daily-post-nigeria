The Niger-Delta Development Commission, NDDC says as part of its on-going Forensic Audit, lead consultants will tomorrow take over all original contract files relating to projects and programmes awarded by the NDDC between 2001 and 2019. The NDDC says the move is as directed by President Muhammadu Buhari. Director of Corporate Affairs at the NDDC, Charles Odili in a statement said the takeover of the contract files by the Forensic Auditors will mark the commencement of the next stage of the exercise which started with the handover of contract documents covering projects captured during the verification exercise in April 2020. Odili said the forensic audit is being carried out in phases and that the Commission is now ready to kick-off the Field Forensic Audit. He added that “to ensure the success of the exercise, the NDDC is making available all required documents needed by the field auditors to discharge their duties efficiently and effectively. “The NDDC management will meet with the forensic auditors to formally release the files which have been sorted in 16 lots as segmented for the forensic exercise. “We wish to inform the public that all contract files are no longer in the office of the Acting Executive Director Projects, as they are now in the custody of the auditors.”

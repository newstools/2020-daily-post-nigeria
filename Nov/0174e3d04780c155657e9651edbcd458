In his welcome address, the Executive Director of ISN Products Nigeria Limited, Mr. Felix Ofungwu, noted that the award was part of efforts by the company to contribute its quota in promoting and rewarding excellence among medical laboratory scientists for their active role in the health sector. According to Ofungwu, the place of medical laboratory scientists in the health care sector could not have been more significant given their contribution to saving lives amidst the rampaging effect of COVID-19 in Nigeria. “For us at ISN, we believe that proper and adequate care is only as good as the accuracy of the diagnosis that the patient receives and the responsibility of that diagnosis is largely borne by the medical laboratory scientists,” he added. In his goodwill message, the President, Medical Laboratory Science Council of Nigeria (MLSCN), Mr. Tosan Erhabor equally lauded the company for leading the charge to celebrate the unsung heroes of the health sector through this initiative. “The vision of ISN is in tandem with what MLSCN stands for and the reward for the award itself lends credence to the company’s commitment to quality laboratory service in Nigeria. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-856868 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ISN-3-1024x683.jpeg" alt="" width="740" height="494" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ISN-3-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ISN-3-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ISN-3.jpeg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"> Speaking shortly after being announced the winner of the maiden edition of the award, Fashina applauded the management of the company for its commitment to quality medical science practice which, he said has been demonstrated through the recognition given to practitioners via the initiative.

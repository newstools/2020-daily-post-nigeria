Enugu State Commissioner for Health, Dr Ikechukwu Obi, says about 15 per cent of people bitten by mosquitoes are bound to be infected with yellow fever. He spoke on Saturday during the fumigation and vaccination exercise against yellow fever in two affected communities. They are Ette-Uno and Umuopu, both in Igboeze North Local Government Area, NAN reports. Obi advised mothers to ensure complete rounds of immunisation of their children. He said this must include yellow fever vaccination in the ninth month of birth. Enugu State Fire Officer, Okwudili Ohaa, led the disinfection exercise. Chairman of the LGA, Ejike Itodo, appealed to the public to abide by Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) protocols to forestall epidemics.

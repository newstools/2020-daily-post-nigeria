The Prelate of Christ Victorious Alive Revival Mission, Owerri, Bishop Uzoma Emmanuel has charged the Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma to ensure that the former Governor of the state, Owelle Rochas Okorocha gives account of his stewardship within the eight years he served as the Governor. The cleric who described the eight years of the former Governor as a disaster to Imo people, said it will set a wrong precedence if he (Rochas Okorocha) is left to go scot-free. “The eight years rule of the former Governor of Imo State did not make much impact in the political and economic development of the state. “It was one the people would wish never happened. I urge the government of Senator Hope Uzodinma to summon the former Governor to give account of his stewardship,” he said. In the same vein, the clergy advised the former Governor to jettison his 2023 Presidential ambition. He suggested he should rather concentrate on how to achieve a second term bid to the senate House. He further opined that Igbo presidency will be achievable only if the people will come together in one voice, regretting that Igbos are not united.

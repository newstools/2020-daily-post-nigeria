Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, will have Alex Telles available for selection ahead of their trip to Everton. Telles has only played once for the Red Devils, since signing on transfer deadline day after testing positive for COVID-19. His availability gives Solskjaer the options to either rest Luke Shaw or play the English defender as a centre-half in a back three. Anthony Martial returns to play in the Premier League having been suspended for the last three matches. The Frenchman was given a straight red for elbowing Erik Lamela in the damning 6-1 defeat to Tottenham. According to MEN, Mason Greenwood is not at the hotel, but he may link up with the squad at a later point. Man Utd squad

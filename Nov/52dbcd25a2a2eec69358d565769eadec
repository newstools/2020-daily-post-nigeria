Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has ‘brainwashed’ his players into thinking they can be Premier League champions, according to Tim Sherwood. Sherwood played for Spurs between 1999 and 2003. The north London club is top of the Premier League after nine rounds of fixtures. Mourinho’s men have not lost in the league since their opening weekend defeat to Everton in September. “Jose has brainwashed his players to believe they have to work to achieve something. “And why wouldn’t you believe in him? He’s won 20 major trophies in his career. “When we’ve got players like Son [Heung-Min] and [Harry] Kane, who are world-class and could probably play in any team in the world, you’ve always got a chance,” Sherwood told talkSPORT. Mourinho won three Premier League titles with Chelsea, the same number Tottenham have won in 29 years.

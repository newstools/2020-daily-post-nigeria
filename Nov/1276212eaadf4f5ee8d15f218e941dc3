Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford, has said penalty takers would continue to change after he took a spot-kick ahead of Bruno Fernandes this week. Fernandes passed up the chance to score a first-half hat-trick in the 4-1 win over Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League on Tuesday evening. In a previous Champions League fixture against RB Leipzig last month, Rashford allowed Anthony Martial to take a penalty ahead of him. Rashford has now explained he is keen for players in the squad to keep scoring in order to keep confidence high. “There was a similar situation during the Leipzig game when I could have got my first career hat-trick,” Rashford told Stretty News. “As a striker your confidence comes from scoring goals consistently and for that reason it was important Tony [Martial] had the opportunity to get on the scoresheet. “Thankfully I got the hat-trick and we got a fantastic result against a very tough team but what was important at the time was that the team felt good, confident and motivated to push on with the upcoming run of fixtures. “It’s a really busy time and we all play a role in the team’s success.”

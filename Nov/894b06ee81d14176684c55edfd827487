Former England striker, Michael Owen, has said the Premier League clash between Manchester United and Arsenal on Sunday, will end in a draw. United host the Gunners, with both sides looking to pull themselves out of the bottom half of the table. Arsenal have lost their last two league fixtures to Manchester City and Leicester, while the Red Devils played out a 0-0 draw with Chelsea last weekend. But both teams returned to winning ways in Europe last midweek, with United thumping RB Leipzig 5-0 in the Champions League and Arsenal beating Dundalk 3-0 in the Europa League. Owen told BetVictor: “Arsenal’s early season rise has been dampened slightly with recent results. They will be looking at this as the perfect platform to get going again. “United themselves have picked up. Marcus Rashford is really starting to fire and he could be United’s danger man here. “However, I think if Arsenal can keep him quiet, they could come away with a point.”

Governor, Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has vowed that nobody can rename any part of the state. The Governor said this while making veiled reference to the activities of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) in the state. Wike spoke on Friday at the Government House in Port Harcourt when he played host to a delegation of Tiv people living in Rivers State under the aegis of Mdzough U. Tiv led by Mr. Caleb Yashi. The Governor called on Tiv people to continue to live peacefully with people of their host communities. Wike noted that the Tivs have not caused any trouble in Rivers State even though they are warriors, and very strong. “Rivers State is a place that is very accommodating. We accept everybody to stay with us peacefully. It is only those who want to rename Rivers State that I have said, I will not agree. “Nobody can rename Rivers State. As per living peacefully, we have good relationship with all ethnic nationalities that live in Rivers State.”

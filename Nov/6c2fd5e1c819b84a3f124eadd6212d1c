President Muhammadu Buhari, on Tuesday, said that his nephew, Mallam Mamman Daura, is widely misunderstood by some Nigerians. He said this while felicitating with Daura on the occasion of his 81st birthday. Buhari described Daura as one of Nigeria’s worthiest gentleman, dedicated public servant and a consummate administrator, This was contained in a statement signed by Garba Shehu, his Spokesman, and made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday. Buhari said Daura is a thoroughbred public administrator with an all rounded knowledge and experience in life and government. The President noted that “among Daura’s unappreciated virtues are his humility, compassion and zeal to provide mentoring to many who are privileged to be with him or close to him.” Buhari said that Daura is needlessly misunderstood by many, adding that this is unusual “because many great men are not appreciated, which stems from the cynical obsession of many of his critics.” Buhari called on Nigerians to apply fairness in their assessment of public figures like Daura, according to him, whose contributions to the development of Nigeria overshadow perceived flaws. According to Buhari, Daura is a fountain of inspiration and an inexhaustible reservoir of knowledge.

The State Department is ready to work with Joe Biden on transition. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo confirmed this in an interview on Fox News. The United States top diplomat assured that the State Department would respect the Trump administration’s “promise” to begin shift. “Those things that are required that the President has directed us to do in compliance with the decision that the GSA made yesterday, we’ll do all of those things. It’s a legal requirement, and we’ll always honor that promise,” Pompeo said. The General Services Administration is in charge of the process. The agency coordinates access to federal assets during transmutation from one administration to another. On Thursday, President Donald Trump hinted that he will leave the White House if the Electoral College affirm Biden’s win. The American leader has still not conceded to the former Vice President. The Democrat has won more than 80 million popular votes and 306 electoral votes.

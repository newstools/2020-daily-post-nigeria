Head coach of Nigeria’s Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has promised that his team would do everything possible to beat Sierra Leone in the return leg of the Group L 2021 AFCON qualifier tie in Freetown on Tuesday. Rohr’s men shockingly surrendered a four-goal lead to draw 4-4 against Sierra Leone in Benin on Friday evening. Rohr now believes that the Super Eagles will react to make amends because he knows what his players can do. “Everybody is determined, everybody is vexed, nobody slept,” Rohr said in an interview published on the Super Eagles YouTube channel on Saturday. “So we are doing everything in training, and in the meeting, we will do, we will see everything again in the video, speak about the mistakes and I’m sure they will react because I know my team, I know what we can do, they showed it in the first half. “If we can maintain the energy for the second half we can do it I know it’s a good team. I think at half-time they believed it’s finished, but it was not finished. “It is a good lesson to everybody, to the staff, to the players and we have to react, I can promise you that we will react, if they will be lucky or not I cannot promise you, but they will fight and go there to win the match,” he said.

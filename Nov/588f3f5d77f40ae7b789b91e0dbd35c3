The Air Component of Operation Hadarin Daji has neutralised 17 bandits and destroyed their camp in the Dunya Forest area of Katsina State. Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, made this known in a statement on Friday. He said the airstrikes were executed on Thursday following credible intelligence on the presence of the elements. The spokesman noted that the intelligence and surveillance missions revealed that dozens of bandits linked to Ansaru terrorist group had established a camp at the location. They also kept scores of rustled cattle in the forest. Enenche disclosed that Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets and helicopter gunships were dispatched and engaged the bandits. The air attacks destroyed portions of the camp, including their storage facility, which was seen engulfed in flames. “Human intelligence sources later confirmed that no fewer than 17 bandits were neutralised and several others injured”, the statement added. The Military High Command commended troops and other security agencies operating in the North-West and urged them to remain resolute in order to eradicate all armed bandits.

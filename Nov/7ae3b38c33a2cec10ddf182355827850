Barcelona has confirmed that Gerard Pique has suffered medial and cruciate knee ligament injuries. Pique was taken off after colliding with Atletico Madrid’s Angel Correa during a LaLiga game on Saturday. After receiving treatment, the defender left the field in tears. “Evidence shows that Pique has a grade three sprain of the medial-lateral ligament and a partial injury to the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. Evolution will determine future availability,” a statement from the club read on Sunday. Barca also confirmed Sergi Roberto is facing two months on the sidelines with a thigh injury. “Tests performed this Sunday on Sergi Roberto have shown that he has a rupture in the femoral rectus of his right thigh. The approximate time he will be out is two months,” the statement added.

Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has urged the American people to see President Donald Trump as a blessing from God. Addressing his members on Sunday on a topic, tagged” Living in Darkness”, the cleric alleged that those who failed to control the world through coronavirus are working very hard to send Donald Trump out of the White House. According to Giwa, without God’s appointed time, those trying to stand in our way shall achieve nothing. The pastor specifically described the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden as incompetent, saying,” I don’t see Joe Biden as a proactive leader who can stand against disgruntled elements. “Those who failed to control the world through coronavirus are working tirelessly to push president Trump out of the White house. “If the Lord does not build the house, the builders will labor in vain. God’s timing is perfect and without it, nothing can be achieved. “The forces of darkness are working round the clock to ensure that they give Americans a president they can control with a view to achieving their goals.” “The will of God shall prevail; if it is the will of God there is nothing anyone can do.”

The House of Representatives committee on IDPs and Refugees on Tuesday stepped down budget defence by the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development over vague details of COVID19 palliatives. Hajiya Sadiyya Farouq, the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development was unable to convince the committee on the distribution of the palliatives. The Chairman of the Committee, Muhammed Jega, accused the minister of providing “vague description of the line item.” “Details of food palliatives from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Nigerian Customs Service could not be found in the presentation,” Jega said. The committee resolved that the minister should come back to present proper document.

Singer, Simi has blasted Nigerian leaders over the continued strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. ASUU has been on strike since March as the government and union failed to reach an argument. The inability of the government and ASUU to reach an agreement has continued to hinder students from returning to their respective institutions, being mostly on the receiving end. Simi took to her Twitter account to express frustrations over the plight of average Nigerian and called out Nigerian leaders over the prolonged ASUU strike. According to her, the government is not concerned about the dreams and future of youths in Nigerian universities. Her tweet read: “Higher institutions on strike for months almost, if not every, year. The odds are always stacked against the average Nigerian. You spend the first half of your life just trying to survive. “Taking away the hopes and dreams of the youth. Destroying their futures so they’re ready to settle for crumbs. Just so they can live to see the next day and fight for more crumbs. Because they’re not your own children, their futures don’t matter? Shame on you! “If the leaders in our own country cannot have compassion on their own people, then what can we really do? They get into power and abuse it, abuse the people they should be serving. “ Taking a swipe at the government, Simi said: “The rest of the world laughing at the so-called giant of Africa. Shame on all of you!! “Imagine doing a four-year course for eight years but still no job. This wickedness is too much. —

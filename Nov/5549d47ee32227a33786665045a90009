The Argentine Football Association expressed its deepest sorrow for the death of the legend. “You will always be in our hearts”, the FA added. Alberto Fernandez, the President of Argentina has declared a three-day mourning period. “You took us to the top of the world. You made us immensely happy. You were the greatest of them all. Thank you for having existed, Diego. We’re going to miss you all our lives”, he said. Maradona played for Barcelona and Napoli. He scored 34 goals in 91 appearances for Argentina, and featured in four World Cups. Maradona was captain when his country won the 1986 World Cup.

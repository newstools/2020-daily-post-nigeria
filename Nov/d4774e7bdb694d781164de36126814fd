The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State has given Okpoku Ogenyi a 24-hour ultimatum to withdraw his allegations against the national leadership. Abba Yaro, APC state chairman gave the warning in a statement on Saturday. The party said failure to apologize to the Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee will bring about his sanction. Former National Secretary and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni, is the head of the team. At a press briefing on Friday, Ogenyi alleged that Mai and others were planning to elongate their tenure. NAN reports that Ogenyi, on behalf of ‘Concerned APC Members Forum’, also accused the committee of going out of its mandate. He condemned the fresh membership registration, noting that what party members expect is a timetable for national convention to elect a new National Working Committee (NWC). But Yaro called him an “impostor and a hired fifth columnist”. The chairman advised APC members nationwide to ignore Ogenyi and the forum. He insisted that the planned membership registration, update, revalidation, and reconciliation efforts were part of the committee’s tasks. “All identified stakeholders led by President Muhammadu Buhari as leader of our party, the Progressives Governors Forum, state chapters, National Assembly leadership are regularly consulted and carried along on all decisions by the committee. “Okpoku Ogenyi is strongly advised to withdraw within 24 hours his baseless allegations which he made in a television interview on Friday or face disciplinary actions. He should tender apology to the caretaker committee over his tactless and ill motivated attempt to bring the party to disrepute,” Yaro said.

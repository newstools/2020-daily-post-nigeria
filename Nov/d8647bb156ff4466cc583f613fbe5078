The Lagos State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Sunday, called for the resignation of the state Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu. The state arm of the party said Sanwo-Olu has lost the confidence of the people, hence should vacate office. Taofik Gani, the Publicity Secretary of the party in the state, explained that the people of the state no longer trust Sanwo-Olu, following the use of soldiers against peaceful End SARS protesters at Lekki toll gate in the state. He said, “The PDP is of the view that it is more expedient for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to step aside now that the Nigerian Army has revealed him as the person who invited the soldiers to go quell the Lekki protests which have led to unfortunate fatalities and grievous injuries. “Obviously, Lagosians can no longer trust a governor who denies his conspiracy actions in government. Sanwoolu has no moral standing worth being proud of and he should admit this and honourably leave the stage as governor of the state.” Recall that soldiers were accused of killing peaceful protesters at the Lekki toll gate. However, the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army had refused claims that soldiers shot and killed protesters at the Lekki toll gate. The Division also soldiers had stormed the Lekki toll gate following an invitation by Sanwo-Olu to intervene in the crisis caused by hoodlums who hijacked the protest.

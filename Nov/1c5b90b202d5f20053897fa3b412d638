The leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu has called out the Nigerian government after the resignation of Peru president, Manuel Merino following street protests. Merino resigned after the death of two protesters among the tens of thousands who were protesting against the government in Lima, the capital city. Police had fired tear gas and shotgun pellets to repel demonstrators who threw objects. Reacting, the IPOB leader took a swipe at the Nigerian government over its treatment of protesters and response to End SARS protests. Kanu on his Twitter page wrote: “Peru President Merino resigns following street protests but in Nigeria, following #EndSARS protests, Nigeria president is either persecuting and freezing bank accounts of Nigerian youths or slaughtering them at #Obigbo and Nigerians are seemingly tolerating it. “ Recall that some accounts belonging to End SARS promoters were recently blocked by the central Bank of Nigeria. About six protesters were recently granted bail by an Abuja court after they were arrested during a protest in Abuja. This was following the End SARS protest led by Nigerians against police brutality in the country.

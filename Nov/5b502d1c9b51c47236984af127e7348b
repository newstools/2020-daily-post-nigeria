An Ile-Tuntun Customary Court in Ibadan, on Tuesday, dissolved a four-year-old marriage between Azeez Busari, a marabout, and his wife, Kaosara. Busari complained that the spouse caused him anguish through repeated violent acts at home. “I probably would not have been in this mess if I heeded the earlier warning signs. Kaosara is a devil. She was planning to kill my father”, NAN quoted him as saying. He recalled that Kaosara destroyed his furniture with a cutlass and challenged him to a fight. But the defendant denied the allegations, declaring that her husband was a womanizer. Kaosara told the court that before their marriage, Busari lied that he had one wife. “His first wife soon informed me that I was the sixth wife and that he sent four of them packing. Azeez married two more after me. He charmed all the women who left such that no man would ever woo them.” Henry Agbaje, President of the court said it was better to end the union before bloodshed happens. The arbitrator awarded custody of the only child to Kaosara. Busari was ordered to pay N5,000 monthly feeding allowance to them. Agbaje advised men and women intending to marry to properly study their partners before settling down.

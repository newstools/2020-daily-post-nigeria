Popular singer, Justin Bieber has reacted to being nominated in ‘pop’ categories at the 2020 Grammys. Bieber picked four nomination this year for Best Pop album, Best Pop solo performance, Best Country duo performance and Best Pop group performance. But, Bieber expressed dissatisfaction at the nomination category, stating that his album was set out to be R&B not Pop. On his Instagram page, Bieber wrote: “To the Grammys, I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out I set out to make an R&B album. Changes is an R&B album. It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me.” Bieber, however, expressed gratitude to the Grammys organisers for nominations and respecting his music. His post added: “Please don’t mistake this as me being ungrateful, these are just my thoughts take em or leave em.”<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856288" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="1241" height="1391" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-1-1.jpg 1241w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-1-1-268x300.jpg 268w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-1-1-914x1024.jpg 914w" sizes="(max-width: 1241px) 100vw, 1241px">

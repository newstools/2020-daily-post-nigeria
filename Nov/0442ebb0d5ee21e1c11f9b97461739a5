Monaco midfielder, Cesc Fabregas, has said he considers his former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho a friend, but admitted he has no relationship with ex-Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola. The 33-year-old played only one season under Guardiola at the Camp Nou, before the manager left in 2012 to take a sabbatical. “No, no, with Pep nothing at all. I don’t know if the disappointment with Pep is mutual. “Things happened, but I prefer not to talk about it,” Fabregas told Radio Cataluna. Fabregas however still remains in contact with Mourinho, who is now at Tottenham Hotspur. The Spaniard played under Mourinho for 19 months at Stamford Bridge, before the manager was sacked in December 2015. “Mourinho inspired me the most when I left Barca. He told me that we had had our issues when he was at Chelsea and I was at Arsenal. And when he was coaching at Real Madrid and I was at Barcelona. But that for him, it all ended there. We turned the page,” Fabregas said. Fabregas won the Copa del Rey under Guardiola and claimed the Carabao Cup and Premier League under Mourinho.

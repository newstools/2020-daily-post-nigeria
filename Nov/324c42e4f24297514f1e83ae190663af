Lagos State Government is to close the Railway Level Crossing at Ilupeju, Jibowu, Ogunmokun and Yaba for some days next week. This is in continuation of the Nigerian Railway Modernisation Project- Lagos-Ibadan section. The Ministry of Transportation, in a statement, said the closure of the Railway Level Crossing in Ilupeju is scheduled for Sunday, November 15. That of Ogunmokun is Monday, November 16, while Jibowu and Yaba will be closed Wednesday, November 18. The closure will be from 8:00pm to 7:00am each day. The construction works would focus on track stress dispersion and locking at various level crossing joints of the Standard Gauge Railway.

Motorists plying Ilupeju level crossing will be diverted to Ogunmokun, Yaba and Jibowu Crossing to access their desired destinations. Those who intend to use Ogunmokun road or access other areas from the route were advised to use Ilupeju crossing to Mushin, Oshodi and Surulere. The statement assured traffic management personnel will be available to reduce expected gridlock.

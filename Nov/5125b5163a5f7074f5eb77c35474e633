Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, was a surprise omission from Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s Champions League squad that played Istanbul Basaksehir at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. Pogba was also missing as the Red Devils beat West Brom 1-0 last weekend in the Premier League with an ankle strain. But he trained in the days leading up to the visit of Basaksehir. Solskjaer had hoped to have the France international fit and available given his reliance on Bruno Fernandes and Fred in recent weeks, but he failed to meet up with the squad at the Lowry Hotel on Tuesday. The United manager confirmed to MUTV before kick-off that the issue had flared up again. “His ankle is swollen up. He trained yesterday but didn’t feel right and this morning it was confirmation he couldn’t play,” Solskjaer said. United’s next game is away to Southampton on Sunday in the Premier League.

Popular Nigerian singer, Tiwa Savage has revealed that she got turned down by Banky W from being signed into his music label ‘EME.’ Tiwa said this during an interview with Ebuka Obi-Uchendu. Empire Mates Entertainment known as EME was a Nigerian record label founded by Banky W and Tunde Demuren in 2002. According to her, before she joined Mavin Records, she had approached Banky W alongside other record labels, but he refused. When asked why, Tiwa said Banky W had a female artist he was working with at the time. The mother of one said: “At the time when I just got back to Nigeria, I approached Banky W to sign me into his music label, but he said No. “I guess because he was about to work with Niniola at the time. I also went to Mohits at that time, and they were working with Muna, so they turned me down and I went back to LA. “But I later got back to Nigeria and begged Don Jazzy to sign me into Mavin records and he did. “I’m sure EME, other records can see me now,” Tiwa said.

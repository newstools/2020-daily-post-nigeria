The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, on Friday, sent a birthday message to former President, Dr Goodluck Jonathan on his 63rd birthday. Ortom, in a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Terver Akase, described
Jonathan as a ‘man of honour’. According to him, Jonathan is a true patriot who has made selfless contributions to the unity and development of Nigeria. Ortom noted that the former President’s role as ECOWAS envoy to Mali has further proven his reputation as a man who promotes peace. He, however, wished Jonathan a happy birthday celebration and prayed for God almighty to grant him many more years of good health.

Senator Opeyemi Bamidele, the chairman of the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, has said the Senate will open an investigation into the conviction of six Nigerians in the UAE for wiring $782,000 to Boko Haram. Bamidele, speaking with reporters on Monday, however, noted that the committee was unaware of the recent arrest and imprisonment of the six persons. However, the committee was ready to find out the true position of things. According to Bamidele, the Senate was working with the relevant committees of the House of Representatives on the amount earmarked for the prosecution of Boko Haram suspects. “These are some of the issues before us as a committee. “It’s not just the Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, the House Committee on Justice is also working with us on this matter,” he said.

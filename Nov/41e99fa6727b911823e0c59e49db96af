Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has asked a House of Representatives member, Hon. Segun Adekoya, to stop work on a road project he embarked on in his constituency. Adekoya is the lawmaker representing Ijebu-North/Ijebu-East/Ogun Waterside Federal Constituency. DAILY POST learnt that the lawmaker had embarked on the renovation of Igan road in Ago-Iwoye, an area under his constituency. But, the Ogun State Government, in a letter signed on Friday by the Special Adviser to Governor Abiodun on Works and Infrastructure, Engr Adesina Babatunde A., instructed the lawmaker to stop work on the road immediately for not obtaining approval before commencing work on it. The letter, which was addressed to Hon. Adekoya directly, was referenced, AD.1136/7 and titled: “ILLEGAL RECONSTRUCTION/REHABILITATION OF STATE ROADS.” The letter reads: “I am directed to apprise you that it has come to the knowledge of the Ogun State Government the illegal reconstruction/rehabilitation of Igan Road in Ago-Iwoye, which you have embarked upon without obtaining prior approval from the Ogun State Government, knowing fully well that the road is a state road. “As a result, you are hereby instructed to stop work immediately on the road and any other road. Also, you are enjoined to submit to the Ministry of Works and Infrastructure, your proposals for the reconstruction/rehabilitation work and wait for the state government’s approval before you commence or embark on any such mission.” Contacted, Hon. Adekoya confirmed the development to DAILY POST in a message. However, he confided in our correspondent that the letter had been withdrawn. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-856694" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201127-WA0032.jpg" alt="" width="780" height="1040" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201127-WA0032.jpg 780w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201127-WA0032-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201127-WA0032-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px">

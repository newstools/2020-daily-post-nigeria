Corey Lewandowski, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, has tested positive for COVID-19. Lewandowski confirmed his status in a text to CNBC on Thursday. He, however, added that he feels great despite testing positive. Lewandowski joins a growing list of individuals close to the President who have tested positive for coronavirus after attending campaign events before the US presidential election. David Bossie, one of the President’s political advisers, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, and White House political affairs director Brian Jack all tested positive for the virus this week, CNBC reports. Lewandowski was recently seen in Philadelphia, where the Trump campaign is challenging ‘vote irregularities’ in the US presidential election.

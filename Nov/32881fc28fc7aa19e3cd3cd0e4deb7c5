The Commissioner of Police in Lagos, Hakeem Odumosu, has warned officers and men of the Command against negligence, indolence and complacency. He gave the warning on Friday in a statement by Police Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi. Some policemen are yet to resume or have been working inadequately since the End SARS protests. Odumosu declared that dereliction of duty will no longer be condoned. The CP urged the personnel to rise up to the security challenges associated with ember months. Odumosu disclosed that he had read the riot act to those not performing their statutory obligation as expected. He said there was no excuse for any policeman to be absent in spite of the words of encouragement from the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. “Even the Governor of Lagos State, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu and well-meaning Nigerians, including our wives and mothers, the Police Officers Wives Association have encouraged officers to assume duty. We cannot handle the security of Lagos State with levity.” Odumosu ordered Area Commanders, District Police Officers and Heads of Department to henceforth book any policeman who failed to report to duty. He vowed that such operative will be dealt with according to the provisions of the Police Act and Regulations.

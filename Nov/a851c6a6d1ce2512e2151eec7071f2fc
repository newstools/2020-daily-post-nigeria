President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwunmi Adesina has backed former Nigeria Head of State, Yakubu Gowon, refuting the claims that he ”looted half of Central Bank of Nigeria to the UK.” A member of the UK Parliament, Tom Tugendhat, made the claims during a debate on the Lekki toll gate shootings of protesters. Gowon in an interview with the BBC, had described the allegation as “rubbish”, adding that he served Nigeria diligently with records to show. Also, reacting, Adesina took to his official Twitter page, describing the claims by the Member of UK Parliament as misinformation. His tweet read: “Be careful of misinformation! H.E. General Yakubu Gowon, Nigeria’s former Head of State, is a man of great honour, decency, honesty, amazing simplicity, humility and integrity.” According to him, General Gowon is a man of honour and integrity. “ I know him. A great and admirable elder statesman of Nigeria. His honesty and integrity are impeccable,” his tweet added.

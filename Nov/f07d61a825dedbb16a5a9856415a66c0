Defence Headquarters says the Air Task Force of Operation Lafiya Dole has eliminated several Boko Haram terrorists. The offensive targeted hideouts at Njimia and Dure in Sambisa forest, Borno State. Coordinator, Defence Media Operation, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, said this in a statement on Thursday. He noted that the military continued to record successes in its air campaigns against insurgents in the North-East. Enenche said the raid was conducted on Tuesday after a series of aerial surveillance missions showed resurgence of terrorists’ activities in the locations. Nigerian Air Force (NAF) attack aircraft engaged the locations. “The NAF jets scored devastating hits in their successive bomb and rocket runs, resulting in the destruction of the terrorists’ structures and neutralisation of several BHTs. “The Armed Forces of Nigeria will not relent until all enemies of the nation are neutralised and normalcy is restored to all troubled zones,” Enenche added.

Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum on Saturday unveiled a 25-year strategic recovery plan from Boko Haram devastation. Zulum decried that over the years, the sect has caused more than $6 billion worth of destruction. The plan tagged ‘Our Borno, Our Success’, has immediate, medium and long implementation phases. It is anchored on Agriculture, Commerce, Environment, Healthcare, and Human Capital Development. The governor said henceforth, all government activities will be executed in line with the development scheme.

Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed did the formal launch of the programme.

The former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, Chief Olu Falae has raised an alarm over the constant attacks on his farm by Fulani herdsmen. Falae, an elder statesman as well as Afenifere stalwart said the invasion of his farm at Ilado in Akure North Local Government Area of the state by the herdsmen has occurred over four times in the past weeks. In a letter addressed to the Commander of the Ondo State Security Network, known as Amotekun Corps, Adetunji Adeleye, Falae asked that the incident of September 21, 2015, when he was kidnapped in his farm not repeat itself. According to the letter, the incidents were reported to the Chairman Meyetti Allah in the state but that did not deter the herdsmen from destroying some sections of the vast farm with about four workers injured in the attack. The letter read “In the last few weeks, Fulani herdsmen came into my maize farm twice to eat up and trample large sessions of the farm. “I reported the incidents to Alh. Bello. Chairman Meyetti Allah for Ondo State, nothing has happened. In the last few days, they have gone to attack my citrus farm by stealing harvested oranges and destroying what they could not carry away. “The police on security duty on the farm were sent to drive them away. But they have been coming back every night to attack my workers in our camp, breaking their door and carting away all their belongings! “Please let Amotekun save us and our livelihood. They kidnapped me on 21st September 2015; they should not be allowed to do it again.”

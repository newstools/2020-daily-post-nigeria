Potiskum Chapter of the the National Transport Owners (NATO) has claimed that many of its member reportedly killed in some southeastern states during the End SARS protest, which turned violent. Chairman of the chapter, Alhaji Abdullahi Garba Alele, made the claim on Sunday in Potiskum town in Yobe State while reacting on the recent sad happening in the country. He also claimed that many articulated trailers belong to members of the Association were burnt to ashes by hoodlums. The chairman disclosed that, “in Aba, along articulated trailers belonging to the people of Yobe state were burnt beyond recognition leaving many businesses crippled. “Apart from losing millions of naira to the hoodlums the association is yet to establish contacts with many drivers. Some dead bodies were recovered, while those who survived the crisis were traumatised”. Alele, therefore, called on the federal government to constitute a committee of inquiry to ascertain the depth of damages caused by hoodlums in the southern part of the country. The Chairman, however, commended the efforts of the Rivers State Governor Nyeson Wike for his courage in restoring normalcy in his domain and security for the non indigenes residing in Rivers state. “The association is compiling all the loses incurred to the violent incident for onward submission to the Yobe state government for relevant authorities to take appropriate action”, he revealed. Recall that the End SARS peaceful protest meant to bring an end to police brutality in Nigeria was subsequently hijacked by misguided youths causing mayhem to many unsuspecting commuters, public and private investments in some parts of the country.

Former Nigeria international, Jonathan Akpoborie, has blamed the national team’s slide in FIFA’s global ranking on head coach, Gernot Rohr’s inability to make the Super Eagles a winning side. The latest FIFA ranking released on Thursday, shows that Nigeria remains Africa’s fourth-best team, dropping three places from October’s standing. The likes of Turkey and Slovakia have overtaken the three-time African champions during the 30 days under review. The Eagles’ ranking was not helped by the team’s two unimpressive draws against Sierra Leone in their AFCON 2021 qualifying series double-header. In general, Nigeria failed to win any game in 2020. “I am not too surprised that the Super Eagles dropped in the latest FIFA rankings going by their poor dismal performance against Sierra Leone in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. “The first leg at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium really exposed the tactical know-how of the manager after the team squandered a four-goal lead to draw 4-4. “How best can you explain his technical knowledge of the game? I really want to blame him for the team’s latest ranking,” Akpoborie told the Pledge.

The calls for Yayaha Bello to run for presidency in the 2023 election has been met with reactions from Nigerians. Commissioner for Information and Communication in Kogi State, Kingsley Fanwo, had announced that there is a deafening call for Governor Bello to run for presidency in the 2023 election. Fanwo made this known through his Twitter handle, even as he displayed a campaign poster convincing Nigerians that Yahaya Bello is capable to replace President Muhammadu Buhari. Alongside a picture of Bello, he wrote: “He wants a great Nigeria.Nigerians want a great Nigeria. He has done it in Kogi State. So we know the deafening calls will bring about a defining moment for our nation. We are THINKING NIGERIA. “ His statement has since been met with reactions from Nigerians who feel Bello is not competent enough to rule Nigeria. Here are some comments gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter: @Bolanlecole “Who are those mounting pressure on Gov. Yahaya Bello to run PRESIDENT? It must be the Buharists.” @Bukayo01 “In an organised society can Yahaya Bello govern a Local Government? @OkKevwe “Yahaya Bello wanting to run for President of our country na the height of see finish.
I no blame am, na Buhari stain our white.” @Krativity “Nigerians cannot endure the kind of backwardness, mediocrity, lack of ideas and hooliganism going on in Kogi state. You have not delivered in a state as small as Kogi but you are already promising to deliver on a national stage. Stop this dry joke please.” @Nathan “Please stop this joke, he is a shame to the youth. Very irresponsible governor, and let us stop promoting this region stuff. We need someone that is competent.” @MessageDictor “This is a huge joke, right? @Dotun “Religious intolerant?

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has admitted that his, “biggest concern” is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s poor form in front of goal. The Gunners fell to a 2-1 defeat at the Emirates to Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday evening. Arteta’s men have already lost to five teams this season after 10 matches. Aubameyang has not scored in open play since away at Fulham on the opening day of the season. On Sunday, he got only one shot on target and just nine touches in Wolves’ penalty area. When asked if he was worried, Arteta said: “I think we all are worried, because the main goalscorer of the club at the moment isn’t scoring goals. “So my biggest concern is how to help him more to score goals because we need his goals. “He needs to be scoring goals if we wants to be successful.”

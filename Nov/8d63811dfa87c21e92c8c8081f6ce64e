The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has warned President Muhammadu Buhari to address the demands of Nigerians, or he will put the country “on fire”. Wike’s comment comes two days after the federal government met with leaders in the South-South region. At the meeting, the South-South leaders demanded the restructuring of Nigeria, in line with the principle of true federalism. Wike, speaking on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily on Thursday, said: “We must understand in this country that political leadership is very key. “Having the political will to implement what the people want is very serious. “I don’t want to talk about the issue of distrust or no trust in government. People have raised such issues, that they don’t think that anything will come out of all this dialogue. I don’t agree with that. I believe that if the president does not do, given the opportunities he has now, then, he will be putting Nigeria on fire.”

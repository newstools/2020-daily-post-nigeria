Nigeria failed to book a spot at the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations, following a 0-0 draw with Sierra Leone on Tuesday evening. A victory in Freetown would have seen the Super Eagles qualify with two games to spare. Earlier in the day, Lesotho and Benin Republic played out a goalless draw. A win for Gernot Rohrâ€™s men would have taken them up to 10 points and ensure they finish in the top two positions in Group L no matter what. Nigeria still top the group with eight points, while Benin Republic are in second place with seven. Sierra Leone have three points and Lesotho are bottom with two. On Match Day 5, the Eagles are away to Benin Republic, where they can finally claim a ticket to the tournament.

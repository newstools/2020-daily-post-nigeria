Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said his team will need bravery and “close-to-perfect organisation” if they are to get a positive result at Manchester City on Sunday. The Reds travel to the Etihad knowing victory would move them eight points clear of one of their main title rivals. A win for City, however, would move Pep Guardiola’s side to within two points of the Premier League champions with a game in hand. City won 4-0 when the sides last met back in July, shortly after Liverpool ended their 30-year wait for the title. “If you are not 100 per cent focused on the game against City, you will lose big!” Klopp told reporters. “I am not sure I needed that game as proof, but that is 100 per cent the case. “It was the first time we won the league, so I had no idea how to prepare the next game to be honest. I didn’t want to overdo it like ‘boys forget what happened three days ago, now let’s show the whole world against City’ blah, blah, blah.”

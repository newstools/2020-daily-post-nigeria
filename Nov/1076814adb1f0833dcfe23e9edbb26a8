Former Arsenal star, Paul Merson, has named Liverpool as the favourite club to win the English Premier League, EPL, title this season despite their recent injury setbacks. Liverpool won the Premier League title last season ahead of Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea. Jurgen Klopp’s side are currently in the third position on the Premier League table and are presently having injury problems with defenders, Joe Gomez and Virgil van Dijk being sidelined for a long period. But Merson believes that losing two of their key defenders could mean that Liverpool ends up even more attack-minded this term as they aim to defend their Premier League title. “Losing Joe Gomez is just going to make Liverpool even more attack-minded and they’re still the team to beat in the title race,” Merson wrote in his column for the Daily Star. “I think it is a big test for Jurgen Klopp to be without Gomez and Virgil van Dijk for any length of time. “But the way they set up against Manchester City was probably a sign of things to come. “Playing like that gives you so many options and gets all of your attacking talents on the pitch at the same time. “That gives Liverpool a fear factor. How many teams are going to want to face them when Jota is added to that front three of Firmino, Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane? “Assuming Salah comes back quickly from his positive Covid test, those four together could be frightening over the next few months.” Merson added, “I still think they are the team to beat, even with all these injuries. If you finish above Liverpool and don’t win the league this season, you’re banging out of luck.” Liverpool will tackle Leicester City in the Premier League at Anfield next week Sunday after the international break.

Banks sale to CBN was fixed at N389 to dollar; CBN sale to BDCs will be N390 to dollar. All BDC operators to sell to end-users at not more than N392 to dollar. Each Bureau De Change is entitled to buy $10,000 weekly. The apex bank further directed that the Great Britain Pound (GBP) rate should be derived from the US Dollar across rate on the date of sale.

TV pundit, Stan Collymore, has called on the Manchester United board to sack Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. United bounced back from two consecutive defeats against Arsenal and Istanbul Basaksehir, with a come-from-behind to win at Everton on Saturday. But Collymore feels the nature of their loss to Basaksehir in the Champions League, is enough to fire Solskjaer. “The fact Manchester United beat Everton today is a ­total irrelevance. “And it won’t matter now if they go and win their next four or five games, either. “Because Wednesday’s Champions League defeat by Istanbul Basaksehir was the tipping point for Old Trafford manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. “And, if the passage of play which saw Demba Ba score for the Turks doesn’t lead to the Norwegian getting the sack, then I’m not sure what will,” Collymore wrote in his column for the UK Mirror.

Former Tottenham manager, Mauricio Pochettino, has admitted he is ready to return to management. Pochettino has been out of job for almost a year, after he was sacked by Spurs 11 months ago. The 48-year-old has been heavily linked with Manchester United, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer constantly under pressure. United were first linked with Pochettino in 2016 after the Red Devils sacked Louis van Gaal in 2016. Pochettino was also keen on replacing Jose Mourinho in December 2018, but United opted for Solskjaer. “I am always ready to go again and be involved in the game,” Pochettino said on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football. “It’s not stress when you are working, it’s not stress going into the training round to prepare the match and to compete. “I hope to go back soon, so we can start again to work. I am looking forward to being back in the game. I love this game but it’s difficult. We are inside and working on doing things. That’s the reality.”

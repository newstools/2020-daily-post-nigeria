Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has praised Bruno Fernandes’ performance in their win over Everton, but admitted the midfielder sometimes leaves him, “frustrated” with his positioning. Fernandes scored twice and provided a third for Edinson Cavani, as United fought from a goal down to win 3-1 at Goodison Park. While Solskjaer was delighted with most aspects of Fernandes’ display, he, however, pointed his tendency to get caught out of position, when trying to do too much to help the team. “Great performance. Of course leading the boys, there’s desire and determination. He’s everywhere on the pitch! “Sometimes that frustrates me, because sometimes there’re passes being played where he should have been, and he’s not there. “But you know when you’ve got someone who drives them on like this, of course, you’re very happy,” Solskjaer told MUTV.

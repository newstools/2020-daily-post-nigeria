Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi has criticised his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, describing him as a dictator. Umahi in an interview with Arise TV, revealed that Wike is single-handedly controlling the affairs of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, autocratically which has made governors on the platform unhappy with him. “Wike must know he is a dictator; he must know that one person cannot be called a crowd. “Wike must know that a lot of governors in the PDP are very sad with him,” Umahi added. According to Umahi, Wike single-handedly made Secondus the PDP Chairman and tried to impose one of his own as the minority leader in the House of Representatives. “He must know that there is nothing that happens in the PDP without his authorization.” Umahi warned Gov. Wike not to clash with him because it will be dangerous. He warned Wike to focus on the party and stop demonstrating dictatorship traits by attacking him. “Wike has called the PDP committee all kinds of unprintable names, and I have asked Gov. Wike, he is my friend, and let’s not take on ourselves because it will be very dangerous. “Focus on the party, the party does not belong to him and this is nothing personal but Wike is demonstrating the dictatorship tendencies in him by taking on me a fellow governor.”

The Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai, has again flayed the idea of zoning of political positions. Speaking at the Nigerian Economic Summit in Abuja, El-Rufai insisted that no country progresses with such an arrangement. The governor said instead every qualified person should be given equal opportunity to contest for political positions. In Nigeria, political offices especially the presidency are rotated on the basis of geographical zones. Ahead of the 2023 election, there have been calls for the presidency to return to the South. But El-Rufai argues that leaders should not be selected by zones as this “will lead to inefficiency”. He said: “There is no country in the world that has made progress in the last 50 years that rotates its leaders. I think if we move away from this fixation about distribution to selecting or picking the best person to get the job done… when the job is done, everybody benefits. “Right now, we are distributing this and we are not making any progress because the focus is on distribution.”

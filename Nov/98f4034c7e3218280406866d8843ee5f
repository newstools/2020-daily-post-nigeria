A former Liverpool and Real Madrid forward, Michael Owen, has predicted that Manchester United will secure a win against Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League fixture at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. Owen also predicted that Chelsea would beat Rennes in France tonight. He told BetVictor: “If travelling Istanbul Basaksehir watched the match, it will only give them hope that they can get something here. “That said, winning is never a bad thing, and United come into this having won both matches since their defeat to their upcoming opponents in Turkey. “United had a great result in their last UEFA Champions League match at Old Trafford when they thumped Leipzig 5-0, and if they can find that type of performance again, they should pick up a valuable three points.” On the Rennes vs Chelsea game, Owen says he expects a “professional display” from Frank Lampard’s side, predicting the Blues to seal all three points and keep a clean sheet against the French Ligue 1 side. The kick-off time for Man United vs Istanbul Basaksehir is 9 pm, while that of Rennes vs Chelsea is 6:55 pm.

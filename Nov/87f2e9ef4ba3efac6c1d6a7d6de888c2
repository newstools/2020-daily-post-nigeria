Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, on Monday confirmed that Luke Shaw and Phil Jones would take no part in his side’s squad to tackle Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. Solskjaer also said that Jesse Lingard would miss the Basaksehir clash because the England international is still self-isolating after he had contact with a COVID-19 positive. Solskjaer’s men head to the game following a 1-0 victory over West Brom in the Premier League on Saturday night. “We hope that the lads will recover quickly,” Solskjaer told MUTV. “Luke [Shaw] is out, Phil Jones [is] obviously out, still. “Jesse is still self-isolating because he’s been in contact with a COVID positive. He will be back soon. “Apart from that, we have one or two little niggles that we’ll have to make a decision on towards the end.” He added: “I hope nearer to four weeks, but with hamstrings, you can’t risk anything, and he’s still not training with us. “Hopefully, near four but more likely close to six.” The kick-off time for the match is 9 pm, Nigerian time.

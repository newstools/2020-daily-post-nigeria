The member representing Idanre/Ifedore Federal Constituency of Ondo State in the House of Representatives, Hon. Tajudeen Adefisoye on Saturday hinted on his decision to dump the Social Democratic Party, SDP. Adefisoye, 36, who is the youngest and only SDP member in the National Assembly said his plan to quit the party on which he was elected in 2019 was due to crises rocking the party both at the national and state level. According to the lawmaker, the turn of events at the national level and at the Ondo State chapter of the SDP has been “as lamentable as depressing. “Without denying the obvious, the future of the political party seems to be very shaky, just as its survival appears to depend hopelessly on the likelihood of impending barrage of intractable litigations.” Meanwhile, the statement issued by the lawmaker did not state the party he will be cross carpeting to. But findings revealed that Adefisoye who is the Deputy House Committee Chairman on Army might be making a move to the All Progressives Congress, APC, following his public support for October 10, 2020, re-election of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu.

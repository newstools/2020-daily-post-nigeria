The youth representatives at the Lagos Judicial Panel refused to sit during Saturday’s session. The Judicial Panel of Inquiry was set up by the Lagos State Government, to probe the Lekki toll gate shootings and several complaints of human rights abuses against members of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). However, after Central Bank obtained a court order to freeze the bank accounts of Adegoke Pamilerin and Bolatito Oduala, popularly known as Rinu alongside 17 others linked to the EndSARS protests, the youth reps boycotted today’s sitting. Anakle CEO, Editi Effiong, who was present at the venue tweeted the updates. “The youth panel members are NOT here. They’re pulling out in protest as one of the members’ (@SavvyRinu) bank account was frozen by @cenbank. “The panel will have to adjourn, while that is resolved. “Note: I saw Rinu earlier, wearing and #EndSARS shirt. A very bold move.” Editi then added that “The various legal teams representing LASG, Army, #EndSARS and others are responding to the boycott. “Mr. O speaking: We are embarrassed for Nigeria, that the government invited youth to the panel, and on another hand, punishing them.” The panel will now reconvene on November 14 while the bank freeze is sorted out.

Reactions have continued to trail claims by a member of the British parliament, Tom Tungendhat that former Head of State, Yakubu Gowon allegedly looted half of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN to the UK. DAILY POST had reported that the British lawmaker said this during the debate on a petition on End SARS while advocating for sanctions on Nigerian leaders who loot the country’s funds. But Aisha Yesufu, a popular activist, on Tuesday said Gowon is the worst of all Nigerian leaders who ate the food meant for the next generation. According to her, Gowon has always taken sides with the government in power and not the people. Yesufu on her Twitter page wrote: “Always many trying to whitewash Gowon. If Abacha had not died, he would be “hero” “Gowon is the worst of them all. Gowon is always with any government in power and never with the people. His self-preservation is second to none. Dubai leader was building for the next generation while Gowon was eating the food for the next generation.”

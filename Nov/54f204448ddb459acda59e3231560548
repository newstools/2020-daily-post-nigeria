Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has commented on striker Edinson Cavani’s performance following his side’s 3-2 victory against Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday. Solskjaer said that he was very pleased with Cavani’s display against Southampton, adding that the Uruguay international was fantastic against the host. Man United recovered from 2-0 down at half-time to win at St Mary’s thanks to Bruno Fernandes’ strike and a brace from Cavani. “Great impact of course,” Solskjaer told BBC Sport, “He is a number nine who wants to be in between the posts, he is always on the move. “He wants to get in front of you, and I am very pleased with him. “On the training pitch, in the dressing room and during meal times, how meticulous he is… He knows what he wants to eat, how much he wants to recover – everything! “It was a top movement, and his timing is fantastic. His hunger to get on the end of things is the key for a centre-forward.”

Manchester United star, Bruno Fernandes, has identified the club’s legend, Paul Scholes as the best midfielder ahead of Premier League legends Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard. Fernandes said this ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash against West Brom on Saturday. “I think Scholes was one of the best midfielders in the world,” Fernandes told Man Utd podcast. “For England, a lot of people talk about Frank Lampard because he scored a lot of goals of course, one of the best in England too, you have Steven Gerrard too. “But I think Scholes is the one who makes more difference than anyone else. “And before everyone starts talking about this, I have not seen every midfielder in England. “But I think in the last generation, those 3 were the 3 best ones, and for me Scholes was best.” Scholes helped Man United to win 11 Premier League titles, two Champions League and three FA Cups during his time at Old Trafford.

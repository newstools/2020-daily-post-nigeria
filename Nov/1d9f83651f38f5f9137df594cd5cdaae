The All Progressives Congress (APC) has attacked former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar. The ruling party accused the Wazirin Adamawa of scheming to “purchase” the PDP 2023 ticket. Atiku was the party’s presidential candidate in the 2019 general election. On Thursday, Yekini Nabena, APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, in a statement, mocked him and the opposition. Nabena noted that Atiku has commenced campaign and holding political meetings in Dubai. “The PDP and Alh. Atiku Abubakar, who has began early 2023 campaign on the PDP’s presidential candidature he is poised to purchase, are engrossed with their Dubai meetings to plot their hallucinatory return to ensure their bid to selloff the remainder of our national assets”, he wrote. The spokesman added that, “Nigerians are wiser.” A number of PDP chieftains have decamped to the APC. They include Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, Senator Elisha Abbo (Adamawa North), ex-PDP national chairman, Barnabas Gemade, and House of Representatives ex-Speaker, Yakubu Dogara.

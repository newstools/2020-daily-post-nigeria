The Nigerian government has insisted that only social media massacre occurred at the Lekki toll gate during the End SARS protests. It said the footage from Lekki toll gate of alleged shooting during the End SARS crisis which instigated that there was mass killing was false. Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information said this during a press conference on Thursday, stressing that the purveyors of fake news with their claims succeeded in deceiving the world that there was mass killing in Lekki without bodies. “Till date, not a single body has been produced and not a single family or relative has come out to say their child or ward was killed at Lekki. “While we await the Judicial Panel in Lagos to unravel what transpired at the Lekki Toll Gate, what we can say, based on testimonies available in the public space, is that the world may have just witnessed, for the very first time ever, a MASSACRE WITHOUT BODIES! Some have tagged it ‘social media massacre’, the Minister said. He further described the call for sanctions against Nigerian government officials on the basis of the hoax as irresponsible. “More surprising and irresponsible is the fact that some people have been calling for sanctions against Nigeria or against Nigerian government officials on the basis of a hoax. This is one of the dangers of fake news and disinformation. Once fake news is out, many run with it, without looking back, even when the truth is eventually revealed. ” The minister further called on those who have said there was a massacre at the Lekki Toll Gate to go to the Judicial Panel to present their evidence(s) to the world or simply admit that they have goofed.

Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriation, Senator Jibrin Barau has disclosed that the Nigeria Senate would get a harmonised 2021 budget from its Committee on December 3. He said some Chairman of Committees have submitted their budget reports on agencies of government, which were quite satisfactory. Speaking in Abuja late Wednesday, Senator Barau explained that the time table of December 3rd would be adhered to strictly to enable Senate Committee of the whole begin debate as soon as possible. “We look towards the submission of the budget on December 3″, he insisted. He was optimistic that cases of omission of some agencies of government who are ill-prepared would be solved before the expected date, adding that some agencies which were asked to put their budgets in proper perspectives were working seriously with Senate’s timing handed to them. “The budget proposal is a very wide process, talking about estimates of expenditures that are going to be undertaken by the Federal Government. “So, you have several expenditures and there is room for omission. But that is why we are here. “We told our own committees to go and scrutinise the budgets of ministries and report back to us. “Whatever you see in the budget, whether or not it is an omission, our work is to get the report and engage our own expert here,” he said. Barau stressed that the Senate will use their professional accountants and economist to correct any error, if there was need to do so.

Nigeria could seal qualification for the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations with a win against Sierra Leone in Freetown on Tuesday. This follows a 0-0 draw between Lesotho and Benin Republic in the first fixture played today. The Beninoise had won the reverse fixture 1-0 last week, thanks to Jodel Dossouâ€™s 24th-minute goal. But they failed to replicate their performance in the stalemate. This means that they now have seven points, while Lesotho has two points after four rounds of matches. Victory for the Super Eagles against the Leone Stars will take them up to 10 points and ensure they finish in the top two positions in Group L.

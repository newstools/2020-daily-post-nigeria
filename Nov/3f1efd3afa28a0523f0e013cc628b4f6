The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Sunday, condemned the beheading of 43 farmers by Boko Haram insurgents in Zabarmari, Borno State. PDP said the action was an indication of President Muhammadu Buhari’s failure to ensure the safety of Nigerians. The party described the act as extreme wicked, devilish which must not be left unaddressed. In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the opposition party lamented that Buhari has failed to take decisive action to quell insecurity in Nigeria. According to Ologbondiyan: “The PDP notes with pain that this horrific killing of compatriots comes as yet another of the recurring horrid testament and badge of failure of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led APC administration to secure our nation and guarantee the safety of lives and property in our country. “Indeed, our party is distressed by the escalated killing and maiming of innocent Nigerians by insurgents, bandits and marauders, who have continued to ravage and pillage our communities, while the lazy and lethargic Buhari administration continues with its lip service, rhetoric and false performance claims. “The PDP is particularly disturbed because of the failure of the Buhari Presidency to take decisive action despite series of concerns raised by Borno state governor, Baba Gana Zulum, of security compromises in the state. “The Buhari administration appears helpless while our national security structure under President Buhari seems to have collapsed. Our nation appears to be on auto pilot with no one in charge while the ship of state continues to drift. “All our nation gets from the Buhari Presidency is that ‘Mr. President is shocked’, ‘Mr. President is saddened’, ‘Mr. President regrets’ and such lame responses without any decisive policy direction or directive to definitively tackle the situation at hand, leading to escalation of killings in our country.”

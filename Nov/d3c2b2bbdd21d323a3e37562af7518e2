Manchester United are sweating on the fitness of first-choice centre-back pair Harry Maguire and Victor Lindelof, ahead of their Premier League clash against West Brom on Saturday, ESPN reports. Maguire completed 90 minutes for England against Iceland on Wednesday, but reported bruising to his foot afterwards and will be assessed when he returns to Carrington on Thursday. Meanwhile, club medical staff are very concerned about Lindelofâ€™s back injury. The 26-year-old has been managing the issue for much of the season, but the problem flared up again during the 3-1 victory at Everton before the international break. Lindelof featured for 90 minutes for Sweden in their 2-1 win over Croatia on Saturday but was forced off during the second half of their 4-2 defeat to France on Tuesday. United have Tuanzebe available to step in and Eric Bailly is close to a return after missing more than a month with a muscle problem. Bailly has not featured since the 6-1 defeat to Tottenham on October 4. United are hopeful of having left-back Alex Telles available, after returning a negative test for COVID-19 while on international duty with Brazil.

The United States President-Elect, Joe Biden, has pointed out how President Donald Trump would be remembered. Biden said Trump would go down in history as one of the most irresponsible president in the history of the US. The US Democratic Party’s presidential candidate made the remark as Trump tried to take extraordinary action in ‘subverting’ the outcome of the 2020 election. He spoke at a news conference after meeting with Republican and Democratic governors. According to Biden: “Americans are witnessing incredible irresponsibility and an incredibly damaging message is being sent to the rest of the world about how democracy functions. “It’s hard to fathom how this man thinks. It’s hard to fathom. It’s just outrageous, what he’s doing. “Trump will go down in history as one of the most irresponsible presidents.”

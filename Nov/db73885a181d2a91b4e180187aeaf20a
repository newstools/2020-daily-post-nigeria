Former Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has claimed Arsenal players are disrespecting manager Mikel Arteta, by calling the Spaniard by his first name. Keane was speaking after the Gunners beat his former club 1-0 on Sunday at Old Trafford. Arteta’s tactical plan was implemented perfectly, as Arsenal piled the pressure on United by pressing them high up the pitch. The Gunners grabbed the winner in the second half as Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored from the spot, after Paul Pogba gave away a penalty for a foul on Hector Bellerin. Speaking on Sky Sports after the game, former Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp praised Aubameyang for talking glowingly about Arteta after the game. However, Keane felt Aubameyang was wrong to call his manager by his first name. “They didn’t show him respect when they called him by his name, Mikel. “He’s the manager, the boss, the gaffer. That’s respect. ‘Not Mikel, he’s not his mate,” Keane said.

Eleanor Nwadinobi, Co-Chair of Every Woman Treaty Steering Committee, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for voicing support for the treaty to end violence against women and girls. The Medical Women’s International Association President was on a delegation of Nigerian women that visited Buhari at the State House on Thursday. The visit was led by Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen. In a statement on Friday, Nwadinobi said the Nigerian leader’s endorsement was heartwarming. “I heard with my own ears the firm commitment from Mr. President that he would support the Chair of the African Union president Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa in his call for a treaty to end violence against women and girls at the African Union Summit in February 2021. “This pronouncement takes us one step closer to a world where women and girls for generations to come will live free from violence”, she noted. Every Woman Treaty is upbeat about “the upcoming leadership change in the United States whereupon President-elect Joseph R. Biden served as the principal author and advocate for the Violence Against Women Act”. Nwadinobi added that there is an opportunity to ensure that pandemic violence against women and girls will be a leading issue for the coming years.

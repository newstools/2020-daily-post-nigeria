Popular Nigerian Singer, Davido has stirred reactions from Nigerians on social media after he declared Mayorkun as the biggest artiste. Davido said this during his recent interview with ShadeRoom. When asked who is the biggest artiste among him, Wizkid and Burna boy, Davido said: “The biggest artiste is Mayorkun. Mayorkun of Lagos is bigger.” His comment has since stirred reactions from Nigerians who applauded him for not declaring himself as the best. However, some criticised him, saying Omah Lay is even better than Mayorkun. Here are some comments gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter: @Gben_chov “ I cherish you @davido wise response. Let them deal with it.” @Jayythedope “ Davido was asked who’s the biggest artiste globally among him, Burna boy and Wizkid. Man said Mayorkun. ” @Sanematic “ This is actually a smart answer.” @Slidelly “ Person wey don ment. Last week he’s the biggest, today na Mayorkun, who knows tomorrow e fit be father DMW. He is desperate for attention and Wizkid no send. Na show plus interview we watch yesterday. Wizkid no hate no slander any artist.” @Kalakukuzi “ Omay Lay is bigger than Mayorkun.” @Fia_boi “ You guys were ever ready to drag him if he said he was the one and mock him if he said wizzy or Burna boy. That was smart.” @Hameedl “ Davido really needs to stop talking. He shouldn’t put pressure on Mayorkun abeg.” @Nwaforjeff “ As Wizkid, Davido and Burna have all gone international. I think Mayorkun will be among the artistes to control our industry. It’s his time.” @Jessicaaduru “ Omo, Davido cannot even rest, every interview the interviewer must mention Wizkid or Burna boy. Unnecessary drama.” @H2.o “ I hate that they keep doing this to Davido. Every time he has an interview, they are always bringing this “Wizkid, Davido, Burna” BS to his space. We just watched Wizkid for 3 hours and not one person asked that foolish question.”

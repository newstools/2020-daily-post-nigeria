Arsenal defender, William Saliba, is not happy with his situation at the club and now wants to leave in January, But reports. Saliba, 19, was signed in a £27million deal from Saint-Etienne, but after joining up with Mikel Arteta’s squad in the summer, he is yet to make his competitive debut. Arsenal were willing to loan Saliba to a Championship club for the remainder of the season, but a move has failed to materialize. The teenager is, however, playing regularly for Arsenal’s U-23s, with Arteta of the opinion the defender is a long way off a regular first-team role. Saliba’s chances of playing time were reduced even further last month, when Arteta left him out of the Europa League squad. The youngster is now “fed up” with his situation at the Emirates and is now looking for a move away in the next transfer window. He is open to the idea of returning to Saint-Etienne, having spent last season on loan at his boyhood club before moving to Arsenal.

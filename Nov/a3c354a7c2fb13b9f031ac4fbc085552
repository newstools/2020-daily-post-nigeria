Adeola Adedipe, a lawyer, has applied to withdraw his services from the former chairman, Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina’s case of money laundering, the Nation reports. Adedipe, who is representing Maina’s company, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd, told Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja, on Wednesday at the resumption of proceedings in the case, that he has filed a notice, signifying his intention to withdraw from further representation of his client.

In his ruling, Justice Abang, who on the previous day, held that, by being absent in court, Adedipe had abandoned proceedings, said that the notice the lawyer claimed to have filed was not in the court’s file. Meanwhile, Maina has repeatedly failed to appear in court for the continuation of his trial which led to the revocation of his bail by Justice Abang. Abang also ordered a bench warrant for Maina’s arrest anywhere he is sighted. Details…

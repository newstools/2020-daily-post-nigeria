A member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Jude Idimogu, on Friday insisted that the political future of people of South-East Nigeria lies in the APC. Idimogu an APC, Oshodi-Isolo Constituency II chieftain and Deputy Apex Leader, Ndigbo in Lagos APC, stated this while reacting to Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi’s defection from the PDP to the APC. The two-term lawmaker explained that it was time politicians from the South East embraced the ruling party to actualise their hopes and aspirations for the region. “Our party is a great party; APC is the hope. I thank God that one of our governors in the eastern states, Gov. David Umahi of Ebonyi has defected to the ruling APC. “The truth is that the Igbo have a better future in the APC as a party than in any other party. We thank God that Gov. Umahi has realised this and defected to our great party. “This is to tell my other brothers and sisters that Igbo has a future in the APC. I believe with time, that other bigwigs of Igbo extraction will join the APC. “This is what we want; this is a good thing. APC is the party to beat. APC is the party we should belong to. It is a party that will give Igbo a future after God. It is a party we must work for,’’ Idimogu told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN).

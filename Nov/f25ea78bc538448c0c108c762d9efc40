A coalition of Civil Society Organisations, CSOs, has raised the alarm over the attacks targeted on activists and pro-democracy campaigners since the start of End SARS protests by the Nigerian government. The Coalition warned against the hunting down of End SARS protesters and promoters across the country. Recall that some popular Nigerians who threw their weight behind the End SARS protest had been dragged before a Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court in Abuja. An activist, Kenechukwu Okeke, had dragged those linked with the protest before the court for alleged conspiracy. However, the coalition expressed concern over the clampdown on promoters of the protest. The coalition stated this in a statement jointly signed by the following, Centre for Democracy and Development, CDD, Enough is Enough, EIE, Nigeria, Partners for Electoral Reform, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, CISLAC, Resource Centre for Human Rights and Civic Education, CHRICED. Others included: Social Action, Right to Know, Lawyers Alert, Private and Public Development Centre, South Saharan Social Development Organisation, Partners West Africa- Nigeria, Centre, LSD, Connected Development, CODE. The statement reads: “We express grave concerns about the rise in the level of attacks targeted at human rights activists and pro-democracy campaigners especially since the start of the #EndSARS protests. “This Coalition is aware that the Nigerian authorities have stepped up measures to clamp down on individuals, organisations and corporate bodies alleged to be the masterminds of the protests. “Increasingly, protest organisers are being intimidated and coerced by various state institutions.” Some of the promoters of the End SARS protests had cried out over travel ban placed on them by the Nigerian government over their association with the protest. Also, some of the protesters were arrested and arraigned in court by security operatives

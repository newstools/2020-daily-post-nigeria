The presidency has reacted to the news making the rounds that former Minister of Education, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili, turned the request to be President Muhammadu Buhari running mate back in 2011. Recall that the senior pastor of the Citadel Global Community Church, Tunde Bakare, had recounted how Ezekwesili turned down the request to be Buhari’s running mate in 2011. Pastor Bakare, who was telling the story of how he met and became Buhari’s running mate in 2011, said he listened to the advice of Pastor Enoch Adeboye before accepting to run with Buhari. And during the week, Ezekwesili took to her official Twitter handle to confirm Bakare’s claim. And as the argument lingers, activist, Aisha Yesufu, added that Ezekwesili did not just turn down Buhari but did same to former Presidents Goodluck Jonathan and Umaru Yar’Adua who wanted her in their separate cabinets. She wrote, “Since we are in the era of saying it as it is. Let it also be on record that Goodluck Ebele Jonathan wanted Dr Oby Ezekwesili @obyezeks to be Minister and she refused. The late President Yar’adua also offered her ministerial appointment and she turned it down.” And in reaction, President Buhari Assistant on New Media, Bashir Ahmad, mocked Ezekwesili, reminding Mrs. Yesufu that Nigerians rejected the former Minister in 2019 when she wanted to be President. “Saying it as it is, she also begged Nigerians to offer her the Presidency. “And, we rejected her,” Ahmad tweeted in response to Aisha Yesufu.

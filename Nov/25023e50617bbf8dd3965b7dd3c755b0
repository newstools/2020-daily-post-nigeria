Cable News Network, CNN, has remained adamant in the face of threat of sanctions from the Nigerian Government, insisting that it stands by its investigative report. CNN had on Wednesday, released a documentary of the alleged shooting of End SARS protesters by soldiers at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020. It said its report was based on testimonies from dozens of witnesses and verified footage of soldiers appearing to shoot in direction of protesters. A statement by its spokesperson published on CNN’s official website read, “our reporting was carefully and meticulously researched, and we stand by it.” Nigeria’s Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, earlier on Thursday called for sanctions to be placed on CNN for the report. Mohammed maintained that the military fired blank bullets at the Lekki Toll Gate and not even at protesters but into the air.

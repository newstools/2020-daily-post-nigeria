Watford striker, Troy Deeny, has said Manchester United players don’t respect manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Deeney also feels Solskjaer has been fortunate to be given plenty time to get things right at Old Trafford. A defeat to Arsenal in the Premier League on Sunday, has put the United manager back under the microscope. The Red Devils are 15th on the table and already nine points behind defending champions and league leaders Liverpool. Asked if Solskjaer was the right man for the job, Deeney told TalkSport: “If you had to look back over 100 games, you’d probably say “no”. “I don’t think anybody else with that record would get the length of time he’d done. “He seems like a lovely guy, I don’t know him, it’s not personal, I just don’t think he demands the respect off the other players.”

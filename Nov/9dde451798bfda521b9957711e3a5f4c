Some Pensioners in Osun State on Wednesday shut down the entrance of the State Government Secretariat, Abere Osogbo, demanding for the payment of their entitlements. The pensioners who left the service under Contributory Pension Scheme, protested over non-payment of their pension. Armed with different placards, “we are dying of hunger”, “Masses, help us we are dying”, “Dead people cannot enjoy infrastructure”, among others. Some of the pensioners, who spoke with journalists, lamented the hardship they have been made to face due to the owed entitlements by the state government. Secretary to the State Government, Wole Oyebamiji, who attended to the protesters, implored them to exercise more patience, assuring them that the government will see to their demands. Prince Oyebamiji revealed that the Government was aware of the enormous challenges of accumulated unpaid pension for some years back, which the administration of Governor Gboyega Oyetola is addressing through prompt release of funds into the pension account of the State. Prince Oyebamiji maintained that, as at Tuesday, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola, approved and paid another trance of money into the pension account as a means of meeting up with pension payment in the State.

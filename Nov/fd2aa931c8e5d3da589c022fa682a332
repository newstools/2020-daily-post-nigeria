Three men have been arrested by men of the Ogun State police command during a robbery operation in Iju area of Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government. The police told DAILY POST that the suspects are “members of a robbery gang who have been terrorizing Iju-Ota and its environs for quite some time.” The suspects are: Bamidele Oluwashina, 31; Adebowale Kehinde, 32 and Oluwasegun Abayomi. They were arrested on November 12. Abimbola Oyeyemi, the Ogun police image maker, said in a statement on Sunday that the trio were arrested following a distress call received by the police at Onipanu divisional headquarters at about 9:30 pm. The police, Oyeyemi disclosed, were alerted that robbers have invaded Iju Love bus stop and Tipper Garage, wielding dangerous weapons and dispossessing people of their valuables. As a result of the information, the DPO of Onipanu division, CSP Bamidele Ishola Job, mobilized his men to the scene and engaged the robbers in a gun duel. “Having realized the superior fire power of the police, the hoodlums took to their heels but one of them was arrested at the scene. “The entire area was cordoned off while police intensified search for other members of the gang with the help of members of the community, two other members of the gang were sighted trying to escape in a tricycle and they were promptly arrested,” he said. DAILY POST learnt that a victim, one Tosin Ajayi, who was matcheted on the head by the hoodlums was quickly taken to the hospital by the police for medical treatment. A locally made pistol and two live cartridges were recovered from the suspects. The suspects are to be transferred to the state CIID for discreet investigation as ordered by the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun.

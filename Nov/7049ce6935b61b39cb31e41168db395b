Former Osun State Governor, Rauf Aregbesola, has congratulated his successor, Gboyega Oyetola, on his second anniversary in office. In a letter, the Minister of Interior said he was confident Oyetola will perform well. Aregbesola recalled the “hard-fought battle” of his election which culminated in the continuation of progressive administration in Osun. Noting that Nigeria has faced economic crisis, COVID-19 pandemic, and others, the minister hailed the governor for weathering the storm. Aregbesola added that the challenges will present a new format as he steps into the third year. “These are heightened political participation, the pressure to deliver more dividends of democracy, and increased demands from the political system. I have no doubt that you will cope nicely. “Please continue to make the welfare of the people your biggest concern. They are the reason for the state. Without them, there will be no government or political office to occupy.” Oyetola, Aregbesola’s ex-Chief of Staff, was elected on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform in 2018. There are speculations that their relationship is strained.

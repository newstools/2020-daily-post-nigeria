John Kelly, former Chief of Staff to President Donald Trump, has lamented the delay in starting transition of power in the US. Kelly said the delay was hurting national security. “It’s not a process where you go from zero to 1,000 miles per hour,” he told Politico. Also, a group of more than 150 former national security officials has urged the General Service Administration, GSA, to officially recognise the Democratic Party candidate, Joe Biden as the winner of the November 3 presidential election without further delay. The group said this will enable them [Biden team] access “pressing national security issues,” according to BBC. Joe Biden has not been getting a daily security briefing despite emerging as the President-elect over a week ago. A growing number of Republicans are also asking that Biden to be given full recognition as the President-elect which would enable him get daily intelligence briefings.

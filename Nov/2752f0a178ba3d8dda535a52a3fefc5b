Speaking during his valedictory service, Ikpeazu described the late Commissioner of Environment as “friend who is loyal to you both in your presence and absence.” He further said that he has lost one of his “life’s most palatable experiences: trust, loyalty and dedication personified” while praying that God gives his family the fortitude to bear the loss. “On the sad demise of Engr (Dr) Solomon Ogunji, our immediate past Commissioner for Environment, whose Valedictory Service was held today, I just realized a friend is a gift you give to yourself. “The world is in need of good people, people who can stand with you through thick and thin! A friend who is loyal to you both in your presence and absence, ready to fiercely fight your cause! “A friend in whose hands you can entrust your life without batting an eyelid! Solo was such a friend, devoid of petty sentiments. “He was a freak for logic and superior argument, a team player and lover of progress! When will another grace our clime? “When again will we encounter such a beautiful soul? In the demise of Solo, I have lost one of my life’s most palatable experiences: trust, loyalty and dedication personified,” he said.

Villarreal manager, Unai Emery, has predicted Samuel Chukwueze might leave LaLiga for a different league. Chukwueze has been linked with Spanish giants Real Madrid and Premier League outfit Everton, among others. On Saturday, the Super Eagles’ winger came off the bench to win a penalty for Villarreal, as they held Real to a 1-1 draw at Estadio de la Ceramica. So far, the 21-year-old has scored one goal and provided two assists in all competitions. “We are very happy with Samuel Chukwueze, he’s growing up with us at this club,” Emery said in a press conference. “His performance is getting better little by little but above all, we want to achieve with him our performance with his skills and capacity. He’s young and has a very good future but first, he’s with us trying to get better with his performances for us and the national team. “In the future, he can go to another league to grow up more, but I think he’s very happy with us and every match he plays, he tries to give the best performance.” The Nigeria international has been at Villarreal since 2017 and his contract deal is expected to expire in June 2023.

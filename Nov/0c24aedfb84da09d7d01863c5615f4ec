The Nasarawa State House of Assembly has called on government and security agents to unravel the killers of Mr. Philip Shekwo, the State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Speaker of the House, Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi, made the call during the House proceedings in Lafia on Monday. Balarabe-Abdullahi made the demand after Alhaji Tanko Tunga, the Majority Leader of the House, moved a motion under the Matters of Public Interest on the death of Shekwo. He said that unravelling and punishing the perpetrators of the evil act would serve as a deterrent to others and ensure sustainable peace in the state. “The resolution of this House is to the effect that, Members advised His Excellency, Gov. Abdullahi Sule, to direct the security agents, to work hard to unravel the perpetrators of this act, to face justice. “Security agents are to intensify efforts to protect the lives and property of the citizens. “Government should provide adequate support to the security agents, to effectively protect lives and property,” he said. According to him, the late chairman was a man of peace and an easy-going man, and this is one death, too many. “We have lost a leader in the state and may his soul rest in perfect peace,” the Speaker said.

Kabul University in Afghanistan was attacked on Monday. The institution was hosting the ‘Afghanistan and Iran book exhibition’. Thousands, including students, staff and visitors, scampered as armed men fired sporadically. By the time security forces overpowered the assailants, 19 people were dead. Students were held captive while the gun battle lasted for hours. Operatives eliminated three attackers. “Several terrorists and enemies of knowledge entered Kabul University,” CBS News quoted Tariq Arian of the Interior Ministry as saying. Arian noted that police rescued many people, adding that at least 19 were killed and 22 others wounded. Vice President Amrullah Saleh called the attack an “intelligence failure” and blamed it on the Taliban. Saleh accused Pakistan of collaborating with militants. “The next door won’t be able to wash their conscience of this stinking and non-justifiable attack on Kabul university”, he said But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid has dissociated his group from the massacre. “Targeting educational institutions is a heinous crime. Students have the right to study in peace and security”, declared Abdullah Abdullah, the Chairman, Afghan High Council for National Reconciliation.

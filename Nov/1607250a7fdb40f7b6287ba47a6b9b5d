Arsenal winger, Nicolas Pepe, is facing a fight for his future at the club. The UK Times reports that manager, Mikel Arteta will meet the £72million signing from Lille on Tuesday. Arteta handed Pepe a rare start in the Premier League against Leeds on Sunday, but the Ivorian was shown a straight red for headbutting Ezgjan Alioski in the second. His action left Arteta furious after the game and the Spaniard termed the player’s behaviour as “unacceptable”. Pepe was given a dressing down in front of the squad, but he will now meet Arteta privately to discuss the matter. Arteta is not expected to fine him, as he will likely start against Molde in the Europa League, as Arsenal enter a hectic fixture period. Nevertheless, the manager is far from happy with Pepe and his latest actions have added to Arteta’s ‘misgivings’ about the club’s record signing. Even before his red card against Leeds, Arteta was questioning the winger’s inconsistency and decision-making, with Pepe now battling to win back his manager’s favour.

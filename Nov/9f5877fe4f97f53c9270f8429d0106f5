Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of Osun State has highlighted reasons why hoodlums hijacked the End SARS protests. Oyetola disclosed that the lack of proper coordination by posters led to hoodlums hijacking the protests and causing havoc in some states. The governor made the remark during the inauguration of his second term campaign by the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the Iwo area of the state, on Friday. Represented by his Deputy, Gboyega Alabi, the governor urged protesters to pick leaders during their protests in the future. “Concerning the recent EndSARS protest that just took place, the only thing I can say as advice is that a protest without a leader is liable to be hijacked. Normally, they are supposed to come up with a negotiation with the government. “I’ll advise them that next time they want to embark on a protest or rally, there should be leaders that will help them channel their negotiations on the negotiation table. They need good leadership for their commitments,” he said.

Former England midfielder, Jack Wilshere, has said the truth about Mesut Ozil’s exile at Arsenal will come out “one day”. Ozil has not played under manager, Mikel Arteta since football resumed after lockdown. The German playmaker has also been excluded from the squads for both the Premier League and Europa League. Wilshere believes the 32-year-old should be playing a more prominent role for Arsenal, as they continue to struggle on the domestic front. “I think he’d be a big player in that team,” Wilshere told Sky Sports. “I would love to see Ozil play in that team under Arteta but obviously that’s not happening at the moment. He could get on the ball and feed the likes of [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang and [Alexandre] Lacazette. “I loved playing with him. He was a top player. It’s a shame, but what is happening is happening, and no one knows but I’m sure everyone will find out one day.”

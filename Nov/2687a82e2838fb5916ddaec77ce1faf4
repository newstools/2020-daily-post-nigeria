A women advocacy group, Women in Shelter and Environment has blamed poverty and financial problems as the major cause of marriage crashes in Nigeria. The group made the assertion while addressing journalists in Ibadan on Monday. President of the group, Ambassador Olamide Talabi, however, says the group is ready to provide shelter, psycho-social and financial support for thousands of women who have been abused by their husbands. Talabi who doubles as the African Commissioner at the Office of the Mayor in the city of Newark, United States said the group wishes to establish shelters for women who have been abused or passing through hard times in their marriages across the country. Talabi flanked by other members of the group among whom are a veteran journalist, Monica Taiwo, Mrs. Caroline Adeneye and Mrs Nike Ajayi noted that most marriages collapse due to financial constraints and the inability of the couple to sustain the family. She said many women who have been victimized, abused or molested in their marriages will find solace in the centres which would have branches across the country. Talabi said, “Sometimes when the man that is bringing money to the home stops bringing, there will be frictions in the family. So we want to empower these women also whereby they can take care of themselves. “We are going to have a shelter home for abused women. These are women that are going through a lot of domestic violence at home, these are women that cannot take care of themselves, mentally, psychologically and financially. “So, the goal is to have them in the house, empower them, we have vocational training there, where they will learn a trade, we have tailoring, we have bead making, we have so many things that they can learn and go back to the world. Just to empower them. “Women can also support their husbands, sometimes it is the financial problem that is causing marriage crashes. “A lot of things that is causing marital crises is the financial problem.”

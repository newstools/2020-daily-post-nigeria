Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has leapt to the defence of Alexandre Lacazette after the striker came in for criticism following their 3-0 defeat to Aston Villa. Lacazette missed a sitter at 1-0, before Ollie Watkins bagged his brace to settle the contest. Although the Gunners were poor on the day, the Frenchman was the target of angry fans on social media. Lacazette scored three goals in his first three appearances of the season, but has not found the net in any of his last six games. However, Arteta has insisted he and his staff must do more to “help” underperforming players like Lacazette. “My job is to get the best out of the players and put them in the best possible scenarios. “If they’re not performing it’s because we have to help them more,” Arteta said after the game.

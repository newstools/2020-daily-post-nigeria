Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has said that Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur have a better chance of winning the Premier League title this season because of Liverpool’s ongoing injury crisis. Tottenham is currently on top of the Premier League table ahead of Liverpool (second) and Chelsea (third) after nine games. Speaking on The Gary Neville Podcast, he said: “For a period under Jose Mourinho, I did not feel as though Spurs had an identity. They looked like they were in transition. “I didn’t think the players were having this under Jose. But I am changing my mind dramatically. “The team look really up for it, and they fancy the challenge. The triangle of goalkeeper and centre-backs is the worry for Tottenham. “I still don’t think they will win the league. I don’t think they are anywhere near Liverpool, personally. “But it’s a strange season, and we are seeing strange things happen. Liverpool have injuries which mean they are weaker and will drop more points.” Neville added: “It was a really good win for Chelsea [ at Newcastle United] and we are all excited for that Tottenham game. “We thought Chelsea would be interesting at the start of the season because they invested big on young and exciting players. “It looks like Lampard is starting to get it right. He was searching in the first few weeks for his best system where he could fit everybody in. “He is starting to work it out, and they are looking pretty strong. “Is it a season where by Lampard and Mourinho could be up against each other in a title race? We would never have thought that. We thought it would be a two-horse race between Liverpool and Man City. “Having watched City earlier in the season, I thought Liverpool would run away with it. But not now, not with the Van Dijk injury, that’s a game-changer in terms of exposing Liverpool a lot more.”

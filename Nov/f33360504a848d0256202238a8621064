President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday, expressed his determination to root out all forms of insurgency and insecurity in Nigeria. To this end, Buhari said he has given the military a marching order to ensure that all forms of insurgency are rooted out. He disclosed this while assuring Nigerians of his administration’s resolution to ensure the protection of lives and properties of Nigerians. In a series of tweets on his verified Twitter handle, the president promised to engage neighbouring countries in a bid to ensure insurgents have no hiding place. According to Buhari: “Nothing is more important than ensuring the security of lives and property of Nigerians. Everything is secondary when security is at stake. I will ensure that more resources are made available to the military and other security agencies to prosecute the war against terrorism. “As we mourn all the lives lost in Zabarmari, the Armed Forces have been given the marching order to take the fight to the insurgents, not on a one-off, but on a continuous basis, until we root out the terrorists. “We will intensify our cooperation with neighbouring countries on bilateral and multilateral levels, to ensure that there is no hiding place for the terrorists. “As I noted earlier, the massacre by Boko Haram in Zabarmari is nothing short of senseless, barbaric, gruesome and cowardly. It reinforces our resolve to root out all forms of insurgency and insecurity not just in Borno but everywhere across Nigeria.”

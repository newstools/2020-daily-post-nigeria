Former England midfielder, Owen Hargreaves, has advised Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Eddie Nketiah and Joe Willock to leave Arsenal on loan, following their 4-1 win over Molde in the Europa League. Bukaya Saka has become an integral player in Mikel Arteta’s side, but the club’s other emerging academy products have struggled for regular minutes in the first-team. Willock was named man of the match for the second time on the bounce in the Europa League on Thursday, after winning the award for his display at home to Dundalk last week. Nketiah also shone with his energy and work-rate and had a goal disallowed for offside in the first half at the Emirates. When asked whether the three youngsters were ‘forcing the manager’s hand’ with their impressive showings, Hargreaves replied: “It might not just be at Arsenal right now as Saka has forced his way in because he’s been absolutely magnificent. “But the problem is that in a big team like this – we saw it with Jadon Sancho at Manchester City – it’s hard to get games there. “Even for Phil Foden, as good as he is, he has to work around [Kevin] De Bruyne and David Silva last season and [Ilkay] Gundogan and Bernardo Silva. These young kids in these huge teams, it’s hard. “You might see that from these kids because right now it feels like they could probably play more. ‘The opportunities aren’t there because Arsenal have a world-class team. Remember Mesut Ozil’s at home, he can’t get anywhere near this team.”

Former Nigeria international, Ifeanyi Udeze, has urged Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, to make sure his players are psychologically prepared in order to beat Sierra Leone in today’s 2020 AFCON qualifier tie in Freetown. Udeze wants Rohr to make Super Eagles players play with their heart against John Keister’s men. Rohr’s men head to the match after playing a 4-4 draw against Sierra Leone in the first leg reverse encounter in Benin City, Edo State last Friday. “Rohr must make sure the players are psychologically prepared for the game and let them come out today and play with their heart, play good football and also win,” Udeze told Brila FM on Tuesday. “For me, I do not want to know the scoreline. All I need is the three points. So all the best to Rohr and all the best to the players.” The match’s kick-off time is 5 pm.

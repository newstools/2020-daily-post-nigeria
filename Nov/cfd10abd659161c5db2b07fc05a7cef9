The Minster of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola has directed the contractor handling the reconstruction of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway to speed up work ahead of the Yuletide. Fashola who gave the directive while inspecting the highway on Saturday, told the Julius Berger team to hurry construction ahead of the Yuletide, NAN reports. He urged the contractors to liaise with the Federal Controllers of Works in Lagos and Ogun States towards fixing important sections to make the road motorable, safe and free of traffic congestion. The minister also urged the firm to improve the quality and spread of signages and diversion signs around the construction zone and accelerate work towards Christmas celebration. Fashola urged the contractors whose section spanned from Ojota in Lagos to Sagamu Interchange to make the construction wear a ‘human face’ that will address hardship of road users. “Understand that you do it for people and we want a sense of compassion. Plan with the controllers of Lagos and Ogun,” he said.

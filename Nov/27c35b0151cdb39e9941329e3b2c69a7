Onetime Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has reacted to the defection of Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Fayose said Umahi’s defection to APC has nothing to do with the interest of the Igbo nation. The PDP chieftain stressed that Umahi defected to APC a long time ago but only made his decision known yesterday. In a tweet, the former governor wrote: “Gov Umahi defected to APC long ago before this unjustifiable move, which clearly has nothing to do with the interest of the Igbo nation. “This is a reflection of the type of leadership our country parades. “Though his action dampens hope for liberation, but I’m sure Nigerians will laugh last because sometimes, it will appear to have gotten so bad before it will begin to get better.” Umahi who defected to APC had anchored his decision on PDP’s marginalization of the South East.

Renowned banker and founder of Stanbic IBTC Bank Plc, Atedo Peterside, has accused the Federal Government of being biased for permitting Dangote Cement to resume exports across land borders. Bloomberg had reported that Dangote resumed cement exportation to Niger and Togo for the first time in 2020 through authorization given by the Buhari-led administration. This is despite the closure of land borders as ordered by Buhari. Reacting, Peterside in a tweet on Tuesday queried why only Dangote’s company was allowed to export goods outside Nigeria through land borders. He explained that the development was the reason some people argue that Nigeria is rigged in favour of well-connected persons. “Allowing legitimate exporters & importers to move their goods across the border should be a no-brainer. Why refuse everybody else & allow only one company (Dangote)? ”This is why some of us argue that the Nigerian economy is rigged in favour of a handful of well-connected persons,” he said.

Armed men are launching repeated attacks on children, teachers and schools in Cameroon’s restive Anglophone region, the UN said on Thursday. The UN Humanitarian coordinator in Cameroon, Matthias Naab, in a statement said the gunmen launched five of such assaults in less than two weeks in the country’s North-West and South-West regions. On Wednesday, armed men also attacked a college in the town of Limbe, torturing teachers and children. On the same day, nine children were kidnapped on their way to school in Fundong but later released, according to Naab. On Tuesday, unidentified armed men kidnapped 11 teachers and school staff from a primary and secondary school in the town of Kumbo, NAN reports. Another 15 schoolchildren from Bamenda were abducted on their way back from school on Oct. 23, six of them were released the following day, several of whom had been subjected to torture and had to be hospitalised. A day later, gunmen killed eight school children in the town of Kumba. “No group has so far claimed responsibility for the attacks. These incidents are part of a pattern of violence by non-state armed groups who are calling on residents to boycott schools in the two regions,’’ Naab said.

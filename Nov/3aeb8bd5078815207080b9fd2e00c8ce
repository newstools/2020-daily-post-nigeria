The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Raji Fashola, has been told to give special recognition to Ogun State in road construction. Ogun State Governor, Prince Dapo Abiodun, made this appeal on Saturday at a stakeholders’ town hall meeting attended by the Minister at the Ogere end of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Abiodun said Ogun State plays host to the largest industrial hub in the country, adding that roads in the state have become deplorable due to activities of heavy duty trucks. “It is just right to say that Ogun State deserves a special status in terms of consideration for road constructions. “I believe this is doable. It is not just for Ogun State, it is for the common good of all Nigerians and continued development of our great nation,” he noted. According to Abiodun, most part of the Lagos-Ibadan highway lies within Ogun State, adding that the road has over time deteriorated and become a nightmare to motorists and other road users. The Governor also appealed to the Federal Government for the takeover of the Lagos-Sango-Abeokuta road to take the load off the Lagos-Ibadan road as well as the 19.8km Atan-Lusada-Agbara road. Speaking, Fashola assured that FG would work with Ogun State to address the environmental challenges posed by the road construction works. The Minister noted that FG has heard the request of the state on other roads, saying that attention would be given as funds are available, a statement by the Ogun State Government stated on Saturday.

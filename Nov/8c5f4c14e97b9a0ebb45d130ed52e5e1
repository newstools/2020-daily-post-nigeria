Unknown hoodlums in the early hours of Thursday, burnt down parts of Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area Headquarters in Abia State. This was disclosed by the Abia State Government and was contained in a release signed by Barrister Chris Ezem, the Secretary to the State Government, SSG, and made available to newsmen in Umuahia. The State Government has consequently directed law enforcement agents to investigate, apprehend and diligently prosecute all those behind the dastardly act. It, however, condemned in its entirety such act of wanton destruction of public property, vowing that it will leave no stone unturned in bringing those behind such an act to book.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854367" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201112-WA0014.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201112-WA0014.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201112-WA0014-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> According to the release, “Government’s attention has been drawn to the unfortunate burning of parts of Isiala Ngwa South Local Government Area Headquarters in the early hours of this morning by unknown arsonists. “It is pertinent to state that Government does not wish to expend public fund in rebuilding the burnt facility so as to serve as a stark reminder to those behind the arson of their folly”. Continuing, the Abia Government added, “Let it be stated clearly that if the intention of the arsonists was to hinder or stop today’s PDP LGA Chairmanship primary, they have failed abysmally as the primary will go ahead as scheduled. Government will not give in to the antics of destructive elements.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854364" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FB_IMG_1605175326667.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FB_IMG_1605175326667.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FB_IMG_1605175326667-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> “For the avoidance of doubt, Government wishes to state that no other development will be carried out in the affected LGA until the structure is restored. It, therefore, becomes the responsibility of all citizens particularly those of Isiala Ngwa South LGA to cooperate with law enforcement agents in their efforts to unravel the identity of those behind the unfortunate act”. Meanwhile, as at the time of filing this report, the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Abia State Command, SP Joeffrey Ogbonna could not be reached for comment over the ugly scenario.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-854368" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FB_IMG_1605175333218.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FB_IMG_1605175333218.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FB_IMG_1605175333218-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

Adefisoye represents Idanre/Ifedore Federal Constituency of Ondo State. “I can see everybody congratulating @JoeBiden. The man has been in Government almost all his life”, he tweeted on Sunday. “We never even use 2 years for Office, Una don Dey curse us as if na we start Nigeria’s problem. Give us time, encourage us and we will get there one day.” Earlier on Saturday, Adefisoye declared his support for United States President Donald Trump. “I stand with @realDonaldTrump & my support for him is total. I am prepared to swim or sink with him on this #Elections2020. “I know most people will prefer that I concentrate on Nigeria issues but we must realize that whatever affects the US is very likely to affect the world”, the politician wrote.

Former President, Goodluck Jonathan has disclosed how he brought “great peace” to Nigeria. Jonathan disclosed that his philosophy of opting to leave power to gain honour had brought peace to Nigeria and himself. The former president disclosed this in a post on his Facebook page, on Friday. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had defeated Jonathan during the 2015 presidential election. Despite being the incumbent president at the time, Jonathan had conceded power to Buhari, stressing that nobody’s presidential election was worth the blood of any Nigerian. However, Jonathan urged leaders facing election challenges to adopt his philosophy. According to him, leaders should always embrace peace ahead of power. He wrote: “Nobody’s ambition is worth the blood of any citizen. It is better to gain honour at the cost of losing power than to gain power at the cost of losing honour. “At any point in time, the power of love should matter more than the love of power. “This is my philosophy. I have lived it. It has brought great peace to both my beloved nation and I. And I recommend it to all leaders facing challenging situations, either in government, or at the polls, or even in their dealings with fellow political actors.”

Security agencies among whom are soldiers, Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) and Warders have beefed up security around the Ibadan Correctional centre. DAILY POST gathered that the Ibadan Correctional centre which houses the Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) Oyo State Command is located at Agodi gate in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital. Our correspondent recalls that a clash occurred among members of the armed squad of the NCS and some motorcyclists on Tuesday. Our correspondent gathered that during the clash, a motorcyclist was shot. Some hoodlums also took advantage and set a police station, Idi-Ogungun police station, ablaze. Our correspondent who visited the scene of the incident Wednesday morning, reports that soldiers, NSCDS officials and Warders have beefed up security around the Correctional centre. DAILY POST gathered that the move was taken in order to prevent a possible jailbreak. An official of the NCS who asked not to be mentioned in the media told DAILY POST that some hoodlums attempted to enter the Correctional centre on Tuesday. He noted that security agents who were drafted to the area prevented the hoodlums from gaining entrance. The source added that this made the authorities to beef up security around the facility. “Yesterday, those people wanted to enter the prison. They did not come through this entrance, they came through the back. But, we thank God, they did not enter. “Everything has been normalized but security agents are everywhere here. You can see them, the army, the Civil Defense and others”. All efforts by DAILY POST to get the reaction of the spokesman of the NCS, Oyo State Command, Mr. Olanrewaju Anjorin proved abortive as several calls put through to his telephone line were not answered.

This is the second time the church, Christain Universal Church International at 25, Azikiwe Street Mile 3-Diobu, Port Harcourt will be attacked under one Month. The Church was first attacked by a set of hoodlums during the heat of the violent EndSARS protest in Rivers State. And the National Leader of BNL, Princewill Chimezie Richard, in a statement to DAILY POST, stated that innocent people ought not die because of one man. He commended youths of the town for their smartness in apprehending the attackers. BNL also urged the police to reveal the identity of the arrested persons and their confession to the public. “Whatever the motive of these criminals are, attacking a church is evil, innocent people shouldn’t go down because of one man,” the group added.

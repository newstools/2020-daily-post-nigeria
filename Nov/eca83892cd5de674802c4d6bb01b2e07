Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola may make a number of changes with the crucial game against Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool around the corner. The Citizens could hand UEFA Champions League debut to Nathan Ake when they face up with Olympiacos. The Dutch center back was absent for the win against FC Porto and French side Olympic Marseille owing to injury. And he has not played for City since their win against Arsenal. Ake teamed up with Guardiola at the pre-match press conference. And he could come in to replace Aymeric Laporte in the line-up while City manager aims to reserve his reliable defence stalwart for the weekend fixture against Liverpool. Kyle Walker continued his top quality showing in the win against Sheffield United. And he is likely to keep his place at right back while Joao Cancelo could be rested with Oleksandr Zinchenko replacing him in the City side. In midfield, Rodri should keep his place as the midfield anchor and he could be partnered by Ikay Gundogan who’ve started every Champions League game for Manchester City last term. The Germany international could be joined by Phil Foden who impressed during his brief appearance against Sheffield. Guardiola’s attacking option are limited as a result of injuries to Sergio Aguero and Brazil star Gabriel Jesus. Prospect from the youth ranks Liam Delap could have featured but was granted permission to play in City’s FA Cup Youth Final against Chelsea on Monday night. And this could see Ferran Torres to be used as a centre forward owing his magnificent performance against Marseille. Bernardo Silva could join the top three alongside Raheem Sterling on the left thus leaving out Riyad Mahrez who struggled to get going against the Blades (Sheffield United). Manchester City Predicted Line-Up Against Olympiacos Ederson; Walker Kyle, Nathan Ake, Oleksandr Zinchenko; Rodri, Ikay Gundogan, Phil Foden; Raheem Sterling, Ferran Torres, Bernardo Silva.

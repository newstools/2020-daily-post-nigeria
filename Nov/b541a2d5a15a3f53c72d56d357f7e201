Kogi State Commissioner for Information and Communication, Kingsley Fanwo, says there is a deafening call for Governor Yahaya Bello to run for President in the 2023 election. Fanwo said this on his Twitter handle, even as he displayed a campaign poster for Yahaya Bello. In the campaign poster, Nigerians are being convinced to see Bello as a presidential material for 2023, capable of replacing President Muhammadu Buhari. His tweet read: “He wants a great Nigeria. Nigerians want a great Nigeria. He has done it in Kogi State. So we know the deafening calls will bring about a defining moment for our nation. We are THINKING NIGERIA. “ According to him, the Governor is a youth who wants a great Nigeria, respects gender equality and religion tolerance. “Kogi thought it was impossible until GYB is doing it. Nigeria will think it is impossible until it is done by PYB. We know nothing is impossible for our Lion hearts,” Fanwo added.

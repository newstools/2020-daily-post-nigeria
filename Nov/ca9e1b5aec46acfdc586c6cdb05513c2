Two Shari’a court judges in Zamfara State who were kidnapped on their way to the state from Maradi in Niger Republic have regained their freedom from bandits after paying two million naira ransom. The names of the kidnapped Shari’a court judges were given as Alhaji Salihu Abdulahi and one Shefiu Jangebe. Our correspondent gathered that the bandits had earlier demanded a ransom of twenty million for the release of the kidnapped victims, saying that the relations of the two Shari’a court judges could not afford to pay the amount. According to a relation of one of the victims, Mallam Hassan Samaru, after some weeks, the bandits started mounting pressure on the relations of the victims to come with a reasonable amount of money, not necessarily with the 20 million demanded as ransom. “We told them that we could afford only two million naira, which they accepted to collect and release the two judges,” Samaru added. Speaking further, Samaru explained that apart from the two judges, there were other seven people kidnapped that were released from the bandits’ captivity. He said that the seven were released after spending several millions of naira and the armed bandits refused to release them, saying that both the two judges and the seven other victims spent more than two months in their dens.

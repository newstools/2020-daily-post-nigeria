Former Manchester United and Bulgaria striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted some of the games that will be played this weekend. Saturday’s fixtures begin with champions Liverpool away to Brighton. Then Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City welcome struggling Burnley to The Etihad. Later in the day, Leeds United will clash with Everton. On Brighton vs Liverpool, Berbatov told BetFair: “Brighton got a massive result when beating Villa last weekend. I thought Liverpool would struggle against Leicester, as the champions were missing key players, but they won comfortably. They’ll win here again. Prediction: 0-2.” Berbatov also expects City to ease to victory against the Clarets at home. “City are 13th and need to pick up the pace as soon as possible if they’re going to win the title this season. A home match against Burnley is a good chance for Pep Guardiola’s men to do exactly that. Prediction: 3-0,” he added.

Petr Cech has said he is “100 per cent ready” to help Chelsea if he is called up, after he was included in their Premier League squad. Cech, who won four Premier League titles and the Champions League at Stamford Bridge, was a shock inclusion in Frank Lampard’s 25-man squad for the 2020/2021 season. The 38-year-old announced his retirement at the end of the 2018/2019 season and returned to Chelsea as a technical and performance advisor. However, Cech has been training with first-team goalkeepers Edouard Mendy and Kepa Arrizabalaga and says he is ready to step in if called upon this season. He told Telefoot: “It’s true that it would have been a professional error to do this if I wasn’t at Premier League level, but that’s not the way we work here. “I know I’m 100 per cent ready to help if needs be. I’m fit, and with the two months of training, I’ve seen I have the same quality. “Furthermore, I rested for a year without playing football. It really gave me energy, my body recovered after playing 20 years as a professional. “If the circumstances put me on the pitch, I’m ready.”

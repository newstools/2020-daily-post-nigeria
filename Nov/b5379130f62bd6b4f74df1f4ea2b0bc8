Liverpool striker, Mohamed Salah and Arsenal midfielder, Mohamed Elneny, have again tested positive for coronavirus. Their tests returned another positive test for COVID-19, the Egyptian Football Association (EFA) confirmed on Wednesday. Recall Salah tested positive for COVID-19 last Friday, on the eve of Egypt’s 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifier against Togo, while Elneny tested positive three days later. Salah will have to miss the visit from league leaders Leicester City on Sunday. He is also likely to be ruled out of Liverpool’s UEFA Champions League game against Atalanta next Wednesday. Elneny is expected to miss Arsenal’s trip to Leeds United on Sunday and their Europa League clash at Molde on Nov 26.

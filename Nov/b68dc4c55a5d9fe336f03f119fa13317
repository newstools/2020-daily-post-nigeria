The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has said government should put the same energy it put in getting the Aviation sector to work in Nigeria into the Educational sector. Dr Edor J. Edor, the ASUU Chairman of the University of Calabar said universities would reopen within one week, if the same energy put in the aviation sector is extended to Nigeria’s educational sector. Edor disclosed this in an interview with DAILY POST. According to Edor: “If government would put the same energy they put in the aviation sector into education, then schools would resume in the shortest possible time. “If government can put the same energy and commitment in the aviation sector that enable them and their children to travel to their schools abroad into Nigerian universities, then within one week, schools in Nigeria would reopen.” Edor accused the previous and present Nigerian governments of ignoring the country’s educational sector. He maintained that Nigerian elites are not interested in the education of the common man. “Not Buhari’s government alone, all successive regimes in Nigeria have ignored the education sector. “Even when we had a president who was himself a lecturer, things were not better. Successive regimes and the Nigerian elites have no interest in the education of Nigerians and the reason is simple, their children are not here. “They do not want the common man to be educated because education is power. Immediately the common man begins to know his or her right, these thieves and kleptomaniacs who find themselves in the position of power would become threatened because all Nigeria s would have known their right. “They are not interested in developing education, they are not,” he added.

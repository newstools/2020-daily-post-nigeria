Biden, in an address to the nation, said although ‘Democracy is messy”, he has no doubt he would be declared winner once all the votes were counted. “Democracy is sometimes messy. It sometimes requires a little patience. “We have no doubt that when the count is finished, Senator (Kamala) Harris and I will be declared the winners. “So, I demand that everyone stays calm. The process is working. The count is being completed and we’ll know very soon,” Biden added. Votes are still being counted in key swing states, including Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Alaska.

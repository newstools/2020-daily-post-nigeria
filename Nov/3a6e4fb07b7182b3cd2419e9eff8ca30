The Igbos in Nigeria Movement has thrown its weight behind the efforts of the Nigerian Army to ensure security in the Southeast. It commended the Army over the recent launch of Operation Crocodile VI in the Southeast and Cross River State. The group said the Operation Crocodile Smile VI was one of the best things to happen to the Southeast. A statement by the group’s National President, Ifeanyi Igwe, said the launch of the Operation was aimed at containing all threats in the Southeast. Igwe said: “It is indeed a statement of fact that the Nigerian Army has risen to the occasion in times too numerous to mention in addressing the various security challenges in the country. Consequently, the recent launch of Operation Crocodile Smile VI is a testament of the leadership acumen of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai. “We view the launch of Operation Crocodile Smile VI as one of the best things to happen to Southeast Nigeria as it is intended to ensure that all threats to peace in the region are adequately contained. “It is thus our considered opinion that Operation Crocodile Smile VI would indeed be a huge success given the past operations of the Nigerian Army in the South East region that have been highly successful due to the professionalism and dedication of officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army.”

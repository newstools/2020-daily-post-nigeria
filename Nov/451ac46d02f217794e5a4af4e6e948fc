England manager, Gareth Southgate, has recalled Phil Foden, for this monthâ€™s treble header. However, Mason Greenwood did not make the 29-man squad. The Three Lions will play a friendly with Republic of Ireland and a Nations League double header against Belgium and Iceland. Both Greenwood and Foden were sent home, after they snuck girls into the team hotel, breaking COVID-19 protocols in September. It is understood that Southgate decided to give them a punishment of missing one squad last month for the games with Denmark, Belgium and Wales. Foden is back in, but Greenwood is left out because of form, as United are going through a bad spell. Reece James is in even though he will serve a two-game ban and, despite Harry Maguire also having a one-game ban for being sent off, the Manchester United captain is also included. England squad Goalkeepers: Henderson, Pickford, Pope Defenders: Alexander-Arnold, Chilwell, Coady, Dier, Gomez, James, Keane, Maguire, Maitland-Niles, Mings, Saka, Trippier, Walker Midfielders: Foden, Henderson, Mount, Rice, Ward-Prowse, Winks Forwards: Abraham, Calvert-Lewin, Grealish, Kane, Rashford, Sancho, Sterling

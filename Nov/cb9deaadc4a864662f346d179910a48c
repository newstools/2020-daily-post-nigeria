Babatunde Fowler, former Chairman of the Federal Internal Revenue Service, FIRS, on Monday returned to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, for further questioning. Fowler was said to have reported at the Lagos State office of the EFCC over FIRS’s involvement in alleged financial misappropriation during his tenure. The sum of N9.2bn from Lagos Inland Revenue Service and Alpha Beta was said to have been traced to Fowler’s personal account. Recall that the EFCC had a few weeks ago invited Fowler for questioning over a N5bn fraud perpetrated in the agency under his watch.

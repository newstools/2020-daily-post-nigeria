China has finally given an official reaction on the United States presidential election. China congratulated Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on Friday. Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, said the country was aware the poll will eventually be decided in court. “We respect the choice of the American people. We extend congratulations to Biden and Harris. We understand the results of the U.S. election will be determined according to U.S. laws and procedures,” Reuters quoted Wenbin as saying. China and America under President Donald Trump seemed not to have the best relations. They repeatedly attacked each other on issues bordering on trade, foreign policies, human rights, and COVID-19. Trump many times accused China of causing the pandemic. The President maintains he won the November 3 election, not Biden.

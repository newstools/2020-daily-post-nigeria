Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi has described the recent End SARS protest as a lesson to federal and state authorities. He told President Muhammadu Buhari administration and state governments to come up with initiatives that would bring government nearer to the people. The Ojaja II made the call on Tuesday in Abuja at an emergency meeting of the National Council of Traditional Rulers of Nigeria, NAN reports. “It is very important for that gap to be bridged so that issues, experience in Nigeria recently will not reoccur. It is a lesson for every one of us and we must all work together to better the lots of the youths in this country,’’ Ogunwusi said. Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, sympathized with monarchs, businesses, and individuals over losses during the mayhem. The SFG told the traditional rulers that government awaits their recommendations for inclusion in plans and policies. Mustapha added that their closeness to the grassroots will help them proffer counsels that will reflect Nigerians’ desires and aspirations. “I urge you to include as part of your agenda for this meeting, discussions on the various challenges facing our nation and in particular, generate ideas and solutions to the consequences and lessons from the recent protests by the Nigerian youths”, he said. The Abuja meeting was attended by the Chairmen of 36 States Traditional Councils of Chiefs, including the Federal Capital Territory.

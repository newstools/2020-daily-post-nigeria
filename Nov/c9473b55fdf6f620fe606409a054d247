The FCT Chapter of Nigerian Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) has shut down activities at the Bwari Area Council Secretariat over non-implementation of the new minimum wage. Mr. Abdullahi Yahaya, FCT NULGE Secretary, in a statement on Monday in Bwari Abuja, directed its members to stay at home until their demands were met. Yahaya said that the union had earlier written a memo to the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) to intimate it of the union’s challenges and plans. “The union in its emergency meeting held on Oct. 28 deliberated on the issue of non- implementation of the new minimum wage, 20 months after. “We had earlier sent a reminder on Oct. 19 to remind the Honourable Minister of the FCT, Mr Bello Mohammed, on our stand of Oct. 31 if the minimum wage is not implemented. “In view of the foregoing, the union has agreed that the staff of the six area councils of the FCT and the non-teaching staff of the Local Education Authority (LEA) in the area council shall proceed on an indefinite strike from 1 a.m. on Nov. 1,’’ he said. NAN reports that the council secretariat was shut and members of the union prevented people from going into the building. Also, one of the council staff, who spoke to newsmen, said that the move was a welcome idea as so many families could not meet up with the price hike of goods and services. According to him, implementation of the new minimum wage will cushion the effect of COVID-19 on them.

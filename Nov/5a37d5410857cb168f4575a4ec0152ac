The All Progressives Congress (APC) formally accepted Senator Ishaku Abbo into the party on Thursday. The lawmaker was received at the APC national secretariat in Abuja. He was welcomed by Mai Mala Buni, Yobe State Governor and Chairman of the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC). The event was witnessed by Senate President Ahmad Lawan. Abbo, elected on the platform of the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party (PDP), is the Senator representing Adamawa North District in the National Assembly. He announced his intention to join the ruling APC on Wednesday. Also in November, Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, dumped the PDP for the APC. Earlier, former House of Representatives Speaker, Yakubu Dogara likewise decamped from the PDP to the APC. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-856501 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201126-WA0032-1-1024x680.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="491" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201126-WA0032-1-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201126-WA0032-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201126-WA0032-1.jpg 1072w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

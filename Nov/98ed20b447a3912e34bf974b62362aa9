The Lagos Police Command said it has arrested 750 suspected hoodlums during raids launched across the state on Sunday. The command stated that the raids were carried out simultaneously on identified black spots, believed to be the hideouts of criminals and hoodlums across the 14 Area Commands in Lagos State. The Command disclosed that the arrested suspects were found with incriminating items such as locally-made guns and life cartridges, charms, weed suspected to be Indian hemp, substances suspected to be cocaine and some items suspected to have been looted from various shopping outlets within the state during the recent End SARS violence. The police spokesperson, SP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, in a statement on Sunday, said the Lagos State Police command relaunched its Anti Crime Strategies to curb crimes and criminality across the state and to solidify the security architecture of the State. He noted that the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, ordered the police operatives to raid the identified black spots as he had earlier warned and directed police officers and men to move against lawlessness and criminality in Lagos as he affirmed the zeal of the command to sustain the operations even beyond the yuletide season. Odumosu has, however, directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of SCID, Panti, to commence discreet investigation on the arrested suspects for immediate prosecution. He also urged those whose items were looted during the recent End SARS violence to come to the Command headquarters to claim their items with prove of ownership.

Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Sunday, flagged off the reconstruction and upgrading of the Eti-Osa-Lekki-Epe Expressway. The growing real estate development on the axis caused frequent traffic snarls, with attendant effects on commuters and commerce. The governor, at the launch of the project at Eleko, acknowledged that the road leads to the Lekki Free Trade Zone and several thriving estates businesses, NAN reports. He said the highway, expected to last over 40 years, will connect the Regional Road under construction and the proposed Fourth Mainland Bridge. The 10 beneficiary communities are Eleko, Onose, Alatishe, Aiyeteju, Ajaganabe, Oko Orisan, Ilasan, Lekki Village, and Epe. The expressway will have a three-lane dual carriageway and a dedicated lane in each direction for trucks. There will be a rail path for future introduction of rail transport and weigh bridges for axle loading. The project will be done through direct labour, in two phases. The first will cover 18.75 kilometres from Eleko Junction to Epe-T-Junction. The second, to commence in 2021, will cover 26.7 kilometres from Abraham Adesanya Roundabout to Eleko Junction. Sanwo-Olu also listed the relocation of public utilities, provision of reinforced concrete drains, culverts and median barriers, reinforced concrete rigid pavement with road markings. Others are the “installation of weigh bridges on each side of the road, preservation of a rail line corridor within the 50-metre Right of Way, the provision of transverse and longitudinal service ducts and the provision of a crushed stone base course”. The Governor told the contractor, Cranburge Construction, to meet 20-month delivery date.

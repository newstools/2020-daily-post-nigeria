Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State on Sunday dismissed claims that palliatives meant to cushion the effect of COVID-19 pandemic were deliberately hoarded by state governors. Akeredolu, who is the Chairman of the Southwest Governors’ Forum disclosed that the insistence on official flag-off ceremony by the Coalition Against Covid-19 before the distribution was largely responsible for the delay in distributing the items to the people. Recall that during the End SARS protest which was said to have been hijacked, many warehouses where COVID-19 palliatives were stored were looted by hoodlums. According to the governor, Ondo State was saved from the looting spree due to the continuous distribution of the palliatives. Akeredolu was speaking at the Church service marking the 3rd Year Enthronement of the Bishop of Owo Diocese, Anglican Communion, Rt Revd. Dr.Stephen Fagbemi held at the All Saints Church, Idasen, Owo. He revealed that states where the palliatives were warehoused, were also waiting for the donation of the remaining items and flag-off by the CA-COVID-19. Meanwhile, on his re-election, Akeredolu described his victory at the October 10, governorship election as God’s project which no man can truncate. He assured that people of the state to be rest assured, saying that his re-election by the people of the State can not tampered with.

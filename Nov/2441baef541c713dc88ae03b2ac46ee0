Legal practitioners in the services of the Ondo State Government have threatened to embark on strike over alleged harsh working conditions by the Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu-led government. The threat by the lawyers to down tools is coming a few hours after doctors in the state commenced an indefinite strike over non-payment of four months salaries. The lawyers under the aegis of the Legal Officers Association of Nigeria, LOAN, Ondo State chapter on Monday staged a protest to the Governor’s Office, Alagbaka, Akure, the State Capital. While lamenting the alleged failure of the government to meet their financial demands among others, the LOAN members said they have been working under unfavourable conditions. The aggrieved lawyers armed with placards of various inscriptions chanted ”Legal officers lives matter”, “No to self-financing of government responsibilities”, “No to boarding of self-financing and also demanding that allowances due to them be paid.” Speaking on the development, Chairman of the Association, Mr Babatunde Falodun said the legal officers could no longer work without necessary allowances from the government. On his part, the Secretary of the Association, Mr Wale Bamisile pointed out that only two of the seventeen vehicles refurbished in the ministry of Justice were returned thereby making it difficult for them to attend court cases.

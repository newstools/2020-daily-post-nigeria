The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP), has asked the Presidency to apologize to Nigerians publicly over the remarks by President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide, Garba Shehu on Boko Haram killing of rice farmers in Borno State. DAILY POST recalls that Shehu had said those killed by Boko Haram in Zabarmari failed to get military clearance before going to the farm. Shehu, who stated this during an interview with BBC on Monday, said although he was not blaming the victims for the incident, the truth must be said. Reacting, SERAP, in a tweet via its Twitter handle on Monday, insisted that the right to life was a fundamental right. “We urge Nigerian authorities to publicly apologize for the statement by their spokesperson implying that the farmers killed in Borno state deserve to die because they “did not get military clearance before visiting their farms,” SERAP tweeted. “Right to life is a fundamental right.” Recall that Boko Haram had killed some farmers on rice fields at Zabarmari, in Jere Local Government of Borno State over the weekend. The terrorists beheaded the farmers on Saturday night in Zabarmari, less than 20 km from Maiduguri.

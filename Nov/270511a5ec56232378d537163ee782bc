The World Health Organisation, WHO, has disclosed that 28.5 billion dollars is urgently needed to finance the access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT). WHO explained that the Accelerator would ensure equitable and worldwide access to vaccines and other equipment to combat the pandemic, NAN reports. The Director-General of WHO, Tedros Ghebreyesus, disclosed this on Thursday while addressing the opening ceremony of the Paris Peace Forum. “We have two urgent requests for the international community: first, the aid accelerator will be no more than a noble gesture unless it is fully funded. “The current financing gap for the aid accelerator is 28.5 billion dollars, and 4.5 billion dollars is needed urgently to maintain momentum,” Tedros said.

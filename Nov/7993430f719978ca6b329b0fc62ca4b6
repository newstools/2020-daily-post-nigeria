Justice Ayo Salami, Chairman of the presidential judicial panel investigating Ibrahim Magu, former Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has provided a rundown of the trial. Salami said the suspended EFCC boss and 113 witnesses appeared and testified before the Commission. According to him, 46 petitions and memoranda were presented by individuals and organisations with complaints against the suspended Acting Chairman, EFCC or both. Justice Salami said this while presenting the report of the panel’s findings to President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja on Friday. Justice Salami disclosed that the Commission also embarked on a nationwide physical verification of recovered forfeited assets, comprising real estates, automobiles, vessels and non-cash assets. He commended the President for the initiative to dispose of all forfeited assets ”because of the poor condition of the assets we saw during our physical verification nationwide.” Noting that the four chairmen of EFCC since inception were from the police, the retired Justice of the Court of Appeal also recommended that “in appointing a new chairman consideration should be given to candidates from other law enforcement or security agencies or a core staff of the EFCC as provided in the EFCC establishment Act of 2004.” He expressed profound gratitude to the President for giving the Commission members a wonderful opportunity to serve the nation.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has called on Gareth Southgate to reveal managers who apply pressure on him, to withdraw their stars from playing for England. Mourinho’s comments come after Manchester City winger, Raheem Sterling, withdrew from the Three Lions squad earlier this week. But ahead of Saturday’s clash with Spurs, Pep Guardiola has confirmed he has returned to first-team training. Sterling also pulled out of the England squad in October, but was named in the starting XI for their first match after the international break, scoring the winner in the 1-0 victory over Arsenal. “Gareth Southgate, I read, supposedly told that some club managers put pressure on the players not to play for the national team,” said Mourinho. “And because of that he feels sometimes the need to call club managers to cool down the emotions and control a difficult situation for him. “I would like him to say who. I would like him to say which are the coaches who put pressure on the players not to play. “And I would like him to say which are the coaches that he calls and speaks on the phone with them. He has the right, the power to call the players he wants,” Mourinho told a press conference on Friday.

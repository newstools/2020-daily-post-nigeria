Egypt has unearthed scores of coffins at a major necropolis near Cairo, the capital. Tourism and Antiquities Minister, Khaled al-Anani confirmed that archaeologists found more than 100 human coffins and 40 funerary masks. Also found in Saqqara, close to the pyramid of King Djoser, were statues in three shafts The government said coffins have been closed for more than 2,500 years. The find is the second in 2020, Dpa reports. Egypt discovered 59 colourfully decorated ancient coffins in the same area in October. “Saqqara has shown only one per cent of what it has. If we continue our excavations, various human and animal tombs are expected to be found in it. It’s a very rich area,” al-Anani told the media. The minister said the artefacts date back to ancient Egypt’s Late Period and the Ptolemaic era. He disclosed that the collection will be put on show at the country’s main art galleries, including the Grand Egyptian Museum being built next to the Giza pyramids.

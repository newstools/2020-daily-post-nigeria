The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, on Thursday, expressed worry over the mental state of survivors of coronavirus in Nigeria. Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and Chairman of the taskforce, at the joint national briefing of the taskforce in Abuja, said that the PTF is following reports from researches around the world regarding the state of psychiatric health of survivors and has intensified plans for in-country response under the treatment and post-treatment regimes. “The PTF is still very much concerned about the mental health of survivors of the COVID-19 virus,” he said. Mustapha said monitoring the global situation would particularly help in the planning of trips. He warned that “the number of COVID-19 cases has been fluctuating recently and that is an indication that we are not out of the woods yet. “The cases in Lagos State where multiple infections were recorded in two schools are typical examples of the danger of reopening institutions without the required measures. “We must all rally round each other to stop this pandemic from destroying our lives and economy,” he added, Mustapha warned that now was the time to raise the tempo of not just our national response but also our preparedness for a new wave of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other epidemic for that matter. He further appealed to all Nigerians to come out for regular testing.

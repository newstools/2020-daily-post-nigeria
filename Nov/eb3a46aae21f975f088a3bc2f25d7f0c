A court in Georgia has thrown out a lawsuit by US President Donald Trumpâ€™s campaign team, asking that the county followed state laws on processing absentee ballots, according to Associated Press. Chatham County Superior Court Judge, James Bass, did not however give an explanation for his decision on Thursday, following a one-hour hearing. The county includes the heavily Democratic city of Savannah. The suit had raised concerns about 53 absentee ballots, which poll observers claimed were not part of an original batch of ballots. But County elections officials testified that all 53 ballots had been received on time. By flipping the northern battlegrounds of Michigan and Wisconsin, and also winning formerly pro-Trump Arizona, Biden reached 264 electoral votes against 214 so far for Trump. To reach 270, Biden hopes to add the six electoral votes from Nevada, where he had a small and shrinking lead, or the larger prizes of hard-fought Georgia or Pennsylvania.

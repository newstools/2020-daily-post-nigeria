Former world boxing champion, Mike Tyson, has admitted he smoked cannabis before he fought Roy Jones last weekend. There was no winner in the bizarre eight-round exhibition bout, as the judges ruled it a draw. Both Tyson and Jones were drug tested by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (VADA) beforehand. But cannabis was not included in the list of banned substances and 54-year-old Tyson took full advantage with a pre-fight blaze. He said: “Listen, I can’t stop smoking. “I smoked during fights. I just have to smoke. I’m sorry. I’m a smoker. “I smoke every day. I never stopped smoking.”

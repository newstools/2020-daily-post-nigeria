Folarin recalled that his contributions to the party and his electoral victory in 2019. “Baba’s last most crucial political assignment on earth was marked with monumental electoral victories as he delivered House of Assembly seats, House of Representatives seats and Oyo Central Senatorial seat to APC. He hosted peaceful, fruitful and rancor-free APC meetings. “He was an exemplary leader, considering his boldness, oratory prowess, bluntness, integrity and dexterity. I will miss Baba.

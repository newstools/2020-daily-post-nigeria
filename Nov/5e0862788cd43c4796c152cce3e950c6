The draw for the third round of this seasonâ€™s Emirates FA Cup will be conducted on Monday night. It will take place around 19:10 GMT before Canvey Island take on Boreham Wood in a game that guarantees another non-league side in round three. The Premier League and Championship clubs are among the 64 teams in the hat, with the matches to be played around the weekend of 9 and 10 January 2021. All the games will be decided by extra-time and penalties, if required, as there are no replays in the competition this season, in a bid to ease some of the pressure on the football calendar, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The finale is set to take place at the Wembley Stadium on 15 May 2021. The numbers for the full draw, containing all Premier League clubs, are as follows: 1 AFC Bournemouth 2 Arsenal 3 Aston Villa 4 Barnsley 5 Birmingham City 6 Blackburn Rovers 7 Brentford 8 Brighton & Hove Albion 9 Bristol City 10 Burnley 11 Cardiff City 12 Chelsea 13 Coventry City 14 Crystal Palace 15 Derby County 16 Everton 17 Fulham 18 Huddersfield Town 19 Leeds United 20 Leicester City 21 Liverpool 22 Luton Town 23 Manchester City 24 Manchester United 25 Middlesbrough 26 Millwall 27 Newcastle United 28 Norwich City 29 Nottingham Forest 30 Preston North End 31 Queens Park Rangers 32 Reading 33 Rotherham United 34 Sheffield United 35 Sheffield Wednesday 36 Southampton 37 Stoke City 38 Swansea City 39 Tottenham Hotspur 40 Watford 41 West Bromwich Albion 42 West Ham United 43 Wolverhampton Wanderers 44 Wycombe Wanderers 45 Stevenage 46 Blackpool 47 Tranmere Rovers 48 Crawley Town 49 Stockport County 50 Plymouth Argyle 51 Portsmouth 52 Cheltenham Town 53 Chorley 54 Morecambe 55 Shrewsbury Town 56 Mansfield Town 57 Newport County 58 Marine 59 Exeter City 60 Canvey Island or Boreham Wood 61 Doncaster Rovers 62 Milton Keynes Dons 63 Bristol Rovers 64 Oldham Athletic

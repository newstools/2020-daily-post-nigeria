The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Sunday attributed the impeachment of late Balarabe Musa in 1981 in Kaduna State to his refusal to allow corrupt establishment derail his administration. ASUU President, Professor Biodun Ogunyemi made this declaration in a release entitled “Balarabe Musa: The Exit of an Iconic Revolutionary.” DAILY POST recalls that Musa recently died in Kaduna. But, Ogunyemi while reacting said the union mourns the passing of an iconic revolutionary “who worked for the socialist transformation of the world’s most populous black nation, Nigeria” He said that Balarabe Musa’s “subscription to the socialist ideology of putting the welfare and well-being of the poor at the center of governance made him unpopular with the ruling class reactionary elements of his generation” He maintained that “status quo” politicians did much to distract “him (Musa) from his socialist pathway for the development of Kaduna State and Nigeria”. “ASUU has lost a great ally in Balarabe Musa’s death. He was a major source of inspiration for the consolidation of ASUU principles. He stood by the union all through the thick and thin of the 1980s and 1990s. He participated in activities at short notice. “And if to bid us farewell, Comrade Musa gave the last National Delegates Conference lecture of our Union at the Abubakar Tafawa Balewa University, Bauchi on the 4th May, 2018. Balarabe’s ideal of a socialist Nigeria would have been a model for Africa. “His departure is a challenge to the people’s radical movement in Nigeria to close ranks and unite the oppressed to form their own party; with the goal of fulfilling Balarabe’s vision of Nigeria as a free and united people living in a socialist country.”

Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has denied he fears for his future at the club if his team fails to beat Inter Milan in their must-win Champions League clash on Tuesday. Madrid are bottom of Group B with only one point, after losing 3-2 to Shakhtar Donetsk and drawing 2-2 with Borussia Monchengladbach in their first two fixtures. “No, I don’t think about that. I think positive. I think about tomorrow’s game. “We’re lucky to play in the Champions League tomorrow. That’s all we’ll focus on. The rest is inevitable, but all we can do is prepare well and give everything,” Zidane replied, when asked if his job is on the line in a pre-match news conference on Tuesday. Zidane guided Real Madrid to three consecutive Champions League trophies in his first spell in charge between 2016 and 2018. Since his return to the club in March 2019, however, the team have struggled in Europe.

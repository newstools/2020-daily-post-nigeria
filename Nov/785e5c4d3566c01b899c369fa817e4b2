Mrs Walida Isa, the Coordinator, National Youth Service Corps, Federal Capital Territory, has said that five prospective corps members have tested positive for COVID-19. She made this known on Monday in Abuja at the swearing-in of the 2020 Batch `B’ Stream 1 corps members. Isa, who did not reveal their names, said that 853 corps members were registered after they were tested for COVID-19. “The five that were positive were taken to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control for treatment. So they’re not among the number we registered,” Isa said. Recall that the 2020 Batch `B’ Stream 1A orientation resumed camping on Nov. 10 and a week was used to test the corps members on COVID-19 before registration.

The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, on Monday, said the victory of Joe Biden in the just concluded presidential election in the United States would have a positive impact on Nigeria. Yerima Shettima, National President of AYCF, said Biden’s victory would strengthen Nigeria’s democracy with other parts of the world. Shettima, who disclosed this in a chat with DAILY POST, recalled how Biden, a former US Vice President and his principal, Barack Obama played major roles in the emergence of Buhari’s government. According to the AYCF National President: “Biden’s victory is going to have a positive impact on Nigeria because when he was the Vice President, they played a major role in the emergence of Buhari’s government. “You will also recall that Obama’s government favoured Buhari’s government, so I’m of the view that the relationship between Nigeria and America would be more casual than it was in the past. To a large extent, it’s a positive result. “Buhari’s government did not actually enjoy the support of Trump’s government “We are looking forward to a very good working relationship and how democracy would be strengthened between Nigeria and other parts of the world.”

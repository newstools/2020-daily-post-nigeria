Students of Oyo State College of Education, Lanlate have raised the alarm over several attacks by dangerous animals. The students noted that dangerous animals have been attacking them due to the bushy and unkempt state of the institution’s environment. The students also protested against non-issuance of ID cards after being charged N3,000. The students in a statement signed by the Students Union Government (SUG) President, Muhammad Yusuf Olaitan, also called for the resignation of the Dean of the students affairs of the institution over alleged sexual harassment. The SUG President in the statement made available to DAILY POST on Monday, said, “Fellow Nigerian students, our college has been in existence for more than fifteen years, but, it has been badly managed in the greater part of these years. “Despite charging an outrageous sum of Three Thousand Naira (N3,000) cumulatively, the management has refused to issue any form of identification to students, exposing us to harassment and denying us scholarships opportunities. “In the twenty-first century, students are unable to check their results online and print course forms despite paying for this every semester. “We are required to pay Eight Thousand Naira (#8,000) in 100 level, and Three Thousand Naira in 200 and 300 level each, yet no noticeable development can be seen. “The school environment is bushy and unkempt with dangerous animal attacking students during lectures. “The Dean of Student Affairs who is expected to act as a father takes pleasure in having sexual relationships with female students and threatening to withhold student’s results “Fellow Nigeria Students, as we continue the protest tomorrow, I urge us to remain steadfast and peaceful. Our demand remains the immediate resignation of the Provost and Dean of Student Affairs”.

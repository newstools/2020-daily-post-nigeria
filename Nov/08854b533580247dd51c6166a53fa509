The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has condemned the increment in the pump price of petrol. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan described the reported increment as wicked and unbearable. Ologbondiyan said the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration should stop such inhuman act against Nigerians. In a tweet, the PDP spokesman wrote: “This further increase of pump price of petrol to N170+ is wicked and unbearable. “The @MBuhari administration must stop its inhuman acts against Nigerians.” Recall that the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC) had increased the ex-depot price of PMS. A litre has been jerked up to N155.17 per litre from N147.67. The new ex-depot price was contained in an internal memo with reference number PPMC/C/MK/003, dated November 11, 2020, and signed by Tijjani Ali. According to Ali, the change would take effect from November 13.

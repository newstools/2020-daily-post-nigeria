Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has hailed his side for confirming their place in the knockout stage of the Champions League with two games to spare. Phil Foden’s first-half strike was enough to send City into the last 16. The former Premier League champions also maintained their 100 per cent record in the competition this season. It is the eighth year running City have reached the knockout stage, although they have fallen at the quarter-final stage in the past three seasons. “We’ve had an incredible group stage, especially the two games away. “We’ve already qualified and we’ll try to finish first. I know it looks easy, but it’s not. “Unfortunately we only scored one goal, but we attacked with more desire. The performance was top-class,” Guardiola told BT Sport.

Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has handed over his duties to an INEC National Commissioner, Air Vice Marshal Ahmed Muazu (rtd). He handed over on Monday at an event held at the headquarters of the Commission in Abuja. Yakubu handed over to Ahmed pending Senate confirmation of his reappointment by President Muhammadu Buhari. He said the commission was a constitutional body whose members were appointed for five years and which may be renewed for a second and final term. “This means that my tenure and that of the first set of five commissioners ends today,” he said.

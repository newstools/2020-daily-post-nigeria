Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has labelled his side’s defending in their 2-1 defeat by Istanbul Basaksehir as “unforgivable”. The Turkish side took a two-goal lead in the first half, before Anthony Martial pulled one back before the break. However, United failed to even level the scores in the second half. “The performance wasn’t good enough against a team that worked and ran,” Solskjaer told BT Sport. “They hit us on the break a couple of times and scored two goals like you sometimes do in Europe when you don’t defend well enough. “The first one we forget about the man up top and that’s unforgivable. The second one, we’re not very well organised to counter-press and win the ball back when we’re playing. So two tough goals to give away and then we didn’t have enough to come back second half.”

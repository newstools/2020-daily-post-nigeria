The tweet on votes theft by United States President Donald Trump has been restricted. Twitter took the action after the President claimed that some persons were trying to steal the election. “We are up BIG, but they are trying to STEAL the Election. We will never let them do it. Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed!” he tweeted. Twitter has prevented users from commenting, liking or retweeting. “Some or all of the content shared in this Tweet is disputed and might be misleading about an election or other civic process”, a message read. The social media platform attached a link directing users to its Civic Integrity Policy. The policy warns against usage of the platform to interfere in elections or other civic processes. “We placed a warning on a Tweet from @realDonaldTrump for making a potentially misleading claim about an election. This action is in line with our Civic Integrity Policy,” Twitter said. Twitter and Facebook had announced that they would flag posts that make claims about the elections or results.

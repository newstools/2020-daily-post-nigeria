Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has backed Harry Kane and Son Heung-min to break a Premier League record he set with Didier Drogba. Lampard and Droga formed one of the most potent partnerships, combining to score a record 36 goals during their playing days with the Blues. Spurs stars Kane and Son are on course to break that record and have already scored from each other’s assists 29 times. Ahead of Chelsea’s clash with Tottenham on Sunday, Lampard admitted it was a real possibility his and Drogba’s record could be broken. “They are certainly a threat to that record,” Lampard said. “They are going to beat that comfortably, with the way they’re going. “Fair play, I’ve got no qualms about that. It’s something me and Didier were proud of but this is football and it moves on.”

The President of the carnival, Prince Edwin Ochai, noted that the decision to tone down this year’s carnival activities was a painful one which was done after due consultation with various stakeholders of the annual event. He said “the COVID-19 pandemic has seriously affected every sector of the economy including the entertainment industry.”
Prince Ochai further observed that, “it will be insensitive to go ahead with the usual fanfare, the glitz and glamour to mark the Idoma International Carnival.”<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853890" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201108-WA0047.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="638" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201108-WA0047.jpg 960w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201108-WA0047-300x199.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"> The carnival CEO further explained that activities such as street party, road shows, beauty pageant and other activities associated with the carnival shall not feature in the 2020 edition.

Six hotels and four commercial banks have been shut down by the Oyo State government. Also sealed by the State government are seven companies and three petrol stations. The government said that the sealed properties were shut on Thursday for defaulting in the payment of the State’s land use charges. The government claimed that in line with Oyo State government’s Land Use Charge revenue demand bill, the State enforcement team sealed off these properties that have failed to pay the required taxes. Chairman of the state Board of Internal Revenue, Mr. John Adeleke said the exercise was targeted at ensuring that businesses live alive to their responsibilities. Adeleke noted that this will enable government to provide security, infrastructure and other essentials services. The chairman said the State government has given, as palliative, an additional 10% discount to complement the initial 25% discount on all taxes. Adeleke added that this is to ensure that the businesses stay afloat in the face of economic realities posed by the COVID-19 scourge. He added that the Government was poised to generate all taxes from business owners without any inimical effect on their ventures. Adeleke maintained that the enforcement would continue till the end of the year. He said, “The focus of the drive is not to close down or ground any business but to give a push to businesses to assist government in creating a better business premise for them to thrive.”

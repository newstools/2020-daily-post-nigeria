Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has admitted his time away from the club when he is playing with the France national team is a “breath of fresh air.” In an interview with RTL on Sunday, Pogba said he was going through the toughest period of his career at the moment at Old Trafford. After being dropped to the bench in five of United’s last seven games in all competitions and facing criticisms in England, Pogba gave a fine display on Saturday in France’s 1-0 win against Portugal. Talking about his difficult time in Manchester, he said: “It is a period that I had never experienced in my career before, where I usually always play and always have the rhythm. “And suddenly that changes. Little by little, I get my sensations back. I am finding myself again. “This is what I have to do all the time and be consistent.”

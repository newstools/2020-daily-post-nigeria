The Chief of Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, has maintained that the Nigerian Army was professional in its conduct. Buratai made the remark in response to a report by CNN on the shooting of End SARS protesters at Lekki toll gate in Lagos State. Recall that soldiers deployed to Lekki toll gate were accused of shooting and killing End SARS protesters at Lekki toll gate. But, the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army had denied killing protesters at Lekki toll gate. However, CNN had released an investigative report showing how soldiers had shot at protesters on the fateful day. Reacting to the report, Buratai said the Nigerian Army will never operate outside the rules of engagement. He spoke while receiving members of the House of Representatives committee on Army at the Army headquarters on Wednesday. According to Buratai: “Let me assure you and all Nigerians that the Nigerian Army is a professional Army. We follow our rules of engagement. Nigerians should feel safe. “We abide by rules of engagement and the constitution of the federal republic of Nigeria.”

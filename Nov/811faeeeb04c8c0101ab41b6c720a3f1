Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, met with President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday. Umahi was at the Presidential Villa with some All Progressives Congress (APC) stalwarts after announcing his exit from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). APC Caretaker Chairman and Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni formally presented him to Buhari. In attendance were former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, Govenors Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa), among others. Hours earlier, the governor told his supporters not to castigate federal legislators and others who did not defect with him. National Assembly members of Ebonyi origin had distanced themselves from his desertion. In Abakaliki during his official declaration, Umahi stated that Ebonyi is now 99.9 per cent APC. He said the remaining 0.1 percent are PDP and predicted that those still in the opposition will eventually decamp. “Do not castigate them because they are looking for something and will come back when they get it. They are my children and I love them very much as the father of the state,” he said in reference to the lawmakers and other non-defectors. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-855541" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FB_IMG_1605827758579.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FB_IMG_1605827758579.jpg 960w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FB_IMG_1605827758579-300x200.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"> The governor thanked his appointees and supporters for believing in him.

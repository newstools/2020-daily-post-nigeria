The federal government on Saturday ordered owners of trailers at Ogere section of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway to remove the articulated vehicles. Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, said ongoing construction works would commence in the area shortly. He gave the directive during a town hall meeting with stakeholders at Ogere in Ogun State after inspecting the road from Lagos. In attendance were traditional rulers, representatives of the major tribes, civil society, state government officials, contractors and traffic regulatory agencies. “My appeal to you (articulated vehicles) is for you to leave the road today immediately,” NAN quoted him as saying. The minister told the task force on traffic laws newly constituted by Ogun State Government to enforce the directive. He stressed that parking on the highway was a violation of the laws. Fashola insisted that operators were supposed to provide parking spaces for their fleet, adding that government’s construction of truck parks was to support them. He condemned truck drivers for pouring diesel and petrol on the highway, causing road degeneration. Julius Berger and RCC, contractors handling sections one and two of the Lagos-Ibadan expressway project, made presentations. The firms also gave statistics many Nigerians would find interesting. They said 400,000 vehicles plied the road daily; 3,000 per hour. The expressway is regarded as the busiest in the country.

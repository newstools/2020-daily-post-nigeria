The Awgu Local Government Council Chairman, Hon. Pedro Nwankwo said on Thursday that a billboard erected in Awgu mourning the victims of a recent road accident was neither approved by him nor reflected his mood in respect to the sad incident. Although he stated that the billboard was mounted by a supporter in solidarity with the state government and families of the pupils and staff of the Presentation Nursery and Primary School, Awgu, who died in the fatal accident, he disclosed also that the photograph used in the billboard was not approved by him. Reacting to the development which has attracted public concerns on social media, Hon. Nwankwo stated that he had directed immediate removal of the billboard, even as he appreciated the public for the concerns shown on the issue. He said: “My attention has been drawn to the misrepresentation of facts as being peddled on social media concerning a billboard erected in Awgu Local Government Area of Enugu State, over a month ago, by one of our supporters, in solidarity with the government and families of the pupils and staff of Presentation Primary and Nursing School, Awgu, who died in a fatal road accident in my council area. “As we still mourn these innocent souls painfully, I wish to state categorically that the photograph of my person used in the said billboard by the concerned individual was not approved by me and consequently does not reflect my mood in respect of the sad tragedy, as being mischievously peddled on social media. “We sincerely appreciate public concern over this issue and I have directed that the billboard should be pulled down accordingly. “May I use this opportunity to once again thank our compassionate, caring, able and God fearing Governor of Enugu State, His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Dr. Ifeanyi Lawrence Ugwuanyi, for all he has done for the families of the victims, both survivors and the dead, the school and the Catholic Diocese of Awgu, to cushion the pains of the grievous loss.”

Deji Adeyanju, popular activist, on Tuesday, warned the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, against fielding Atiku Abubakar, former Vice President, as its 2023 presidential candidate. Adeyanju, who is the convener of the Concerned Nigerians Group, warned that PDP will be in opposition for eight more years if it fields Atiku as its presidential flag bearer in 2023. In a series of tweets, the activist also disclosed that the All Progressives Congress, APC, would present a young presidential candidate to deceive Nigerians. “PDP must present a new face in 2023 to stand any chance because APC will be presenting a YOUNG PERSON and it will be easier to deceive Nigerians again “If they allow Atiku to emerge, they will be in opposition for 8 more years. He should rest. The nation is tired of their set. “Many of you just analyze Nigerian politics based on emotions as if you don’t know this country again. The people that will start the betrayal are PDP members. Didn’t many PDP people including Governors work against Atiku the last time,” Adeyanju tweeted.

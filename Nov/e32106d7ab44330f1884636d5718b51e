The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti has hailed the judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja, in a case filed, by Femi Ojudu and other members. Ojudu is the Special Adviser to the President on Political Matters. The former Senator and some aggrieved chieftains had challenged constitution of Ekiti APC executive committee. The court dismissed the case on Thursday. APC called the development a victory that would deepen democracy in the State and the country. The spokesman, Ade Ajayi, said the party will not depart from its resolve to be a formidable force. “While the decision of the Federal High Court vindicates our stand that our Exco has always been overboard in all our dealings in the past, we shall remain committed in our determination to continue to rule Ekiti state. “We remain a family and indivisible one, a sign for the opposition to continue to remain dormant and lick its wounds for ever in Ekiti politics”, he noted.

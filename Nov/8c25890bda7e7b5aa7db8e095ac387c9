The Presidency has reacted to reports that repentant Boko Haram members will be paid N150,000 monthly. Reports emerged on social media that Nigerian government was making plans to pay Boko Haram repentant members N150,000 monthly. However, Bashir Ahmad, media aide to President Muhammadu Buhari described the report as false. He urged Nigerians to disregard the report. Ahmad on his Twitter page wrote: “FAKE NEWS ALERT: The Federal Government is NOT planning to start paying repented Boko Haram members N150,000 monthly. “The story is baseless and should be regarded as the usual fake news. When you see it here or on WhatsApp, ask the poster to provide a credible source of the story.”

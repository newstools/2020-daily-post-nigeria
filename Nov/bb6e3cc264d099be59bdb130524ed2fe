Popular Nollywood actress, Funke Akindele, has hinted on undergoing cosmetic surgery after she responded to a follower who warned her against undergoing any form of surgery on her body. According to the supposed prophet @Omoarukhejohn on Twitter, Lord told him that the actress would not survive cosmetic surgery if she tries it. The tweet read: “Funke Akindele. Good morning ma. Jesus loves you. Please don’t be offended. I have a message for you. “Do not undergo any surgery because the Lord said you will not make it. To obey is better than sacrifice 1sam. 15v22 and Jer. 7v23. God bless you as you obey.” However, Funke of the Jenifa fame, responded swiftly saying: “I don do am already. ( I have done surgery already).<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-855355" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/funke.png" alt="" width="526" height="197" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/funke.png 526w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/funke-300x112.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 526px) 100vw, 526px">

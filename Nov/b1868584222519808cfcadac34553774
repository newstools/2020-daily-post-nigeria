Emmanuel Ajomafuwe has demanded justice for himself and his late 20-year-old girlfriend, Adaobi Ifeanyi. He said they were both shot by a policeman during a traffic stop in Apapa, Lagos, on April 13, 2019. Ajomafuwe, 33, was injured but Adaobi passed away. The victim testified on Saturday before the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry for Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters. “I was stopped by the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) at Apapa. The policemen claimed that I was signalled to stop and I said I was not aware. Due to the argument, I was shot on the head by Insp. Dania Ojo while I was still inside the car. “Ojo also shot my girlfriend on her leg and stomach. I was lucky to survive while my girlfriend, Ada Ifeanyi, died in a hospital. The policemen ran away and left us to die. Three weeks after their arrest, they resumed duty on that same street. “The NPF swept the matter under the rug. I still face issues of sleeping at night without taking tablets. No condolence message or visit from the NPF till date. No bills were paid by the NPF as promised by the Commissioner of Police when the incident happened,” he said. The six policemen involved were Insp. Adamu Usman, Sgt. Kashim Tijani, Sgt. Lucky Akhigbe, Sgt. Paul Adeoye and Insp Dania Ojo. Ajomafuwe said a brain scan was conducted at Reddington Hospital, Lagos, where he was admitted, and that he had a medical checkup in Dubai due to sleep issues. Noting that he has not been the same mentally since the incident, the petitioner urged the panel to demand that Dania Ojo is punished and that NPF fulfils their promise and offsets his medical expenses. Joseph Eboseremem, NPF counsel, requested for an adjournment to cross-examine Ajomafuwe. The panel chairman, retired Justice Doris Okuwobi, adjourned until December 11 for cross-examination.

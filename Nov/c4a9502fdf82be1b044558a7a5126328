Tottenham manager, Jose Mourinho, has revealed the six teams that can win the Premier League this season. Spurs briefly went top of the table on Sunday after their 1-0 victory over West Brom, before they were replaced by Leicester City, who beat Wolves 1-0. Mourinho’s men have lost just once this term, with many considering them as serious title contenders. However, the Portuguese appeared to rule his side out of the race, by naming six teams he thinks are the most likely to go all the way. “The Premier League is the most difficult one to be, because in the Premier League you can do a good season, can have lots of points, but in the end, Liverpool, Man City, Chelsea, Man United, Leicester, Arsenal. “So you can have a good season and not be champion. So what can we do? We go match after match. We try to win, we don’t care about the others,” Mourinho told Sky Sports.

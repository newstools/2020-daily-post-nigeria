Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila has admitted that Nigeria owes medical professionals for their dedication and patriotism. Gbajabiamila spoke on Sunday at a training organised for health workers by his office in Lagos. He said the programme was to improve their capacity to be able to handle the COVID-19 situation better. The lawmaker assured that the House was committed to increasing allocations to the health sector to improve the well-being of Nigerians. He paid glowing tributes to health workers across the country for their efforts since the outbreak of coronavirus. The Surulere representative said medics have shown exemplary courage and commitment. “Their efforts have renewed our faith in the human spirit and shown us that we are, each one of us, capable of extraordinary greatness, of courage beyond measure and goodness beyond what we imagine in ordinary times,” he said. “This moment also requires that governments at all levels continue to support the training, welfare and wellbeing of the medical professionals who are at the forefront of this existential battle. We owe them that much, and so much more,” he added. Gbajabiamila stressed that the House was determined to increasing appropriations to the health sector to remedy the weaknesses of infrastructure and capacity. He expressed delight that research work on vaccine for COVID-19 had reached an advanced stage. The Speaker said everyone must continue to act in the knowledge that the time when the vaccine will be perfect and readily available is still far. “When the final account of this moment is given, we will not forget to credit the health workers and medical professionals whom have helped us here in Nigeria, and others all over the world”, he added.

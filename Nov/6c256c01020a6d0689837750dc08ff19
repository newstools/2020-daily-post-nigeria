Following the slaughtering of 43 farmers by Boko Haram members in Borno State at the weekend, the leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has demanded the immediate resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari. The popular prophet described the beheading of the farmers by the terrorists as a sad occurrence and a confirmation that God is not happy with the present administration. Ayodele said that recent happenings in the country have shown beyond doubt that Buhari cannot lead the country any more; therefore, he should honourably resign. He maintained that Buhari needs to sack his service chiefs before the security in Nigeria can improve, while describing the present ones as ‘weak and tired’ “The killings that took place in Borno yesterday is sad, disheartening and shameful to our dear country,” the prophet said in a statement he made available to DAILY POST on Monday. “The stubbornness of President Buhari and not listening to advice has affected his government. He knows what to do to control it but it’s as if he has made up his mind to shed blood of Nigerians. God is not happy with this government because lots of blood has been sucked and there is no way the government won’t pay for it “This is sad, I’m sure the number is more than that, and that is why Buhari isn’t capable of leading this country again, he should resign honourably and let someone else who has the capacity to be there. He has failed Nigerians and there is no way God will be happy with him. How long will we continue to experience this? “The service chiefs are tired, they don’t know what to do, they are confused, they are just there making noise, they don’t have the stamina and idea. “My concern is Buhari has all it takes to do a positive thing about the security of the country but He has ignored the people, there is no peace, we have killings, armed robbery attacks, it’s a shame to the government, He should have resigned honourably and have peace of mind.”

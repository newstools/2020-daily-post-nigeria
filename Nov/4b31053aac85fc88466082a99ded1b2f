Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has taken a swipe on President Muhammadu Buhari led administration after the conviction of six Nigerians by an Abu Dhabi Federal Court of Appeal in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). DAILY POST had reported that the UAE federal court of Appeal sentenced Surajo Abubakar Muhammad and Saleh Yusuf Adamu to life imprisonment over alleged funding of Boko Haram. While Ibrahim Ali Alhassan, AbdurRahman Ado Musa, Bashir Ali Yusuf and Muhammad Ibrahim Isa, got ten years imprisonment each. https://dailypost.ng/2020/11/09/uae-convicts-6-nigerians-for-wiring-782000-to-boko-haram-fg-official-indicted/ Also, Court documents showed that between 2015 and 2016, the convicts were allegedly involved in cash transfers totalling $782,000.00 to Boko Haram. Reacting, Omokri in a post via his Twitter account on Monday blasted the President over his inability to do what the UAE accomplished. He also accused Buhari of freezing the accounts of peaceful End SARS protesters while he rehabilitated Boko Haram convicts. “The UAE froze Boko Haram sponsors’ accounts and sentenced them to prison. “Meanwhile, here in Nigeria, General Muhammadu Buhari freezes End SARS members accounts and seizes their passports, while he rehabilitates Boko Haram. “And you wonder why the youths are rebelling,” he said. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-853988 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6021-1024x854.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="617" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6021-1024x854.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6021-300x250.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_6021.jpg 1242w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

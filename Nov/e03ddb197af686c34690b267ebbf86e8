Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has brushed off speculations he could be sacked following a shock 2-1 defeat to Istanbul Basaksehir in the Champions League. The defeat on Wednesday, adds pressure to Solskjaer, after they lost 1-0 to Arsenal last weekend. Ahead of their trip to Everton in the Premier League, United sit in 15th place and are yet to win at Old Trafford. When asked if he could get sacked before that game, Solskjaer told a news conference: “I decline to comment on such a thing. “Of course it’s early on. Opinions are out there all the time. You’ve got to stay strong. I’m employed by the club to do a job, and I do that to the best of my ability with our staff.” Defeat to Istanbul Basaksehir, who had started the day bottom of Group H without a point or a goal, is United’s fourth in just 11 games this season.

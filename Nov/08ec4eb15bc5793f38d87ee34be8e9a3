Juventus manager, Andrea Pirlo, has left Cristiano Ronaldo for Saturday’s Serie A clash with Benevento. Ronaldo captained Portugal for all their three matches during the international break across a seven-day period in mid-November. The 35-year-old has also played in both of Juve’s subsequent games against Cagliari and Ferencvaros. Having played eight matches since the start of the month, he will play no part at the Stadio Ciro Vigorito, with Alvaro Morata and Paulo Dybala named in the travelling party as attacking options. “Cristiano Ronaldo will take an agreed rest session because he was a bit tired after so many games,” Pirlo told Juventus TV. “It was planned that he would not come to Benevento.”

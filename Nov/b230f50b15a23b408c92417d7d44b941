The Edo State Police Commissioner, Johnson Kokumo, has said that police officials will no longer fold their hands and allow criminals to kill them at will. Speaking during the inauguration of 70 vigilante groups in Ikopaba-Okha Local Government of the state on Monday Johnson, said that there is a justification to use their firearms when their lives are in danger. He however stated that it is the responsibility of the police to sanitize the state. Kokumo also said that the police have made a good number of arrests in connection with “all manner of crimes in the state.” He further disclosed that operatives of the force will be on 24 hours joint patrol with other security agencies in the local government. “We will keep talking to our officers not to police with bitterness. “But never again will it happen for someone carrying a jack-knife to kill a policeman carrying AK-47 riffle. “The police will no longer fold their hands and die like chicken. I want everyone to take the message home to neighbours and their children,” he said.

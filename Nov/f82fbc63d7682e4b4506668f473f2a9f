The Senior Pastor of Daystar Christian Centre, Sam Adeyemi, has reacted to the suit filed against him and others over their involvement in the EndSARS protests. An activist, Kenechukwu Okeke, also dragged Aisha Yesufu, Deji Adeyanju, Folarin Falana popularly known as Falz, Yemi Alade among others before the Federal Capital High Court in Abuja, FCT. Okeke instituted a criminal suit against the 50 people behind the EndSARS protests. He claimed that between October 28 and October 30, 2020 the defendants used their Twitter accounts to conspire amongst themselves to “commit misdemeanor, to wit promoting or acting in such a manner with intent to assist in the promotion of an unlawful assembly under the guise or composition of #EndSARS”. Okeke claimed that the offence was punishable under Section 97 (2) of the Penal Code Act, C53 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. However, in a light-hearted response, Pastor Adeyemi tweeted: “Who sent this guy to file this frivolous lawsuit?”

Joe Biden has cried out over the failure of the General Services Administration (GSA), to recognise him as President-elect GSA is the government agency tasked with beginning the transition process immediately after a presidential election in the US. Also, the Biden team has not been given access to classified security briefings and federal agencies. The team has also been denied the funding needed to ensure a smooth transition of power. Jen Psaki, Biden spokesperson said this development could affect Biden’s ability to govern. “You need real-time information to deal with crises of the moment,” she said, according to BBC. “It’s imperative that our team and our experts have that access,” she added. Biden defeated Trump in the tight race to White House but the incumbent has refused to accept the result citing election fraud and corruption. Trump has file a flurry of court cases challenging the Biden’s victory. He recently expressed hope of being declared winner of the election, saying results that would be announced next week would put him ahead of the Democratic Party candidate.

The Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, disclosed this on Thursday during his visit to the Ogun State Police Command.

While addressing officers of the command, Adamu urged them not to be demoralised by the attacks suffered during the protest. He charged them not to be afraid of carrying out their duties as a result of the criticisms against them, saying no society survives without the police. Adamu revealed that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration has taken various steps to reform the Nigerian police. According to him, “The government has approved an extension of health scheme to retired police personnel. The police salary structure has been reviewed upward, affecting all ranks.” He added further that plans have been concluded for the renovation of police barracks across the nation. In his words, the State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, said the IGP’s visit would re-awaken the dampened morale of the police officers in the state.

He added that the police in Ogun have since returned to their duty posts, saying it is their duty to protect lives and property.

Popular human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, has reacted to the defection of Ebonyi State Governor, Dave Umahi from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Adeyanju disclosed that Umahi defected to APC to pursue his presidential ambition but President Muhammadu Buhari will hand over to a Northerner. The convener of Concerned Nigerians described Umahi’s move as a joke. He, however, noted that Umahi would only get a Senatorial ticket. According to Adeyanju: “Ebonyi Gov going to APC to contest for President is not only a joke but madness taken too far. “They won’t give him more than a Senatorial ticket and also hide his corruption file. Buhari will give APC ticket for 2023 to a Northerner.” Umahi had defected to the APC over claims of PDP’s alleged marginalization of the Southeast.

A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Enugu State, Comrade Adolphus Ude, on Friday, hinted that many past members of the Enugu State House of Assembly are on their way to the party. Ude’s disclosure is coming barely 24 hours after Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State defected to the APC from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Umahi officially dumped the PDP on Thursday at a defection rally in Abakiliki, the Ebonyi State capital, attended by APC bigwigs from across the country. Addressing journalists in Enugu, Ude, who represented Dr. Ben Nwoye, the Enugu APC Chairman at Umahi’s defection rally, said discussion was at the conclusion stage for the defection of a number of former Enugu State House of Assembly members. Ude is the Enugu State Coordinator for President Muhammadu Buhari Solidarity Movement, as well as the chairman contact and mobilization committee, under the Nwoye-led Enugu APC. He told journalists that as one of the founding members, Southeast Mandate, led by Chief Julius Ucha, they were working round the clock to make the zone APC hub. “Nigerians have not seen anything yet as far as wave of defection is concerned in the Southeast. “Umahi has just opened the gate. In the next few weeks, you will see a tsunami at the grassroots here in Enugu State. “We are concluding talks for a mass defection of former lawmakers and former council chairmen in Enugu State. It is just a matter of days. “It is a good thing that our people have now come to terms that President Buhari means well for Ndigbo,” he stated. He called on those remaining in the PDP to make haste and join the moving train. Meanwhile, DAILY POST recalls that Enugu APC Chairman, Dr. Ben Nwoye had also declared that more Southeast governors and serving lawmakers were on their way to the party.

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has praised Reiss Nelson’s mentality following the player’s display in their 3-0 win over Molde in the Europa League on Thursday evening. Second-half goals from Nicolas Pepe, Nelson and Folarin Balogun ensured maximum points for the Gunners, who are now guaranteed a place in the knockout stage. Nelson, who was making only his third start of the season, delivered an impressive display against the Norwegian side. And Arteta has hailed the 20-year-old’s mentality after he rejected the chance to leave the Emirates on loan for a second time. “He’s made some big steps in the last month or so. He’s shown what he can do. “Again, he’s another player that wants to take you on all the time, he’s very vertical, he’s a great player when he runs in behind and he’s very unpredictable. I really like these types of players to play in the wide positions. “Defensively, there are things that he needs to do better and he will improve in that but he’s a much more mature player. “He showed a great attitude, in my opinion, to say that he didn’t want to leave on loan because he believes that he’s got a chance to play for this football club,” Arteta told BT Sport.

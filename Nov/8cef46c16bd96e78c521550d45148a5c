Nigerian music star, Tiwa Savage, at the weekend set social media on fire with some nude photos. The afrobeat queen dropped the photos on Sunday with the caption, “don’t swipe.” The photos have generated a lot of reactions from her followers on Instagram. While most of her celebrity friends hailed her, other Nigerians lambasted the 40-year-old singer for posting nude images. Notable among the reaction is Harry Song, who replied, “I no know say you get yansh like this, Tiwa.” @Thagreatjeffrey wrote, “Aunty, rest. Do you think (your son)Jam Jam will be proud of you like this?” @Obarojackson, “Tiwa, leave all these oyinbo people. You are no longer a little girl. At this age you suppose dey hide your body.” @Lekzy_Crane, “When will this one become responsible? At this your age? Which legacy you dey try give them your children?” @OdiaseFrancis, “If I talk my mind, they’ll say it’s African mentality, but where is the African culture that we need to past to the next generation. @TiwaSavage are you a African mother? I dey shame for you. #AfricaIsBleeding because no culture no #African. ” @Lagbenjo, “Now I hope we can see why social media regulation is needed. Our younger ones are on this street, yet this one is also a model to some of them. This ain’t our culture, period!” @xpense96, “She is living her life. Live yours.”

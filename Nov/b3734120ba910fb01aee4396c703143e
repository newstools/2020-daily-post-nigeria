A Magistrate court in Yaba, Lagos State, has granted bail to the embattled End SARS protester, Peter Eronmosele Adene. DAILY POST had reported that Onomene Adene, sister of End SARS frontliner, Eromosele Adene on Saturday narrated how the police deceived her before arresting her brother. Speaking in an interview on Channels Television, Onomene said she received a call on that day from someone who asked for their home address for a delivery since her fatherâ€™s church has been moved to another location. She also said that it was when they got to the police station that the security operatives said he was arrested in connection with the End SARS protest. However, on Tuesday, the court rejected the request by the police for an order to detain Eromosele for another 30 days to enable them conclude investigations into the allegations against the defendant. The court also granted him bail in the sum of One Million Naira, Channels reports.

An Ikeja Magistrate’s Court, on Tuesday, tried a 30-year-old trader, Onyendu Eze, for allegedly defiling his neighbour’s 14-year-old daughter.The prosecutor, ASP Bisi Ogunleye, told the court that the defendant, a resident of  Agege area of Lagos, committed the offence in September at his residence. He said that the defendant lured the teenager into his apartment and had unlawful carnal knowledge of her. “He called the girl into his room, bolted the door, forcefully removed her clothes and had sexual intercourse with her. He added that the girl raised the alarm after he eventually opened the door. “The matter was reported to the police, leading to the arrest of the defendant,” prosecutor narrated. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that defilement violates Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, and punishable with life imprisonment. The magistrate, Mrs Ejiro Kubeinje, who did not take the defendant’s plea, directed the prosecutor to duplicate the file and send it to the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions for advice. Kubeinje adjourned the case to Dec. 8 for hearing and directed that the suspect be remanded at the Kirikiri Correctional Centre in Lagos on Tuesday.

Popular Nollywood actress and wife of Banky W, Adesua Etomi-Wellington on Tuesday slammed social media aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, Lauretta Onochie for sharing a picture of kids using cardboard papers as face masks. Onochie posted the picture on her Twitter page as she beckoned on Nigerians to ensure they wear facemasks. Alongside the picture, she wrote, ”Wearing a mask is not a political statement, it’s not punishment by government. Protect yourself, Wear one. These have made efforts with masking where those of us who are more vulnerable and susceptible to COVID-19 are still swearing that it’s a scam. God bless their efforts”. Adesua disappointed at the photo of the little children called Onochie a disgrace both ‘home and abroad’ Her tweet read: ”You are a disgrace. Both home and abroad. You should be ashamed that these children have to do this with cardboard. “Instead of talking about how to tackle poverty so that they can be protected adequately against the virus, you are spewing this nonsense. Adesuwa stressed that the picture made her so angry, ”brought tears to my eyes and finally proved to me that some persons are dead on the inside.” “They are so small, so vulnerable and so unprotected. Arghhhhhh. THIS COUNTRY. “I am finally accepting the fact that some human beings, really are dead on the inside. Didn’t understand how that could even be possible. I’m realizing every day that it is.,” her tweet added.

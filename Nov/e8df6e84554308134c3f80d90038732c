Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, has declared that the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, cannot speak for the people of the southeast. Umahi, who is the Chairman of the South East Governors’ Forum, said IPOB can’t represent the interest of the Ndigbo. He spoke during a visit of Southeast governors to their counterpart in Rivers State, Nyesom Wike in Port Harcourt, on Tuesday. According to Umahi: “We, Ndigbo, we do not support criminalities. Do not buy into any criminal that is from our side. I find it very funny when somebody is going to be claiming that part of Benue State must descend into his territory and part of Rivers State must descend into his territory. What sort of madness is that? “Even if there is a referendum, people must freely say where they want to belong to. You can’t force them. No matter the history you have, you can’t force people to belong to where you want them to belong. They want to belong to where they want to belong. “Why I am telling you this is that we should be wise not to support what is wrong. Let’s go back and tell ourselves the truth. What is happening cannot be said to be for Ndigbo. Those people are not speaking for us. What are you agitating for and you are destroying the properties of Ndigbo? Won’t that tell you that they are looking for something?” Members of IPOB had allegedly engaged security operatives, a situation that led to the killing of people in a place like Obigbo, Rivers State.

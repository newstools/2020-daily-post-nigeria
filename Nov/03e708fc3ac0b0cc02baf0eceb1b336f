US Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, has told President Donald Trump to pack his belongings and leave the White House. Biden said this while delivering his final speech in Ohio on Monday night, adding that Americans were tired of Trump’s leadership style. Biden repeated the core message of his campaign, reminding voters that Tuesday’s election was about the soul of America. The former Vice President said it was time for President Trump, candidate of the Republican party, to “pack his bags”, saying “we’re done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility.” The race is usually tight between the two leading political parties in Ohio. Trump, in 2016 won Hillary Clinton with more than eight points – currently, he has a 0.2% lead over Biden, according to an aggregate of polls by RealClearPolitics.

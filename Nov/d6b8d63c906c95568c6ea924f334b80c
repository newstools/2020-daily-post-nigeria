Drama ensued at the Ondo State House of Assembly on Thursday following the refusal of the leadership of the Assembly to allow four lawmakers to resume legislative duties despite court rulings. On Wednesday, the Court of Appeal sitting in Akure had dismissed the stay of execution suit filed by the Ondo State House of Assembly against the judgement of the High Court, reinstating the Deputy Speaker, Iroju Ogundeji and two suspended lawmakers (Hon. Wale Williams and Hon. Favour Tomomewo) as it described the suit as frivolous. Also on November 5, 2020, an Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure had quashed the indefinite suspension of the Deputy Minority Leader of Assembly, Tomide Akinribido. The four lawmakers, on Thursday were prevented by security operatives at the gate of the Assembly from gaining entrance into the complex of the Assembly. The incident was captured in a video recording where the lawmakers questioned the rationale behind the move. On July 8, 2020, the lawmakers were suspended indefinitely by the leadership of the Assembly over what was described as unparliamentary act. Recall that on August 28, 2020, an Akure High Court had quashed the suspension of the lawmakers after the Presiding Judge, Justice Ademola Bola described the suspension as illegal, null and void and of no effect. The lawmakers who are loyal to the embattled Deputy Governor of the State, Hon. Agboola Ajayi were among the nine lawmakers who refused to sign the impeachment notice against Ajayi who defected from the All Progressives Congress, APC.

An Abeokuta High Court on Wednesday sentenced a mechanic, Musiliu Owolabi, to death by hanging for killing his lover, Miss Afusat Idowu. Justice Mosunmola Dipeolu, the Chief Judge of Ogun State, convicted Owolabi on a count charge of murder. Dipeolu held that the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Owolabi, 39, was guilty as charged. She noted that murder contravened the provisions of Section 319 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun, 2006. Earlier, Mr James Mafe, the prosecution counsel, said the convict committed the offence on February 1, 2018, at Camp area of Abeokuta. Mafe explained that Owolabi took Afusat to a hotel for pleasure, adding that she complained of stomach aches shortly after. “The convict took her to his vehicle. “On his way, he noticed she was dead, and he secretly took the deceased to an uncompleted building, dug a shallow grave and buried her without disclosing to anybody. “The convict was arrested when a younger brother of the deceased went to a police station to complain that his sister, who told him she was going for a naming ceremony at Bode Olude area, never returned,” Mafe said. Mafe also said that during an investigation, the police discovered that Owolabi was the last person who spoke with the deceased. “On his arrest, he made a confessional statement to the police and took a police team where he buried his lover,” Mafe added. NAN reports that Owolabi was arraigned on November 12, 2019.

Despite the report that he is not from Ibadan, the Olubadan of Ibadan land, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji has installed a former gubernatorial aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Engineer Olasunkanmi Tegbe as Mogaji (Head of family). Tegbe who contested APC primary along with other stalwarts of the party in 2018 was installed as Mogaji of Oguntegbe family in Labo area of Ibadan. The installation, DAILY POST gathered is coming despite the controversy surrounding Tegbe’s indigineship. Our correspondent recalls that towards the APC primary in 2018, some indigines of Ibadan had raised the alarm, claiming Tegbe was from Delta State. But the Olubadan who described Tegbe as a “beloved son of Ibadan,” said that the installation has ended the controversy surrounding Tegbe’s indigineship. The monarch, while installing Tegbe alongside three other Mogajis on Monday, said, “Tegbe is our beloved son”. Three other Mogajis who were installed at the Popoyemoja palace of the Olubadan on Monday are Chief Isiaka Adeniyi Ojebode who was installed as Mogaji of Ile-Iwo family in Oja Oba, Chief Sikiru Adekola Olotu who was installed as Mogaji of Adesun/Adabanija and Chief Lukman Adeleke who was installed as Mogaji of Odeku in Bode area of Ibadan. Tegbe, while speaking noted that the installation has clearly ended the controversy surrounding his indigineship. He said, “My installation has revalidated the obvious, that the man who has his origin here is from Edo, Delta. We are revalidating the obvious about the serious allegations. “I am very grateful to the Olubadan and the entire Olubadan in council for honouring me; for installing me as Mogaji of Oguntegbe family in Labo Ibadan which further confirmed some of the things we have been doing in Ibadan. “This is just the beginning of the good things to come to my family and Ibadan land”.

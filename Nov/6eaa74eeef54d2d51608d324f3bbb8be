The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has admitted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will only retain power in 2023 if it fulfills its promises to Nigerians. Fashola stated this while speaking with newsmen in Abuja on Monday. According to him, people will vote any party that keeps to its promises, even if it has not performed a 100 percent. “Some governors have joined us, from where we think we could not get voters before. To retain power in 2023, certainly if we keep our promises, people will vote for us. It is that simple, that is politics. “If you do what you say you will do, even if you don’t do hundred percent and they see that you are making progress, they will even want you to finish what you started. “Our opposition parties ought to think better than us in order to defeat us. Right now they are not doing that and I won’t teach them how to do it,” Fashola said.

The All Progressives Congress, APC, on Monday, dismissed insinuations that the End SARS protest may affect the party’s presidential chances in 2023. APC’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, said the protests won’t affect the party’s chances of retaining power in 2023. Following the alleged killing of protesters across the country by security operatives, there are some insinuations that APC won’t be allowed to return to power in 2023. Some Nigerians on social media had urged Nigerians to vote out the APC, come 2023. However, Nabena in a brief chat with DAILY POST advised Nigerians against connecting the END SARS crisis with 2023 political activities. According to Nabena: “I don’t think so, how many people have been confirmed dead or their bodies in the mortuary based on the analysis and censors taken so far on the Lekki toll gate massacre? “You see, we also have to look at the political tune under this, everything must not be about politics though. Yes there was genuine demand for police reform but at this point, allowing politicians to come in with hoodlums to cause a crisis is the adverse effect of it. “The issue we should be looking at now is how government can reform the police completely; you know SARS is just a name.”

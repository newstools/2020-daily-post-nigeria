An Osun State High Court, on Thursday, sentenced one Rafiu Saheed, 44, to death by hanging for armed robbery. The convict was arraigned on November 30, 2017, before Justice Kudirat Akano on two counts bordering on attempted murder and armed robbery. Saheed was sentenced to death by hanging for attempting to murder one commercial motorcyclist, Olaniyi Olayinka by slitting his throat with a knife. Prosecution Counsel from the Ministry of Justice, Bankole Awoyemi told the court that the convict, on July 30, 2012, at Ile-Ife, contracted Olayinka for his service and asked him to take him to Ipetumodu to see his brother. Awoyemi said that on getting to Ipetumodu, Saheed’s brother was not around, hence, he instructed the commercial motorcyclist to take him back to Ife. The prosecutor further alleged that Saheed ripped the throat of Olayinka with a knife while returning to Ile-Ife. The offences were contrary to sections 6(b) and 1 (2)(a) of the Robbery and Firearms, 320 of the Criminal Code Law, Cap 34, Laws of Osun State, 2002 and Section 1(2) of the Robbery and Firearms (Special Provisions) Act, Cap R11 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 2004, respectively. Earlier, Saheed had pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him. While proving the case in the court, the prosecutor called two witnesses, including Sergeant Okeniyi Segun from Ipetumodu police division who revealed how the accused was arrested at Moore Police station before he was transferred back to Ipetumodu and also tendered Saheed’s confessional statement before the court. The accused’s counsel, Barr. Julie Olorunfemi of the Legal Aid Council pleaded to the court to temper justice with mercy. In her judgment, Justice Kudirat Akano affirmed that the prosecution has proved his case beyond doubt and hereby found the accused guilty of two counts preferred against him. She then sentenced Saheed to 14 years jail term on the count of attempted murder and death by hanging for armed robbery.

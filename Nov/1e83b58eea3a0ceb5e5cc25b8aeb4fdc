Former Arsenal captain, Cesc Fabregas, has spoken about the thoughts of players under Mikel Arteta at the club and claims they are “fascinated” by him. Arteta replaced Unai Emery at the Emirates in 2019, after two seasons working alongside Pep Guardiola at Manchester City. The Spaniard has managed to keep most of his squad on his side, with many stars on board with what he is trying to achieve, according to Fabregas. “They have a new project, I believe what Mikel [Arteta] is doing is nice,” Fabregas told the Daily Mail. “The players are fascinated by how he came in and changed the training ground, the methodology, how he prepares for games. “He makes it easier for his teams to understand how to attack, how to defend – I like his ideas, all I’m hearing is positive.”

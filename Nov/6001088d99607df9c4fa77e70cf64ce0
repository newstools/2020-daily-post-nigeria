The Minister of Youths and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, on Thursday, described the feat achieved by 31-year-old Oye Owolewa in the 2020 United States election as national pride. The minister made this known in a post on his official Twitter page. He wrote, “Congrats are in place for the 31-year-old Adeoye Owolewa for making Nigeria proud by being the first Nigerian to win a seat in the United States Congress.” Owolewa was on Tuesday elected as a shadow member of the US House of Representatives from the District of Columbia. This makes him the first Nigerian-American to achieve the milestone. Owolewa, an indigene of Kwara State was elected on the platform of the Democratic Party. Also, another Nigerian-American, 35-year-old Esther Agbaje, emerged victorious in the election after winning a legislative seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives.

The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum (AYCF) has debunked reports making the rounds that it demanded the arrest of veteran journalist, Dele Momodu for interviewing Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB. AYCF described the report as a “fake, malicious and injurious fabrication” from the pit of hell. Report emerged at the weekend that AYCF National President, Alhaji Yerima Shettima had demanded for the arrest of Momodu over his recent interview with Kanu. But in a media statement made available to DAILY POST by the group on Sunday, the AYCF said that “those spreading the fake news against our National Chairman have been doing so for quite some months now.” The group said it was certain the fake news were all politically-motivated and targeted at the good name its leader had built for decades as a fearless democrat The group noted that “the agenda of this shadowy group, which is bent on ridiculing the image and integrity of our National President, is to score cheap political points”. Legal Adviser of the group, Barrister Liman, who signed the statement, said he had already consulted widely with his associates on how best to take legal action against the group, once ongoing investigations were completed. The group added, “The AYCF’s National President, our own vocal Shettima Yerima has been one of the leading lights in the advocacy for restructuring and good governance. “He has also been an advocate of peace and dialogue and we wish to warn his detractors that their campaign of calumny will never change that.”

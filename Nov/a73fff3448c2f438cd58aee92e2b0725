Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has labelled Arsenal star, Nicolas Pepe’s conduct as “ridiculously stupid” after the Ivory Coast international was sent off in the Gunners’ Premier League 0-0 draw with Leeds United on Sunday. Pepe was handed just his second start for Arsenal in the Premier League but failed to take his chance. The 25-year-old head-butted Leeds forward, Ezgjan Alioski, leaving referee Antony Taylor no chance but to show him a red card following a VAR review. Reacting to the development, Ferdinand said that Pepe let down his Arsenal teammates and himself. According to him, the former Lille star is struggling at Emirates due to the pressure of his transfer fee. Ferdinand told the FIVE YouTube channel: “All you Arsenal fans who are always there and are quick to shout and laugh and smile and celebrate. “Listen, it’s good, that’s what football is about. Your emotions can go crazy. I’ve been there and done it. “Ole’s at the wheel”, that kind of stuff. “But you guys are struggling again, you can’t get over the line again. “Nicolas Pepe let you down, I don’t understand it. You’re a player who said before the international break that he wants to get back into the team, that he needs his chance and he’s not happy. “You get given your opportunity, and you do something so ridiculously stupid and get sent off. It doesn’t make sense. “You let your teammates down and yourself down.”

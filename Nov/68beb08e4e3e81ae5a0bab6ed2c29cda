A travel agent, Alao Ganiyu, is in trouble for failing to deliver on a job after he was fully paid. He appeared before a Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Kaduna for allegedly swindling a traveller of N1.7million. The police charged Ganiyu, 35, with criminal breach of trust, cheating and forgery. NAN reports that the defendant pleaded not guilty to all counts. The prosecutor, Sunday Baba, said the complainant, Lawal Salami, petitioned the Deputy Commissioner of Police, State Criminal and Investigation Department on October 25. The police inspector told the court that in 2019, Ganiyu promised to secure a visa to the Bahamas for Salami but converted N1.7million he collected to personal use. Baba said the defendant then gave forged visa and ticket to the complainant. Salami was turned back at the airport. The Magistrate, Aisha Danja, admitted Ganiyu to bail in the sum of N500,000, with two sureties in like sum. The sureties must be resident within the jurisdiction of the court with fixed residential addresses. The case was adjourned until November 25.

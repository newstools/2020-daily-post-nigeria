The family of late former President of Ghana, Jerry Rawlings, has alerted of scammers using fake social media accounts to solicit funds for his burial. In a Facebook statement, Zanetor Rawlings complained that some persons were claiming to be her or a representative. She warned that their sole aim was to defraud unsuspecting people. Zanetor is a member of Ghana Parliament for the Klottey Korle constituency. The lawmaker advised the public to be on the lookout and report to the police anybody who engages them on social media for donations towards Rawlings funeral arrangements. “The modus operandi of these criminals is to first engage the attention of unsuspecting people who genuinely wish to express their condolence to the MP, then they proceed to solicit for donations for the funeral arrangements.” The statement reminded all those engaged in such activities that impersonation is a crime, adding that anyone caught will be prosecuted. Rawlings, 73, was a military ruler before becoming the Ghana’s democratically elected president. He won the elections in 1992, 1996, and stepped down in 2001.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Thursday arraigned one Ibrahim Mohammed Ali before Justice S.I. Mark of the Federal High Court, Kano. He faces a six-count charge of money laundering. The defendant, who worked at Abshat Engineering Resources Limited, allegedly created ghost workers. Ali subsequently paid monthly salaries to the tune of N11,187,619 to different bank accounts he operated. When the company discovered the fraud, he tendered his resignation and fled with official documents. His offence contravenes section (15) (2) (d) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 (As Amended) and punishable under section 15 (3) of the same Act. The defendant pleaded ”not guilty” when the charge against him were read. Buhari Mohammed Balarabe, prosecution counsel, asked the court for a date for the commencement of trial. A. S. Bawa, defence counsel, prayed the court to grant Ali bail pending trial. Justice Mark adjourned the case to November 20, 2020 for hearing of the bail application. The judge ordered that Ali be remanded in EFCC custody.

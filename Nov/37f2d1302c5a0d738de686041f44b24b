Hussaina Salisu, a 54-year-old mother of 15 children has advised Nigerians to plan their families. The native of Zaria in Kaduna State said this would protect the future of their kids. Hussaina had her first child at age 14 and gave birth to all 15 over a period of 28 years. The woman has no record of multiple births. Her first child is 40 years, while the youngest is 12. Hussaina told NAN on Tuesday in Mararaba, Nasarawa State, where she resides, that her pregnancies and deliveries were never challenging. “The only challenge is raising the children. Most of them did not go to school. Some started, but dropped out. I had 13 of my 15 children alone and at home; only two were born in the hospital. “If I was as enlightened as I am now and had knowledge about family planning, I would not have found myself in this situation. Survival has become a herculean task. These children do not go to school, we cannot afford a decent meal”, she said. Now divorced, Hussaina told young married women, especially Northerners, to ensure child spacing. She said having only children one can cater for will reduce the pressure on parents. Hussaina had seven children from her first marriage, and eight with the second husband who returned to his first wife. She disclosed that some of her girls are now married, but none was able to get education before starting a family.

The Nigerian Army on Saturday denied accusations of going after celebrity disc jockey, Catherine Udeh, also known as ‘DJ Switch’, who had live-streamed the alleged shooting of unarmed End SARS protesters at Lekki Tollgate. There are unverified social media reports that DJ Switch has been granted asylum in Canada following alleged death threats over her involvement in the End SARS protest However, Brig.-Gen. Ahmed Taiwo, Commander of the 81, Military Intelligence Brigade, Victoria Island during his appearance before the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses and Other Matters said they were not after Switch or any of the End SARS protesters. “DJ Switch claimed the Army was looking for her. Nothing could be further from the truth. We have bigger fish to fry. That is, how to stabilise Lagos. “There is a lot of misinformation against the Nigerian Army, and when you produce facts debunking the misinformation, all you get is abuse on social media. “The social media campaign against the Nigerian Army has been wicked and atrocious in its dimension and filled with lies. “It is being conducted as if officers and men of the Nigerian Army are from the moon or Pluto. The Nigerian Army will never turn against its citizens,” Taiwo said.

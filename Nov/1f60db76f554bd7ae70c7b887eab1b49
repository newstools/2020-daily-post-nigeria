Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr, has said that his team will miss Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, ahead of Nigeria’s second leg Group L matchday four 2022 AFCON qualifier tie against Sierra Leone in Freetown on Tuesday. Rohr also said that the player that will replace Osimhen in the team would fight until the end of the match. Osimhen, who scored a goal in the reverse fixture last Friday in Edo State, dislocated his shoulder and had to return to his club Napoli. Speaking after the Super Eagles’ training session on Monday, Rohr said at his pre-match press conference, “We will miss Osimhen perhaps another change in the team but the players that will get the chance tomorrow will fight until the end of the match. “No injury except the one by Osimhen we will miss him, but other players are here to come in,” he said. Nigeria head to the game after playing a 4-4 draw against Sierra Leone in the first leg encounter in Benin City, Edo State last Friday. The match kick-off time is 5 pm.

Some motorcyclists on Tuesday clashed with some officers of Nigeria Correctional Service (NCS) in Ibadan, DAILY POST reports. Our correspondent gathered that the incident occurred Tuesday morning at the gate area of Ibadan. It occurred opposite the NCS yard located at Agodi gate. It was learnt that the clash erupted when some warders warned the motorcyclists plying the Iwo Road and Bashorun-Akobo road not to pack opposite the prison yard. The crisis erupted when the motorcyclists defied the warning. Sources informed DAILY POST that the warders used teargas canisters to scare the motorcyclists. A source who asked not to be named told DAILY POST that many shop owners and passersby ran for dear lives while the clash lasted. “We had to hurriedly close our shops, some of us ran away while some closed their shop while they were still inside the shops.”, a male shop owner at Agodi gate told DAILY POST. Public Relations Officer, Olanrewaju Anjorin, who confirmed the clash to DAILY POST, however, added that normalcy has returned to the area. Anjorin in a telephone conversation with DAILY POST said that men of Operation Burst, a joint security outfit set up by the Oyo State government has been stationed at the scene of the incident. He said, “There was a little misunderstanding between the officers and some Okada riders. “They normally pack at the entrance to the prison. We usually told them to move downward. “We did it the same way today and there was a little misunderstanding. “But, I can tell you that normalcy has returned. Nobody was shot and Operation Burst has been stationed there. Normalcy has returned to the place.”

Governor of Delta State, Ifeanyi Okowa has said there are no plans by his administration to stop pensions of former governors and their deputies.
Okowa said this while addressing newsmen on Wednesday in Asaba. On Tuesday, DAILY POST reported that Sanwo-Olu announced that a bill on the abrogation of pension for ex-governors in Lagos State would be sent to the House of Assembly in a few weeks for legislative approval. On the other hand, Okowa said his counterpart in Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, may have reasons to repeal theirs but there is an existing law in Delta state on pension for ex-governors and he does not intend to touch it. The Governor said, “There is an existing law in our State on what accrued to the governors and their deputies, that I do not want to touch. “We are not thinking in that direction, my counterpart in Lagos State may have reasons he wants the law repealed but we in Delta don’t want to go into that. “I don’t want to comment on the decision of the Lagos State Governor. Each state has the power to make a decision concerning its governance.”

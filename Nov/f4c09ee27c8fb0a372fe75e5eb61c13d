The District head of Mazaki in Atyap Chiefdom, Zangon Kataf local government area of Kaduna State, Mr Haruna Kuye and his son have been killed. They were murdered in the early hours of today, Tuesday, by unknown gunmen. The late District head’s wife and daughter were also attacked by the gunmen and are now receiving treatment in an undisclosed hospital. Recall that the Atyap Chiefdom and other parts of Southern Kaduna have witnessed a series of attacks by suspected Fulani herdsmen, leading to the loss of lives and the destruction of property. A source from the village said the attackers whose number could not be ascertained went straight to the late District head’s house, carried out their nefarious act and left the village. The source added that the sound of the sophisticated weapons scared the people away, as no one could dare go closer to the scene of the incident. He explained that, “After carrying out their mission which is best known to them, they started shooting sporadically to scare away the residents of the village.” He added that it was after the attack that security personnel came to the village.

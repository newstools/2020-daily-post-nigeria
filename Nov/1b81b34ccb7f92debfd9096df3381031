Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, has stated that his administration is determined to continue to empower youths of the state by engaging them in the growth and development plans for Abia. The Governor stated this on his official Twitter handle on Friday. According to him, the fresh graduates will be engaged to fix the challenges of road maintenance in all the 17 LGAs of the state, getting empowered in the process by equipping them “with the necessary tools including asphalt cutters, rollers, duty trucks and power packs to support night operations”. Ikpeazu also stated that the fresh graduates whom he praised for their “ingenuity and commitment” will be trained by engineers at the State ministry of works. He therefore called on qualified Abians to apply for the openings till 30th of November. “In Abia, we since recognised the need to tackle the twin problems of youth empowerment and sustainable road maintenance anchored on the ingenuity and commitment of Abia youths across the 17 LGAs. “In the first phase, we’re recruiting a team of fresh civil engineering graduates to head the various LG Road Maintenance Agencies. Each team will undergo tutelage under the engineers of our state ministry of works and will be equipped with the necessary tools including asphalt cutters, rollers, duty trucks and power packs to support night operations. “I hereby call on qualified Abia youths: engineers, surveyors, and those in other related disciplines, to apply for the openings through the ministry of works between now and the 30th of November! Umu Abia, let’s do it ourselves,” he said.

With two wins already for Arsenal in the Europa League, Mikel Arteta can afford to rest his big guns against Molde. The Londoners play host to Molde on Thursday and are widely expected to get the job done as a firm favourite. It would be the ideal time to feature fringe players thus giving them the space to prove a point ahead of Sunday’s clash with Aston Villa. Striker, Eddie Nketiah should lead the lines after getting a goal in the convincing 3-0 win over Dundalk. The promising striker has also started both of Arsenal’s Europa League games so far with Arsenal lethal (attacking) pair Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette all expected to get rest. Reiss Nelson who also scored in Arsenal’s Europa match last time is expected to join the front three in the company of winger Nicolas Pepe. Arsenal’s £75m signing may have lost his starting shirt in the side to Brazil’s Willian. But he will be aiming to make a statement against Molde on Thursday. Joe Willock and Egypt’s Mohamed Elneny are likely to partner Ainsley Maitland-Niles in the midfield while Cedric Soares could come in at wing-back. In defence, Sead Kolasinac may likely play alongside David Luiz and Shkodran Mustafi. The Brazilian (Luiz) should be available having recovered from a thigh injury he coped against Leicester City. Arteta could also play summer transfer acquisition in the person of Alex Runnarson in goal owing to his clean sheet against Dundalk last week. Arsenal will line up against Molde with Eddie Nketiah and Reiss Nelson all starting. See line-up below: Alex Runarsson; Shkodran Mustafi, David Luiz, Sead Kolasinac; Cedric Soares, Mohamed Elneny, Joe Hillock, Ainsley Maitland-Niles; Reiss Nelson, Nicolas Pepe, Eddie Nketiah.

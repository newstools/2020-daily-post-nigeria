Pastor Chris Oyakhilome of Believers Love World popularly known as Christ Embassy has said that US President, Donald Trump, is hated by many because of his support for Christians and the tenets of the Christian faith. Oyakhilome in a viral video said many are angry at Trump because he didn’t come for their sponsorship. According to the cleric, things will not be calm if Trump is out of office. ”There are those who think that Trump, the President of the United States, is hated by many Americans. He is not hated by many Americans. I want to tell you the truth. He is not hated, Trump is not the problem. They don’t hate Trump. They hate those that Trump seems to support. ”They are angry at Trump for supporting Christians. So the real ones they hate are you who are Christians. That is what the hatred of Trump is all about. It’s got nothing to do with Trump. ”Before he started giving his voice in support of Christians and before he started giving his voice in support of Israel, he was their darling, they loved him. But because he didn’t come for their sponsorship and they didn’t expect him to become President, they blamed the Christians for voting him into office and that is what they hate him for. ”If you are a Christian, better know this. Don’t think that if we just get Trump out of the way then everything will just calm. It will not be calm. They hate you and he seems to protect you, that is the problem.”he added. Meanwhile, Joe Biden emerged winner of the keenly contested election on Saturday after polling over 270 electoral college votes. Although the general elections ended on Tuesday, November 3, 2020, it took county officials 4 days to tally the ballots.

In Ogun State, about 320 new officers were said to have been arrested trained at the Police Training School, Iperu. The Commandant of the training school, Abdulsalam Razaq, said the new intakes were indigenes of the 20 local governments in Ogun. According to him, they would be deployed to their various local governments to assist the police in modern policing and to stem the spate of crimes in their communities. Rasaq disclosed that the special constables have been well trained on how best to perform police duties, intelligence gathering and respect for human rights. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-854576" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201113_151507.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1920" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201113_151507.jpg 1920w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201113_151507-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201113_151507-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201113_151507-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201113_151507-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_20201113_151507-80x80.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"> In his words, the parade reviewing officer, Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, urged the newly recruited officers to make good use of the trainings they have received some far.

Deji Adeyanju, Nigerian activist, has given reasons for the failure of Nigerian students to protest against the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. In a chat with DAILY POST, Adeyanju pointed out that protest is now a crime in the country. He cited the recent killing of End SARS protesters in some part of the country, precisely, the Lekki area of Lagos where soldiers were said to have opened fire on unarmed protesters. Responding to the question on why the students have been so calm in the face of the prolonged strike by lecturers, Adeyanju said, “Protest has become a crime in Nigeria. “You want the children to protest so that they will shoot them? Protest is now a crime. The students are afraid of dying. They don’t want to die like the End SARS protesters. “Or you want the Ministry in charge of thuggery to recruit thugs to attack the students? We are back to the days of Abacha. “Days of Abacha are here. In fact, the days of Abacha is more reformed than this thing you call democracy. “

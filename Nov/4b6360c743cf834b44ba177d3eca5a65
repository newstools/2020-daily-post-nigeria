United States President, Donald Trump, will demand recount of votes in Wisconsin. His campaign has confirmed that the Republican candidate in the election will “immediately do so”. Bill Stepien, Trump 2020 campaign manager made the announcement in a statement. Stepien said despite “ridiculous public polling used as a voter suppression tactic, Wisconsin has been a razor thin race as we always knew that it would be”. “There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties which raise serious doubts about the validity of the results. The President is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately do so”, he noted. The race between Trump and Democratic Party’s Joe Biden is too close to call.

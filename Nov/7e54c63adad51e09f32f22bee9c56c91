Ex-Manchester United captain, Roy Keane, has said a top-four finish is “out of reach” for his former side, following their 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men are yet to win at Old Trafford in the Premier League this season. United suffered their third defeat of the new campaign, after Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s second half penalty secured all three points for the Gunners. The result leaves United 15th in the Premier League with just seven points from six games. “I never thought for one minute they’ll be challenging Liverpool and Man City but the way they’ve started this, the top four even seems out of reach. “And at this early stage, sometimes you say, ‘there’s no need to panic’, but the results and the performances suggest they should be panicking because it’s not been good enough.”

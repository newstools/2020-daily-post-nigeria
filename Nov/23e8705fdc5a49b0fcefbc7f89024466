Abdulrasheed Maina’s surety, Senator Ali Ndume got on bail on Friday after five days in Kuje Correctional Centre. Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court, Abuja directed his release. The judge noted that the court exercised its discretionary powers based on Ndume’s conduct. Ndume’s temporary reprieve was on self-recognition after his legal team assured that the conditions would be met. His surety must be a responsible Nigerian, who resides in Abuja, own a landed property within the Federal Capital Territory with evidence of ownership, and would swear to affidavit of means, with two passport photographs. For Ndume, he must submit his passport to the chief registrar of the court pending hearing and determination of his appeal. The Senator must liaise with the court for records of proceedings on Maina’s trial and transmit the records within 10 days to the Court of Appeal. Ndume must also comply with Court of Appeal (Fast Track) Practice Directions 2013 and 2014. Ndume is in trouble for failing to produce Maina, former Chairman of the defunct Pension Reformed Task Team (PRTT). The Borno South lawmaker is appealing the November 18, 2020 ruling of the court which puts his bond at risk. Ndume may lose his N500million pledge or his Asokoro residence to the federal government. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is prosecuting Maina alongside his firm, Common Input Property and Investment Ltd, on a 12-count charge of operating fictitious bank accounts, corruption, and money laundering to the tune of N2billion

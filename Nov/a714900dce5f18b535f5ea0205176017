Popular American preacher, Paula White-chain’s prophecy about the winner of the November 3 presidential election is almost hitting the rocks. White-chain is President Donald Trump’s spiritual adviser and the chairperson of the evangelical advisory board in current administration. She had during the week, precisely on Wednesday lead prayers for Trump’s victory in US election. And during the prayer meeting at the City of Destiny that also had the presence of top government officials, White-Cain claimed that demonic people are working at a high level with demonic plans in the election. She, however, prayed and prophesied victory for Trump, adding that God was sending Angels from Africa and South America to give Trump victory. “You will give us victory, God. I hear the sound of an abundance of rain. I hear the sound of victory. I hear the sound of shouting and singing. I hear a sound of victory. The Lord says it is done. I hear victory! Victory! Victory!” White-Cain said. “Angels are being released right now. Angels are being dispatched right now. From Africa, from South America. Angelic reinforcement,” she said. But at the moment, Democrat Joe Biden leads the race as the winner of the contest for the White House becomes clearer. Biden is currently ahead of Trump with over 74 million votes after he took the lead on Friday in Pennsylvania and Georgia

The Cross River State House of Assembly has called on doctors in the state to call off their indefinite strike action. Speaking to DAILY POST on Tuesday, the Chairman, Committee on Health in the House, Ekpo Ekpo Bassey, lamented the recommencement of the strike action by members of Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) in the state. He humbly appealed to the striking doctors to please return to work in the interest of pregnant women, children, other vulnerable and the poor masses. “In as much as I share with the concerns and fears of doctors working in the state as a result of incessant kidnappings of our colleagues, I do not think prolonging the strike action even when our colleague has been released by his abductors, is in our overall interest. “Considering the present mood of the state that recently suffered from massive vandalization, lootings and widespread destruction of public and private properties by hoodlums and miscreants who hijacked the ENDSARS protest, it calls for sober reflections, rebuilding, and reconciliation. “I think the leadership of NMA should partner with the relevant agencies of government to step up efforts at safeguarding the lives of medical practitioners in the state. “These are trying times for all of us. It requires patience and understanding until we overcome these security challenges, I therefore, appeal once again for the immediate suspension of the strike action,” he added.

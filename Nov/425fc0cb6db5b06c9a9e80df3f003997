The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been ordered to prepare for a United States military strike against Iran. The attack may happen before President Donald Trump leaves the White House. Axios reports that the government instruction followed the expectation of “a very sensitive period” ahead of Joe Biden’s inauguration. Senior officials believe a U.S. battle would cause Iran to retaliate against Israel directly or through Tehran proxies in Syria, Gaza and Lebanon. New York Times had reported that Trump raised the possibility of attacking Iran’s uranium enrichment facility in Natanz in a meeting with his national security team. This was during a briefing on an International Atomic Energy Agency report about Iran’s stockpiles. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo raised concern about the regional escalation a strike would trigger. Trump agreed and is weighing all courses of action. Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz and his American counterpart Christopher Miller recently discussed Iran and Syria. Last week, Pompeo visited Jerusalem and Gulf countries to discuss Iran. He was in Abu Dhabi, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. In Doha, he held separate talks with United Arab Emirates Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, as well as Afghanistan and Taliban’s negotiators. “At each stop, Secretary Pompeo discussed the importance of Gulf unity for a peaceful and more prosperous world”, the State Department said. On Iran, officials on the top diplomat’s entourage told the media that “all options are on the table”.

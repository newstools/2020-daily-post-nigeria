The Abia State government has reacted to a report alleging that Governor Ikpeazu sends money to cyber cafes and political associates. A statement by the Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu, said Ikpeazu is above reproach in the management of Abia finances and the publication should be disregarded. The statement further disclosed how the Governor uses both local and foreign contractors to execute numerous projects in the State. It further stated that the patronage of indeginous contractors was due to Ikpeazu’s policy which anchors on his belief in the creativity of Nigerians. The statement further itemized several projects of the government.

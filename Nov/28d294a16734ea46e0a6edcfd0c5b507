President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday said that Nigeria and the Republic of Algeria can’t grow or develop in an insecure environment. Buhari also said that Nigeria would encourage and support every move towards enhancing economic cooperation between her and Algeria. The President gave the assurance when he received a special envoy of the Algerian President, Mr Sabri Boukadoum, at State House, Abuja, on Thursday. Buhari said projects like the Trans-Sahara road, international gas pipelines, and other areas of economic cooperation would be given adequate attention for the good of the people of the two countries. He stressed the need for peace, tranquillity and security in African countries, saying; “unless you secure your environment, you can’t manage it well. “We should all secure our countries, because if we don’t, what do we then bequeath to the next generation. We can’t grow or develop in an insecure environment,” Buhari said. Boukadoum, who is also Algeria’s Foreign Minister, said Nigeria was the pillar of Africa, and he had brought messages from his President, “so that we consult, and see what we can do together.”

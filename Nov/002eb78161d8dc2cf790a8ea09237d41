Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted some of the Premier League fixtures that will be played on Sunday. Southampton host United, before the clash of the weekend between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal will also welcome Wolverhampton Wanderers looking to win maximum points and climb up the table. On Southampton vs United, Berbatov told BetFair: “This will be a tough game for (Manchester) United. The Saints are doing really well and their success is going under the radar. But I think United can take an important three points here. Prediction: 1-2. The former Bulgaria international however thinks there will be a draw at Stamford Bridge, “It is third vs first at Stamford Bridge. Jose Mourinho will try to keep it tight and hit the Blues on the break. I think Chelsea can compete with them. I expect a draw. Prediction: 1-1,” he said. Berbatov is expecting Arsenal to sneak a narrow win at the Emirates. “I like Mikel Arteta’s approach to the game. But at the moment Arsenal are struggling, even though they have improved defensively. Wolves have not been at their best yet this season. Prediction: 1-0,” he added.

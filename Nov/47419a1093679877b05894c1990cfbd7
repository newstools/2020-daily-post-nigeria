Popular Nigerian rapper, Illbliss, on Saturday called out those responsible for the eight months strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. Illbliss said Karma would visit all those in the position of power who allowed ASUU strike to linger for eight months. The rapper was reacting to reports that ASUU may call off the ongoing strike, after the union’s latest meeting with the federal government. Nigerian government had on Friday proposed N70bn to lecturers as earned allowances and revitalization of universities. Amid this promise, reports emerged that the prolonged industrial action may be called off soon. Reacting, Illbliss lamented that Nigeria was in ruins for paying less attention to its educational sector. In a tweet, the rapper wrote: ”A country in ruins. A country with zero regards for education, took the Federal Government and ASUU eight months to call off a strike. “Do you realise how many productive months you condemned for these undergraduates? Shame on this country. May karma visit those in positions of power who let this happen.”

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has told the Premier League to reconsider allowing five substitutions per match. Five substitutions were permitted after lockdown in the 2019/2020 season, but top-flight clubs voted against extending the rule for the 2020/2021 campaign. The rule change aimed to decrease the burden on players during the hectic fixture schedule and was also implemented in the Champions League and Europa League. UEFA has also chosen to continue with five substitutions in European competition this season, while Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp have called for the rule to be reintroduced in the Premier League. Arteta has added his voice to the calls, insisting there could be “really bad news” for players unless action is taken. “I would strongly support [five substitutions in the Premier League]. “We are here to give the best possible show. We need the players. “They are the most important part of that. We have to protect them. It goes on and on and on. “We’re going to have some really bad news with players that we are not respecting,” Arteta said.

Two different gang leaders terrorizing Katsina State have surrendered their arms to the government. Spokesperson of the Command, SP Isah Gambo, confirmed this in a statement on Wednesday, November 4, disclosing that the gang leaders repented and surrendered ten AK 47 rifles after persistent pressure and actionable intelligence from the police. The two bandit leaders identified as Sale Turwa and Muhammed Sani Maidaji were presented before the Governor on Wednesday, by the State Commissioner of Police, CP Sanusi Buba. Meanwhile, Governor Masari, addressing reporters, urged the security agencies to be ruthless with bandits terrorizing the state and the neighbouring Kaduna and Zamfara States in an orgy of kidnapping for ransom, rape, arson and cattle rustling. Governor Masari, who spoke on Wednesday, when heads of security agencies in the state brought the two repentant bandit commanders, described the development as very significant milestone in the fight against banditry and other criminalities. The Governor urged the security operatives not to relent, but redouble their efforts in fighting the bandits until they are completely degraded and rendered permanently ineffective. “I’ve instructed the security operatives to deal ruthlessly with the bandits until they are rendered permanently ineffective. We are no longer going to negotiate with them, but if on their volition they decide to renounce their violent criminal ways and embrace peace, we are ready to listen to them,” Masari said. “Even then, they must surrender all the arms and ammunition in their possession, otherwise they remain enemies to be dealt with accordingly, as far as we are concerned. “Government is always ready to receive, forgive and rehabilitate repentant bandits, as long as they surrender all the arms and ammunition in their possession, but it is not up to us to romance them,” the governor added.

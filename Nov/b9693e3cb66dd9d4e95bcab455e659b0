Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has named Christian Pulisic, Kai Havertz and Thiago Silva as the players that will miss his side’s Premier League clash against Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon at St. James’ Park. According to Lampard, Pulisic is not fit for Newcastle clash, Havertz just started training on his own to get some fitness after he tested negative to COVID-19 two days ago, while Silva just returned from international break today. The Blues boss said this on Thursday during his pre-match press conference. Chelsea head to the match following a 4-1 victory against Sheffield United earlier this month before the international break. “Christian Pulisic is not fit for Newcastle, but he’s stepped up his training slowly,” Lampard said as quoted by Chelsea’s official website. “It’s been quite a problematic injury so we’ll stay cautious. “Kai Havertz is back. His isolation is over, and he tested negative two days ago, so he’s just started training on his own to get some of his fitness back after two weeks at home. “Thiago Silva has just landed and messaged me this afternoon so he probably won’t be going to Newcastle because of the length of his journey and timings.” The kick-off time is 1:30 pm.

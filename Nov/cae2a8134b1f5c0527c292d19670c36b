Political stakeholders in Abakaliki, the Ebonyi capital, have condemned Governor David Umahi’s sack of several appointees after his defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Umahi met President Muhammdu Buhari last week after dumping the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Alex Nnachi told the News Agency of Nigeria that the governor’s action was contradictory. “You do not force people to accept your decisions, instead you can woo them to your side,” he said. Samuel Ogodo warned that the development would cause antagonism. He noted that if Umahi was keen on moving Ebonyi forward, party affiliation should not matter. “He has given reasons for his defection but those he sacked have automatically become his enemies,” Ogodo said. (NAN) Also on Sunday, the Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) advised the House of Assembly to impeach Umahi.

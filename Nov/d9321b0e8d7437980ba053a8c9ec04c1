Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has included four youngsters as part of his travelling party to Norway for their Europa League clash this week. The Gunners head to Molde looking to repeat their 4-1 win when the sides met at the Emirates on November 5. Having won three from three in Group B, Arteta will consider shaking up his squad, ahead of a hectic run of fixtures. Amongst those with the travelling party were academy prospects Emile Smith Rowe, Folarin Balogun, Miguel Azeez and Ben Cottrell. Smith Rowe, 20, is yet to play since returning from a loan spell at Huddersfield. Striker Balogun looked set to leave after contract talks stalled, but it is understood talks have begun again. Meanwhile, midfield duo Azeez and Cottrell could get a chance, having been in strong form for the Under-23s so far this season. â€”

Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, has confirmed that he has already had a conversation with midfielder, Willian, about his decision to travel to Dubai during the International break despite the UK’s current lockdown restrictions. Arteta also said that Willian has been dealt with following the incident ahead of their Premier League clash with Leeds United on Sunday. Willian, who is said to have justified the trip by claiming he had image-rights-related business to take, is understood to have tested negative for COVID-19 on his return to London which means the Brazilian international could likely feature for Arsenal against Leeds. Speaking on the development during his pre-match press conference on Friday, Arteta told Arsenal’s official website: “We [Willian and I] had a conversation, and I explained what I expected. “There are a lot of personal factors at the moment, and as well from our side, we need to be in their shoes. A lot of players are having different issues, like any person out there, and sometimes they make decisions based on the needs of the moment, or what people are expecting from them. “Whether they are right or wrong, it’s a thing that we have to discuss. But it’s been dealt with in the right way so let’s move on.” —

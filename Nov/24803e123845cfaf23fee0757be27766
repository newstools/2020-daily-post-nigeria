The Governor of Zamfara State, Bello Matawalle, on Friday, said he was having very bad experiences in Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). While alleging that there is bad blood in the party, the governor confessed he was having problems with his PDP governor colleagues. Matawalle made the claims in a statement by his media aide, Zailani Bappa, while praising the Governor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, for his bold decision to leave the PDP for the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. He said the extent of bad blood in the PDP was one of the reasons Umahi defected to the APC. “If this trend of generating bad blood amongst us continues unabated, our great party will increasingly be on the receiving end as we move towards the election year, 2023,” he said “I’m having a very bad experience recently from some of my PDP governor colleagues which I still find very puzzling. “For instance, the South-South governors accusing me in the media are PDP Governors. “As PDP colleagues, I expected the governors to contact me first and find out my own side of the story before unleashing their venom in the media.”

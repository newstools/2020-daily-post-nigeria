Nigerians have been urged to embrace love and unity to stem insecurity in the country. The founder, God Miracle Success Ministry Worldwide, Prophetess, Oluwayemisi Ajiye who gave the advice, said lack of genuine love among the people was responsible for security and other challenges being faced by Nigeria. Ajiye stated that love of money, selfishness, hatred must be jettisoned for the country to witness perfect peace. Speaking in Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital during the 2020 thanksgiving ceremony of the church, she said there is need to seek God’s face in prayer for Nigeria to get over her myriads of challenges. “There is no genuine love and fear of God in the land. That is why insecurity is returning in form of kidnapping, banditry, armed robbery, ritual killings, assassination among others. ” To reverse the situation, we must fear God and love ourselves genuinely, live together in peace and unity. God cannot dwell in a place where there is confusion”. She called on Nigerian leaders and the citizenry to seek the face of God in prayers and abstain from saying nobody can achieve anything without God. “If we take these steps, things will change for better. Men of God should speak the truth. They should not tell people what God does not tell them because of fame, money and what to eat”.

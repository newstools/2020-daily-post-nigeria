US President Donald Trump is soliciting for funds to settle his election expenses. The President has set up a GoFundMe account tagged ‘election defence fund’ to solicit money. According to the UK Guardian, Trump spent a little more money than he had, seeking re-election. He spent to the tune of $1.6 billion which he now needs help in repaying.

It continues: “Please contribute ANY AMOUNT IMMEDIATELY to the Official Election Defense Fund and to increase your impact by 1,000%

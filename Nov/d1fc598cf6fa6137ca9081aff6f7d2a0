Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, has noted that youths in Nigeria are precious assets. His description comes amid public outcry over killing, assault, arrest and detention of youths across states. Excesses of security operatives, especially the police, brought about the End SARS protest. The AGF assured that the Buhari administration is committed to empowerment through various schemes and initiative. Malamiâ€™s comment was contained in a statement on Sunday by Umar Gwandu, his spokesman. The minister spoke in Birnin-Kebbi as part of outreach engagement with community leaders and youths. Malami said the federal government has introduced programmes to help young citizens utilize their talents and skills. He cited examples N-Power programs, planned recruitment of 774,000 youths, community policing, special loans for small and medium enterprises, among others. The Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) urged the youth to continue to be law abiding.

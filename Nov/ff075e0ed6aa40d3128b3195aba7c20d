A social activist, Jumu’ah Abiodun, has asked the Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, to resign for “misleading the world” after Lekki shooting during the End SARS protest. Soldiers opened fire the night of October 20 as demonstrators in Lagos called for an end to police brutality. In his reaction, Malami said hoodlums parading in military uniform might have attacked them. “You cannot rule out the possibility of perhaps hoodlums that set in to create a scene”, he claimed. In a statement on Tuesday, Abiodun said the Nigerian Army through the Commander 81 Military Intelligence Brigade, General Ahmed Taiwo, has admitted that troops took live and blank bullets to the toll plaza. The activist called Malami a disgrace to the country and his office. “He misinformed the world on Lekki shootings by military officers at peaceful #EndSARS protesters, it’s outrageous. In saner climes, he ought to have resigned by now.” Abiodun called on the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union to impose a visa ban on Malami and his family members. He further lambasted Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and the Army for their contradictory statements since the incident. The advocate, however, hailed the Cable Network News for its investigative report. “CNN has done a fantastic job, they revealed details of bullets used at Lekki. The Nigerian government should prove CNN wrong if they have contrary details and stop the threats”, Abiodun added.

Former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Atiku Abubakar, has described his party as the best friend Nigeria could have. Atiku made the remark while insisting that all geopolitical zones in the country are adequately represented in PDP. The former Vice President stated this in a post on his Facebook page. He also assured Nigerians that the former ruling party has a lot to offer the country. Against this backdrop, Atiku urged Nigerians to keep faith with PDP. He wrote: “The Peoples Democratic Party is the best friend Nigeria could have. “All geopolitical zones deserve a political party that believes in Nigeria and not a party that believes otherwise. “The PDP has much to offer all parts of Nigeria, and I urge all Nigerians in all zones to keep faith with a party that has kept faith with Nigeria and will be equitable to all.” Atiku’s remark comes at a time Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi defected from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Umahi had hinged his defection to APC on PDP’s marginalization of the Southeast.

Chelsea play host to Rennes in the UEFA Champions League on Wednesday aiming to continue their positive run like we’ve seen in recent games. The Londoners have recorded 4 points following the draw and win against Sevilla and Krasnodar respectively. Lampard has a number of changes to make ahead of this game with a couple of fixture line-up in the days ahead. Here, DAILY POST takes a look at how Chelsea could line-up against Rennes in the UEFA Champions League tie. Absent; Billy Gilmour (knee), Christian Pulisic (hamstring) Possible; Kepa Arrizabalaga (shoulder). Chelsea boss Frank Lampard will tend to make few alternations when his side are on a winning run, but he would have acknowledged that rotation of his team list is key this season. Veteran defender Thiago Silva is expected to be absent against Rennes while he’s preserved for the match against the Blades. Kai Havertz and Timo Werner could be listed among the substitutes for Chelsea. And it should see Callum Hudson-Odoi, Tammy Abraham and defender Antonio Rudiger return to the starting line-up in their respective positions. Ben Chilwell could be rested having taken on a work load since his return from the treatment room. And it means Emerson Palmieri could be given a rare start for Chelsea at left back. Jorginho is expected to join N’Golo Kante in a midfield two, despite Lampard’s preference for the latter in the midfield. Christian Pulisic will not be available as he coped with what seems to be a recurring hamstring injury against Burnley. Young Scottish midfielder Billy Gilmour is a couple of weeks away from returning to the Chelsea fold, although he’s making progress in his recovery following a knee injury.

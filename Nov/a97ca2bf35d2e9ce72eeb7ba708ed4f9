United States President Donald Trump has reacted to the victory of Joe Biden in the 2020 Presidential Election. Trump in a statement, accused Democratic candidate Biden of claiming victory. Trump insisted that the election is far from over, adding that Biden has not been certified as the winner in any of the highly contested states headed for mandatory recounts. The American leader said in Pennsylvania, his campaign’s legal observers were not permitted meaningful access to watch the counting process. The Republican stressed that legal votes decide who is president, not the news media. He announced that from Monday, his campaign will start prosecuting cases in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated. Trump noted that Americans are entitled to an honest election to ensure public confidence. “It remains shocking that the Biden campaign refuses to agree with this basic principle and wants ballots counted even if they are fraudulent, manufactured, or cast by ineligible or deceased voters.” Trump added that only a party engaged in wrongdoing would unlawfully keep observers out of the count room – and then fight in court to block their access. “So what is Biden hiding? I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands”, the statement added.

Former President of the Senate, David Mark, has described the death of elder statesman, Alhaji Balarabe Musa, as a big blow to the struggle for the emancipation of the oppressed in Nigeria. Mark, in a statement signed by his Media aide, Paul Mumeh, said that Balarabe was an uncommon activist and defender of the ordinary man. Mark said that Balarabe left at the stage when his wealth of experience and knowledge was needed to navigate through the murky terrain of the Nigerian politics. “Balarabe Musa while alive was a voice for the voiceless. “He was bluntly frank, courageous and steadfast. The late politician never shied away from fighting for justice. He also called a spade its proper name,” part of the statement read. The former Senate president said Nigeria had lost an honest and patriotic statesman. According to him, Balarabe Musa, until his death, remained one of the best and fertile minds amongst the political class. He added that history would be kind to the deceased as he left fond memories and positive footprints in the sand of time. Mark, thereby extended his condolences to the immediate family, government and people of Kaduna State.

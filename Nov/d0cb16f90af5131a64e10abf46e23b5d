Argentina football legend, Diego Maradona, on Tuesday underwent successful surgery for a subdural hematoma in his brain, a day after he was admitted to a hospital. Leopoldo Luque, who is Maradona’s neurosurgeon and personal physician, has now given an update to reporters outside the Olivos clinic in Buenos Aires province. “I was able to evacuate the hematoma successfully and Diego tolerated the surgery very well. “Diego is under control. He has a small drain [to remove fluid] that we are planning to take out tomorrow. His stay at the hospital will depend on his evolution. But the start of his recovery was great. The way he reacted after the surgery is promising,” Luque said. According to the doctor, the procedure took around 80 minutes. Maradona is currently the head coach of first-division side Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata, but has sat out training as a precaution, to avoid the risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 as he is considered in the risk group.

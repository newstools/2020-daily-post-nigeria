Lola Omotayo, wife to one of the defunct Psquare, Peter Okoye has advised that they settle their irreconcilable differences and make peace with each other. Lola made the call in a post via her Instagram account on Thursday while celebrating her husband and his twin brother on their birthday. She reminded them of their relationship, stating that whether they like it or not, they will forever remain twins. “To the twins, Peter and Paul, whether you like it or not, you are brothers. “You two are not just brothers, you are twins and I wish you both a very happy birthday! “ Life is short, make the best of it! Respect and Love should be sacrosanct. “As we get older, we should realize that life is precious and time waits for no one. “More blessings upon both your lives in Jesus Name,” she said.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Friday, said elections in Nigeria will never be credible until there are improvements in the country’s electoral laws. The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Kola Ologbondiyan, stated this at a news conference in Abuja on Friday. Ologbondiyan also said that the party resolved to constitute a broad-based committee to work with the National Assembly and other stakeholders on the Electoral Act amendment to make Nigeria’s elections free, fair and credible. “For us in the PDP, we believe that until there are improvements in our electoral laws, our elections are not going to be credible and this is going to endanger our democracy. “So, the PDP has resolved to constitute a committee that will work in tandem with NASS members elected on the platform of our party and other interested parties as well to form a broad-based committee that will work with our legislators. “We are also going to engage the civil societies on electoral reforms. “As a party we have seen that the issue of electoral frauds, abuses, hijack of electoral process can only be redeemed if every Nigerian agrees in unison that we must amend the rules. “This is why the PDP has agreed to work in concert with CSOs, faith-based organisations, community leaders to entrench a law in the system in which the people can truly elect their representatives,” he said.

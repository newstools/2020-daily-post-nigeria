United States President, Donald Trump has now expressed uncertainty over his White House chances. Trump spoke publicly for the first time since the November 3 presidential election was won by Joe Biden. The Incumbent President addressed the press at the White House on the US Coronavirus response on Friday. Before now, the President had insisted that he won the Presidency, assuring his supporters that the court will declare him winner. However, speaking briefly on the election result, Trump said, “Whatever happens in the future – who knows which administration it will be, I guess time will tell.” The President insisted that he would not declare another COVID-19 lockdown “under any circumstances”. Trump has refused to concede the election to Joe Biden, candidate of the Democratic Party.

The presidential candidate of the Democratic Party, Joe Biden, has vowed to reverse President Donald Trump’s decision for the United States to leave the Paris Accord. The US became the first country to ever withdraw from an international climate change pact. Trump had announced the pull-out in June 2017, but in line with United Nations (UN) regulations, the exit took effect November 4. With election results pointing to a likely defeat for Trump, Biden took on the tone of a president-elect and made clear that climate was a top priority. “Today, the Trump Administration officially left the Paris Climate Agreement. And in exactly 77 days, a Biden Administration will rejoin it,” Biden, who would take the presidential oath on January 20, tweeted. Biden has proposed a $1.7trillion plan to take the US, the world’s second biggest carbon emitter, to net zero by 2050.

Gunmen have shot a 38-year-old vigilante, Omile Chukwudi dead. The incident occurred at about 12:30am on Tuesday of November 3 at Sapele Local Government Area of Delta State. It was learnt that the gunmen fired the deceased who was on patrol at the urban area of the town at closed range. He later died because he could not get help from anyone in the tensed area. The Delta State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, is yet to lift its ban on members covering Police activities in the State. The Union threatened to suspend any member who flouts its order. It would be recalled that some Policemen in Ovwian/Aladja Divisional Headquarters recently in the heat of the END SARS protests attacked a Vanguard Correspondent, Mr. Akpokona Omafuaire Esq. The policemen also macheted the journalist and vandalized his car. Based on this, Our Correspondent actually called the Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya for confirmation of the report and she spoke briefly.

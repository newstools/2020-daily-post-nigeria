The apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has expressed concern on the continued molestation of residents of Obigbo in Rivers State. Ohanaeze warned soldiers still molesting armless people of Obigbo in Rivers State to stop forthwith, calling on the Rivers state Governor Nyesom Wike to call the soldiers to order. The Igbo socio-cultural group, in a release by its Spokesman, Chuks Ibegbu and forwarded to DAILY POST on Wednesday, further warned the army that Obigbo is not an occupied territory or conquered people. Ohanaeze noted that several weeks after the invasion of the area, soldiers of the Nigeria army are still in the area molesting and dehumanising residents. It cautioned people making inciting comments on the matter to hold their peace even as he insisted that any soldier responsible for the death of innocent persons in Obigbo should be fished out and punished. The Igbo group stressed that the lives of all Nigerians including soldiers and policemen matter and nobody has the right to deprive anybody his life savings on any such sentence by a court of competent jurisdiction. Ohanaeze Ndigbo, however, called for the trial of all SARS men involved in extrajudicial killings.

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has demanded more consistency from Nicolas Pepe following their 4-1 win over Molde in the Europa League. Arteta’s men went behind in the 22nd minute, before two own goals put them in front. Pepe made it 3-1 and then set up Joe Willock for the last goal. The Ivorian winger now has three goals from 11 appearances this season. When asked what Pepe needs to do to start for Arsenal in the Premier League again, Arteta replied: “Consistency throughout the game, throughout 90 minutes in every ball, in every action and every time he is on the ball in the final third to make a difference and do it more and more and more. “The final product has to be better, not just from him, if we want to become a top, top team and score many more goals it’s something we have to put higher demands on at the moment. “Today he scored a really good goal, another assist and he can do more. But I think he is on the right path.”

The National Broadcasting Commission (NBC) has failed to explain reasons why the federal government concluded that viral videos of the End SARS protest were fake. Acting NBC Director-General, Armstrong Idachaba, could not make any explanations when he was questioned on Arise TV on Wednesday. The interviewer had queried him on tools used for the verification but the NBC boss had no clue. He reminded the NBC boss that reputable international organizations ascertained that the videos were not doctored. Responding, Idachaba, a Professor of Mass Communications, answered evasively. “The onus is on the broadcaster to verify, to authenticate; it’s not on the regulator”, he said. The federal government had sanctioned three broadcast stations on October 26, barely a week after the Lekki shooting. AIT, Arise TV and Channels were accused of broadcasting fake online photos and videos of the protests. Announcing the N3 million fine against each station, Idachaba had claimed the footages aired fuelled violence across Nigeria. Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) is challenging the action in court.

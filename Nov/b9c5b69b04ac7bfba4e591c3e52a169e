Former England and Arsenal striker, Ian Wright, believes Chelsea and Tottenham will share points when both London clubs clash on Sunday. Frank Lampard’s in-form Blues host Spurs, in search of a fourth league victory in a row. But Jose Mourinho’s men are also on an impressive run of their own, with four consecutive league wins including a 2-0 victory over Manchester City in their last outing. A point would be enough for Tottenham to go atop, while a win for Chelsea would mean they leapfrog both their bitter rivals and Liverpool to claim first place. “I’m going to go with a draw, probably 2-2 or something. I fancy a draw in that game,” Wright told Optus Sport.

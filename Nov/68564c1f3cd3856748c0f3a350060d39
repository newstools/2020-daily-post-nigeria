Arsenal players have been forced to spend one extra night in Norway, after their flight back was cancelled, following their Europa League group game with Molde, SportsMail reports. Mikel Arteta and his squad were due to return to London immediately after the game. However, they have had to change their places, because of foggy weather conditions in the UK. The decision was taken not to fly back, in order to avoid potentially having to change which airport they landed at – possibly one outside of London, which would have extended their return journeys home. Arsenal instead headed back to their hotel and will now fly back on Friday morning. The squad will train in the afternoon ahead of Sunday’s Premier League game against Wolves.

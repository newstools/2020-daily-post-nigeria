Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said his team has “no excuses” for losing 4-1 to Valencia on Sunday. Carlos Soler converted a hat-trick of penalties, as the reigning LaLiga champions suffered another setback. Madrid took the lead through Karim Benzema, but presented their hosts with four gifts, including three spot-kicks and an own-goal scored by Raphael Varane. This is the first time Madrid have conceded four goals since letting in five against Barcelona in October 2018. “There is no justification, no excuses. It’s a bad game and a bad day. “Everything happened to us,” Zidane told his post-match conference.

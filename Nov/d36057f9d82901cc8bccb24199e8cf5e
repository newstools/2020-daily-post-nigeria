The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) says the All Progressives Congress (APC) Governors visited former President, Goodluck Jonathan because they have realised that Nigeria was better under the PDP. The party said the development was an endorsement of PDP administration and that it indicated that the APC, in 2015, created artificial symbols of misgovernance, corruption and other misgivings just to grab power. Kola Ologbondiyan, National Publicity Secretary, lambasted the APC in a statement on Sunday. He said the Jonathan administration succeeded in office due to PDP’s understanding of the nuances of Nigeria, which it translated into people-oriented policies and programmes to make life comfortable for citizens. The spokesman noted that APC governors have accepted PDP successes in building a strong nation with a virile economy that was rated as one of the fastest growing economies of the world. “The visit is therefore a subtle step by APC governors into the corridors of the PDP in agreement that our party holds the solution to the myriads of problems brought to our nation by their APC and President Muhammadu Buhari. “The PDP, therefore, receives the visit by the APC governors as an apology by the APC to our party and Nigerians over the lies, beguilements and other irresponsible allegations deployed by the APC to grab power, only to lead our nation on a journey to nowhere.” The opposition cautioned Nigerians to be watchful of the antics of the APC that have failed in governance and the management of its own affairs. Ologbondiyan added that for PDP, the unity, stability, progress and development of Nigeria remain paramount. The statement assured that PDP will not allow “the failed APC and its pranksters, who have betrayed the trust of Nigerians, to mislead them once again”.

The ground troops of the Operation Thunder Strike (OPTS) on Friday night foiled an attempted kidnap by armed bandits of citizens plying the Kaduna-Abuja road. The Commissioner, Ministry of Internal Security and Home Affairs, Mr. Samuel Aruwan, in a statement said
“The Kaduna State Government received operational feedback that the armed bandits attempted to operate at the Kasarami axis of the road situated in Chikun local government area at around 7:38pm. “The troops on aggressive patrols engaged the armed bandits who dispersed in disarray while the troops pursued them off the road. “Many of the bandits seem to escape with bullet wounds. Troops are still trailing them and citizens will be briefed on the development.” According to the statement, “the rest of the troops manned the road to ensure dissolution of the traffic that built up following their engagement. “The Kaduna State Government apologizes to motorists and other road users who suffered delays as a result of the security response. The inconveniences were an unintended consequence of efforts to protect lives and property. “As at the time of this security update, traffic is flowing on both lanes of the highway, and the troops are sustaining aggressive fighting patrols to deny the criminals freedom of action,” the statement added.

President Muhammadu Buhari on Saturday sent good wishes to former Military Governor of Plateau State, retired Rear Admiral Samuel Bitrus Atukum. In a statement on the occasion of Atukum’s 80th birthday anniversary, Buhari reminded the celebrant to offer his counsel to the administration when the need arises. Buhari described him as “one of the most dedicated military officers that had served under him as Head of State.” The Nigerian leader noted that his old ally belonged to a crop of officers whose zeal for duty and patriotism was impressive and worthy of emulation. The President said he was impressed that Atukum put professionalism and patriotism above other interests in the service of Nigeria. “As you savour the joy of this occasion, I pray to God to bless you with better health and longer life. I am proud of you and your service to Nigeria. “I appeal to you not to hesitate to offer us your invaluable advice whenever necessary,” Buhari told the elder statesman.

The Inspector General of Police, Muhammed Adamu, has revealed that police officers who lost their lives and those injured following the violence that erupted during the End SARS protest will be promoted to the next rank. Adamu said this after assessing burnt police stations in Edo state on Wednesday. According to him, police officers across the country will continue to enjoy health insurance even after retirement. The IGP also said that families of those who lost their lives and those injured will be compensated. “While in service, we registered for Health Insurance Scheme but it stops when we retired. “However, this government said it is not encouraging and it is now part of the law that those that have retired from the force will continue to enjoy health insurance scheme,” he said.

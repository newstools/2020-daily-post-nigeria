President Muhammadu Buhari has mourned the passing of former civilian governor of Kaduna State, Alhaji Balarabe Musa. Buhari in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media & Publicity, Garba Shehu said Musa will be sorely missed by all Nigerians who have diligently followed his antecedents as a voice for the voiceless. Buhari said the Second Republic governor reflected the passion and vigour that heralded Nigeria’s independence, which steadily translated into activism for return to democracy. He said Musa left a bold footprint on Nigeria’s democracy and will be remembered for his role in promoting good governance. The President further asked God to grant the deceased eternal rest and comfort his family, friends and associates.

Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, has accused the All Progressives Congress, APC, of conspiring to remove former President, Goodluck Jonathan. Wike disclosed this while hosting some members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, who defected to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, at the party’s Secretariat yesterday. The governor said despite orchestrating Jonathan’s removal from power, APC has continued to give excuses for its failures. “Are things better today? So, why do you allow people to tell you lies? How long can you continue to listen to the lies of the APC? “They have nothing for Nigerians. It is unfortunate that there was a conspiracy to remove a Niger Delta person as President,” Wike said.

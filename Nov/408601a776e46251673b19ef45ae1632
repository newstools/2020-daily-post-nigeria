The United Kingdom has reacted to the submission of CCTV footage by the Lekki Concession Company (LCC) on Wednesday. The company appeared before Judicial Panel of Inquiry set up by the Lagos State Government. The panel is probing human rights abuses perpetrated by members of the disbanded Police Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and the Lekki shooting. LCC MD, Abayomi Omomuwa, said the surveillance camera at the toll plaza stopped working at 8pm on Tuesday, October 20. It was the night soldiers marched to the Lekki End SARS rally ground and opened fire on unarmed protesters from about 6:45pm. Omomuwa’s disclosure has sparked further outrage, with many wondering why the camera stopped functioning. On Thursday, Catriona Laing, British High Commissioner to Nigeria, spoke on the development. The envoy urged the panel to study incidents captured in the available recording. “Important the @LagosSarsPanel accesses CCTV footage to help explain what happened on 20/10 at #Lekki. “I welcome the appearance of @LCCTollRoad at the panel in Lagos, and ongoing work to ensure accountability for crimes committed. @UKinNigeria @followlasg”, Laing tweeted.

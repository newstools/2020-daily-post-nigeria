Nnamdi Kanu of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has lambasted the United States, United Kingdom Ambassadors to Nigeria and the International Criminal Court (ICC), over their silence in the recent massacres in Obigbo, Rivers and Borno States. Kanu lamented that these nations and the international organisations have maintained grave silence in the face of extrajudicial killings around the country. In a statement through Kanu, Media and Publicity Secretary of IPOB, Emma Powerful, Kanu said nobody appears to care about those being killed. “It is now clear the international community no longer care about victims of state orchestrated mass murder like what obtained in the North and Obigbo in Rivers State,” Kanu, who is currently hiding in the UK, lamented. “Appealing to the moral sense of responsibility of conscientious civilised nations no longer work, perhaps they want survivors of these brutal massacres all over Nigeria to go into armed resistance.” According to the IPOB leader, “the Nigerian Army only have power over unarmed citizens,” while the much ‘respected’ Fulani terror franchise like Boko Haram, ISWAP and bandits are busy chopping off the heads of rice farmers in Borno. Kanu wondered why the Nigerian Army is obstructing independent investigations, “If all the outlandish concoctions and outright lies against IPOB used to justify Oyigbo massacre were true.”

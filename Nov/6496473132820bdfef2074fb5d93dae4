A presidential candidate in the last general elections, Kingsley Moghalu, has warned the President Muhammadu Buhari government against the clampdown on some promoters of the recently End SARS protests. The former Young Progressive Party (YPP) flagbearer noted that the move will backfire, describing it as unacceptable. Moghalu, a former Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN Deputy Governor tweeted on Monday that such action is entirely wrong, adding that it would lead to more crisis. “The clampdown on #EndSARS protesters and supporters is completely WRONG and unacceptable!,” he tweeted. “I urge the authorities to ‘reverse gear’. These actions raise questions about the good faith of the government and risk igniting even more resistance. Not wise!” The Buhari government had last obtained court injunction from the federal High Court in Abuja to freeze the bank accounts of 19 individuals and a public affairs company link to the protests. The court granted CBN’s request to freeze the accounts.

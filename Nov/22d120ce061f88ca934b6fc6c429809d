The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, on Thursday, dismissed reports that he has made all necessary arrangements to decamp from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to rejoin the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ortom, in a statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Terver Akase, also said that he was contacted by some notable persons to defect from PDP, but he declined the invitation. He said, “We have read some mischievous statements by members of the opposition in Benue State insinuating that Governor Samuel Ortom plans to rejoin All Progressives Congress, APC. “Those involved in the impish allegation are clearly doing so to soothe their stuck-up apprehensions. “Why will Governor Ortom return to APC? To do what? “It is true that the Governor was contacted by some notable persons to defect from Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, but he declined the invitation. “Governor Ortom is the leader of PDP in North Central Nigeria, and he is enjoying a robust relationship with other leaders of the party in Benue State and the entire region. It is therefore ridiculous for anyone to insinuate that the Governor has the intention to leave PDP.”

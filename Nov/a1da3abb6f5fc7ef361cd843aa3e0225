Super Eagles defender, William Troost-Ekong, has said that Gernot Rohr’s men will beat Sierra Leone in Tuesday’s second leg Group L match-day four 2022 AFCON qualifier tie if they can replicate their first half performance which saw them race to a 4-0 lead in the first leg reverse fixture. Sierra Leone made a shock comeback by cancelling a 4-0 deficit to draw 4-4 against the Super Eagles in the reverse fixture in Benin City, Edo State last Friday. Speaking after the Super Eagles’ training session on Monday, Troost-Ekong said at his pre-match press conference that Rohr’s side must make sure they concentrate throughout the duration of the match, adding that they are ready to tackle Sierra Leone in Freetown. “We are ready, we just finished a good practice session, and everyone’s ready for the game tomorrow,” the Watford star said. “We prepare like any other game with this team (Sierra Leone) we don’t under-estimate anyone, and if we can just bring what we did in the first half of the last game and make sure we keep concentrated and see out the game, I think we have a good chance to do what we need to do. “They (Nigerian fans) will see a team that is very hungry to get the win here. We want to qualify as soon as possible, and it is up to us to do it tomorrow.” The match kick-off time is 5 pm.

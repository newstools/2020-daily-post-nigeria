The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has berated the Presidency over remarks by President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide, Garba Shehu on Boko Haram killing of rice farmers in Borno State. PDP accused the Presidency of trying to rationalize the gruesome killing of 43 innocent Nigerians by the insurgents in their farms. The party lamented that the Buhari-led Presidency was trying to turn itself into a mouthpiece for terrorists. Recall that Shehu had said those killed by Boko Haram in Zabarmari failed to get military clearance before going to the farm. Reacting, PDP’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan said: “The PDP is outraged by the claims that the farmers were killed because they failed to get clearance before going to their farms, a statement, which is also an admission that the Buhari administration has been overwhelmed by terrorists and can no longer guarantee our compatriots a normal life. “Our party submits that it is weird, reprehensible and repulsive that the Buhari Presidency now seeks to turn itself into a mouthpiece of terrorists by this subtle attempt to rationalize the killing of innocent and hardworking Nigerians. “This unpatriotic stance smacks of support for acts of terrorism and the mindless killing of our compatriots by a government whose Commander-in-Chief had promised Nigerians to lead the battle against insurgents from the front. “Our party is forced to hold that attitudes such as the unpatriotic remark of the Buhari Presidency embolden insurgents in their ceaseless attacks in our country.”

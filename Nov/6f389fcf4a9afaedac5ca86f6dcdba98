President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and his Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolas Maduro, have made demands from the US Government as the world awaits the next American President. Rouhani wants the next US administration to restart fulfilling commitments under the Iran nuclear deal. The President, in a televised speech on Saturday, said the Iranian people have faced “economic terrorism” for the past three years and have shown admirable resistance, according to Al Jazeera. Rouhani said he is being hopeful that those who sanctioned Iran will come to the conclusion their methods have been wrong and will bear no results. Also, Venezuela’s President expressed “concern” about the uncertainty of the presidential election results in the US. The election entered its fifth day on Saturday as counting of ballots continues in some major states. President Trump, in recent years has pursued a campaign of aggressive sanctions against Venezuela’s ruling Socialist Party. Some of the sanctions against the ruling government have included asset freezes and travel bans for senior officials. However, Maduro said he wishes to have better bilateral relations with the US “no matter who wins the presidential elections”.

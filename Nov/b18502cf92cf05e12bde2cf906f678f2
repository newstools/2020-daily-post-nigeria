Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted his side were ‘lucky’ with the West Brom penalty decision that was overturned during their 1-0 win at Old Trafford on Saturday. After a goalless first half, Slaven Bilic’s side were awarded a penalty in the second half after referee David Coote deemed Bruno Fernandes had fouled Conor Gallagher in the box. Coote eventually reviewed the incident on the VAR pitch-side monitor and reversed his decision. The referee later awarded United a penalty 10 minutes later, which Fernandes tucked away. But after his first attempt was saved, goalkeeper Sam Johnstone was caught coming off his line. Solskjaer, speaking to BT Sport after the game, admits his side were lucky West Brom’s penalty was chalked off, noting that he believed a similar call in an earlier Premier League game was wrong. “I looked at a penalty this afternoon, Villa-Brighton and there’s contact on the ball and then the man. “In my head, it might be a penalty. Maybe, here we’re a tad lucky but none of them are given. Maybe the rules are different to how I interpret them,” he said.

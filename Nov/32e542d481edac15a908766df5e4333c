The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has revealed what God told him concerning Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu and forthcoming 2023 elections. Ayodele, in a statement to DAILY POST on Friday, noted that if Sanwo-Olu is allowed to have a second term, the economy of Lagos state will witness a massive progress, and the people will enjoy a breathe of fresh air because the Lord is with him. He said Sanwo-Olu will become one of the best governors in Nigeria, making it known that his first term has been affected by the poisonous stings of COVID-19, and hoodlums attack but his second term will restore hope to Lagosians “The Lord said to me that the governor of Lagos state, Mr Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu should be allowed to have a second term by the leadership of the APC. The Lord wants to do a new thing in Lagos, and Governor Sanwo-Olu will be the one to be used. “In terms of security, infrastructure, employment, wealth creation, Sanwo-Olu will do better and the economy of Lagos will be blooming. “Hoodlums attack and Covid-19 has done damage to his first term, but his second term will be far better than his first term. “He has suffered so much to fail, He is the only one that has been ordained by God to take Lagos to the next level. “He is not my friend, and we don’t have a personal relationship but I am saying what the Lord has told me, Governor Sanwo-Olu second term will be one of the best Lagos has ever enjoyed. “The hand of the Lord is upon him, and He has set him on a mission which needs to be fulfilled in his second term.’’

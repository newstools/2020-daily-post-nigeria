The Zamfara State Police Command has assured that 2,300 armed policemen would be deployed to Bakura for the constituency’s bye-election into the state House of Assembly coming up on the 5th of December 2020. Addressing newsmen at the state police command in Gusau, the state capital, the Commissioner of Police, Barrister Usman Nagogo said the security agencies in the state have mapped out strategies for a hitch-free bye-election. “We know that some areas in Bakura Local Government Area of the state have been noted for banditry for years. We will therefore take action against any bandit that would want to disrupt the election” he lamented. “These bandits can use the opportunity of the bye-election to scare people in order for them to perform their dastard activities. But we must engage them on fire for fire operation” Barrister Nagogo stressed that there are 104 wards in Bakura constituency and all the wards would be adequately secured, pointing out that any politician found sponsoring thugs or bandits would be seriously dealt with irrespective of position or status. The commissioner, however, warned the politicians to play by the rule, stressing that nobody is above the law of the land or untouchable in the system. According to him, the heads of security agencies in the state will hold closed-door meetings with the leaders of the whole registered political parties at Bakura town, where they would sign a peace accord regarding the bye-election. He said that the security agencies have no business with politics and would not meddle with politics as the constitutional responsibility of the security agencies is to secure the lives and properties of the people in the state. The state police boss said that there will be total restriction of movement on the day of the election and that no room would be given for any rigging as there would be adequate and coordinated security network in the constituency.

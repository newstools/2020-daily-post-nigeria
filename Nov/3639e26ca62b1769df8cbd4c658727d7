Governor Umar Ganduje’s Special Adviser on Media, Salihu Tanko Yakasai has blamed Arewa community for the level of insecurity in the North. The North region, in recent days, have been ravaged with kidnappings and killings. Few hours ago, about 43 farmers were beheaded by Boko Haram terrorists in Zabarmari, Borno State. Dawisu condemning the incident, lamented the non-cooperation of some Northerners, who he said failed to speak up against killings and kidnappings in the north. On his Twitter page, he wrote: “Inna Lillahi Wa Inna Ilaihirrajiun! 43 innocent souls lost for no reason, 43 families thrown into more darkness, 43 less farmers that will feed the nation, 43 new victims that have died in vain. 43 blood in the hands of those that are supposed to protect them. “I blame arewa for tolerating this level of insecurity. By the time each and every household, in each and every state is engulfed in it, perhaps then we will wake up and defend ourselves against this barbaric attacks & kidnappings. Clearly, no end in sight. #ZabarmariMassacre “To even speak with one voice on the insecurity in the North is a challenge. We are not ready yet. #SecureNorth.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-856836" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5277.jpg" alt="" width="1656" height="1654" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5277.jpg 1656w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5277-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5277-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5277-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5277-1536x1534.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_5277-80x80.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 1656px) 100vw, 1656px">

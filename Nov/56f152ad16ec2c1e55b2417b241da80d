Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said Paul Pogba will not face Southampton in the Premier League this weekend. Pogba played three times during the international break but has not featured for Solskjaer in the two games since after aggravating a knock picked up while playing for France. Marcus Rashford, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Victor Lindelof remain doubtful. Other players like Luke Shaw and Jesse Lingard have no chance of playing in the game. “Scott (McTominay) and Paul (Pogba) didn’t train this morning, weren’t on the grass so looks very unlikely for the weekend,” Solskjaer said in his pre-match press conference today. “Marcus (Rashford), Victor (Lindelof), Aaron (Wan-Bissaka) came through the session today so not 100%. “Luke (Shaw) has just started his rehab out on the grass but is not back with the team yet. Jesse (Lingard) is back from his isolation period and has had a couple of days training and Phil Jones is out until after Christmas sometime.”

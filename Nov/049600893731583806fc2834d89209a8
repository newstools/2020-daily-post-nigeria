The teacher said they will not fail to embark on strike if the Acting Education Secretary failed to reverse the deployment and demotion of the head teacher. This was contained in a petition signed by Oriere Duba, NUT chairman of the local government, secretary, Eyonse Martins, and two others and addressed to the state executive of the union and the state chairman of Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Benin City. According to the petition, “if this decision is not reversed in the next seven days, we shall have no choice than to shut down education activities in the local government area.”

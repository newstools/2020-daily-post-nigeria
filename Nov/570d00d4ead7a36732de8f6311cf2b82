Nollywood actress, Linda Osifo, has revealed she nearly had surgery to remove her facial tribal marks. Osifo on her Instagram page said she was bullied as a child because of her tribal marks and this made her consider undergoing surgery to remove them. According to her, “while in elementary school in Canada, I remember being made fun of about my tribal marks and asked if I got scratched by lions in Africa. The teasing got so bad that I tried surgically to remove my tribal marks.” However, though she felt it made her ugly at the time, the actress says she has now come to realise how unique her marks make her. “I felt the tribal marks made me so ugly and weird from everyone else around me because I did not understand why I had it in the first place! “Now that I’m all grown and wise, I’ve come to realize how beautiful and unique it sure makes me look. True beauty does not come from physical attributes, it comes from what is within. Here’s to the tribal mark gang,” her post added.

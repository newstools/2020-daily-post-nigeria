Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has warned President Donald Trump against tampering with the oldest democracy in the world. He noted that the whole world is watching what is happening in America at the moment with close interest because the outcome will not affect the Americans alone. In a chat with DAILY POST on Saturday, the senior lawyer said it was becoming clearer by the day, that Democrat candidate, Joe Biden is most likely going to be the winner of the election. The incumbent President has been crying foul, alleging shenanigans and electoral fraud and filed several suit in court. However, Bamgbose said even if he had supported Trump’s reelection, the will of the majority must be respected. “Much as he has every right to do what he has done or doing, one will urge him, not to tamper with the 232 years of democracy in America,” Bamgbose, a 2023 presidential hopeful, said. “He must respect the values of democracy and bow to the will of the Americans. His defiance to accept defeat might destabilize democracy in America. “This will definitely be a bad omen and an ugly precedent. Unfortunately, there is nothing so persuasive in American Constitution to force out an incumbent President who refuses to step down after electoral defeat. “However Donald Trump should honorably step down as a mark of respect for the will of the majority if defeated by Joe Biden. “American democracy is no doubt under threat, should he blatantly refuse to concede to defeat. Democracy has come to stand. It remains the best form of government available to mankind,” he said.

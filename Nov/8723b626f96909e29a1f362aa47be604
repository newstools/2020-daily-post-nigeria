A worship centre attended by Elder Wike, father of the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike was attacked by some unknown hoodlums who detonated dynamite that caused damage to the Church Saturday night. This is the second time the Church, Christain Universal Church International at #25, Azikiwe Street Mile 3-Diobu, Port Harcourt will be attacked under one month. The Church was first attacked by a set of hoodlums during the heat of the violent EndSARS protest in Rivers State where they pelted stones at the Church building. This time, two suspects who allegedly detonated the dynamite at the worship centre, attended by Governor Wike’s Father, were arrested. The suspects were alleged to have stormed the Church where they detonated the first dynamite which attracted the attention of some youths in the area. The youths swooped on them before they could donate the second one. A resident of the area, Collins Johnbull who is also the Assistant Chief Security Officer of Azikwe street, told newsmen that they saw five men entering the church at about 9 pm Saturday but did not know their mission until they heard the sound of dynamite which forced those residing inside the church to run for safety. Johnbull said, “we quickly mobilised other people in the area and gave the hoodlums a chase. We were able to catch two of them while the other members of the gang escaped. Those arrested have been handed over to the police.” DAILY POST reports that the exploded dynamite caused little damage to the Church, leaving some glass windows shattered and cracks on a part of the church. The Rivers State Police Command is yet to react to the development but officers and men of the Eagle Crack Unit, MOPOL 19 and plain cloth police officers have been deployed to the scene of the incident.

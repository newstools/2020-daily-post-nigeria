The Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammad Dingyadi, has said the Federal Government is committed to ensuring there is no repeat of the violence that broke out in parts of the country in the wake of the recent End SARS protest. Dingyadi disclosed this to State House correspondents after a meeting of the National Security Council presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He quoted Buhari as saying that relevant stakeholders including the youth, will be carried along to forestall a repeat. When asked whether it would include a crackdown on potential protesters, Dingyadi replied, “On the issue of End SARS that you have raised, what we are saying is that the government will continue to dialogue. “It will continue to listen and will continue to carry all stakeholders along in ensuring that there is no repeat of what happened that destroyed a lot of properties, public and private, individuals in this country.” He also said the council expressed concerns over the continuous insecurity in the northern part of the country and agreed it must be dealt with more decisively, employing proactive methods.

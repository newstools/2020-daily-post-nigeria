A Magistrates’ Court in Makurdi, on Tuesday, ordered that two brothers who allegedly defiled a 10-year-old girl be remanded in a correctional facility. The prosecutor, Sgt. Ato Godwin told the court that the case was reported at the Divisional police station Orokam by the complainant, Margret Okoh of Ipole Igwu Orokam, Benue, on Oct. 11, 2020. He alleged that the brothers defiled the victim in her grandmother’s house. Godwin prayed the court for an adjournment to enable the police complete investigation into the matter. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of sections 97 and 284 of the Penal Code Law of Benue 2004. However, Magistrate Ajuma Igama, who did not take the plea of the brothers for want of jurisdiction, ordered the police to duplicate the case file and return same to the Benue Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for legal advice. Igama adjourned the matter until Nov. 19, for DPP legal advice, NAN reports.

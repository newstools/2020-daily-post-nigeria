Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has insisted his former mentor Jose Mourinho remains a top coach ahead of the table with Tottenham on Sunday. Mourinho has faced increasing scrutiny over his tactics and his style of man management, but his Spurs team have answered the critics in recent weeks. Lampard believes Mourinho remains a top manager, even after a difficult end of his second spell with Chelsea and problems during his stint at Manchester United. “Of course he is [still a top manager]. You don’t have a record as decorated as Jose Mourinho has a manager without being a very talented coach. “For all of us, the game is so reactionary at the moment and particularly in the modern era with social media reactions form will always be judged very harshly for any manager. Tottenham are in good form. They are on a good run; they have good players, they have a good manager. “It will be a very difficult game for us. I played in the fixture many times, and the fact we’re in good form towards the top of the table adds spice, we’re in positions we want to be in and we’re all fighting for those. “So it’s a game that remains special for those reasons, and the league positions, of course, all eyes will be drawn to it,” Lampard said in his pre-match press conference.

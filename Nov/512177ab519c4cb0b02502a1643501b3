Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has blamed his side’s poor start for their 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday. The Red Devils are yet to win at Old Trafford this season after four Premier League fixtures. Solskjaer watched as his team was dominated by Arsenal, with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s penalty deciding the match. Speaking after the game, Solskjaer who started with a diamond formation in midfield, balemd his side’s sloppiness. He said: “We never turned up on the first half, no tempo, no shape. They were better than us. Second half it didn’t look like they were gonna score. “There’s many reasons for the poor first half, maybe how well we did on Wednesday was one of them, when you win you take your foot off the pedal. But that’s not what you can do. “The system depends on the team you play against. We were too sloppy today, too many passes went astray. “There is a reason behind big squads in football. With the highs of the PSG game then a little drop, then good against Leipzig and then a drop today.”

Nigerian music legend, Idris Abdulkareem has described President Muhammadu’s administration as a ‘very mean regime surviving on life support system’. Abdulkareem said this while reacting to dollar exchange rate to the Naira and the state of economy in Nigeria. He further applauded Nigerians, noting that it is a miracle to live in Nigeria at this point. On his Instagram page, he wrote: “When you see a Nigerian living in Nigeria, give him/her some accolades. “It is a miracle to live here. Shocking if you save a Naira a day you may not have up to a dollar at the end of the year. “$1=N475, A very mean mean regime, surviving on propagandas and life support system. Transmogrifying Change to Next level.”<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-855958" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-12.jpg.webp" alt="" width="828" height="1153" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-12.jpg.webp 828w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-12-215x300.jpg.webp 215w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/unnamed-12-735x1024.jpg.webp 735w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px">

Borno Governor, Babagana Zulum has expressed excitement over the conviction of alleged Boko Haram sponsors in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Zulum said he was glad that for the first time in 11 years, there appeared to be a headway on tracking some financiers of the sect. The governor lamented that Boko Haram had killed thousands of citizens, displaced millions, and damaged private and public properties worth billions of Naira. In a statement on Tuesday by his spokesman, Isa Gusau, Zulum urged President Muhammadu Buhari to set up a multi-stakeholder committee to follow up on the UAE findings. He noted that such intelligence if authenticated, be used to expand search on other Boko Haram sponsors within and outside Nigeria. Zulum suggested that team members be drawn from the Ministries of Justice, and Foreign Affairs, National Intelligence Agency, Defence Intelligence Agency, the Multinational Joint Task Force, ECOWAS, among others. Recall that in February 2020, Governor declared two days of statewide fasting and prayers against the dreaded Boko Haram terror group and their sponsors.

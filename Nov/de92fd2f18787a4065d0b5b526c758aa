D’Tigers invitee, Chima Moneke, has disclosed how he felt after being named in the 2021 FIBA Afrobasket 20 man provisional list. Moneke told NBBF media that he cried after the Nigerian Basketball Federation invitation. The Power Forward who plays for Orléans Loiret Basket in France recalled that he could not control his emotions. “I cried when I got the call. I called all of my friends, the people that I love, the people who care about me and they were very proud of me and most importantly my parents. They cried, I cried. “I knew they would get emotional because representing my country is probably more important to them than being in the NBA if I ever get the chance to do that. It was an amazing moment, I wasn’t expecting and it made it sweeter.” On his hopes of breaking into the national team, Moneke assured that with his deep knowledge about the team as a fan; fitting in will not be difficult. “I have plenty of knowledge about the team. I am Nigeria through and through. I was born there and raised. My parents are Nigerians and all my brothers are Nigerians”, the player added.

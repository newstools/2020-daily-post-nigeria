The Ogun State Ministry of Education, Science and Technology has told primary and secondary schools in the state not to resume fully yet. DAILY POST recalls that Governor Dapo Abiodun had ordered the full reopening of schools, hotels, worship centres and other establishments that were shut down as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. But in a statement by the Ogun State Commissioner for Education, Professor Abayomi Arigbabu, the state government clarified the earlier statement on schools’ resumption, stating that, “the existing schedule remains.” For the avoidance of doubt, Arigbabu stated that all government primary and secondary schools will not resume full school hours until further notice. According to him, all public schools will continue to have their classes in phases to avoid overcrowding and to help curtail the spread of Coronavirus. He added that, “an additional hour has been added to the duration of stay in school for SS 3 students,” saying they are to be in school from 12 Pm to 4pm” in preparation for the 2020/2021 WASSCE.”

The Federal Government has reached out to Niger Republic and the United States of America, in a bid to execute the arrest warrant issued by an Abuja court against a former Chairman of Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT), Abdulrasheed Maina, who is believed to have jumped bail. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) revealed this in the counter-affidavit filed against Senator Mohammed Ali Ndume’s bail application filed before a Federal High Court in Abuja. Maina is on trial for money laundering. And the court on November 18, revoked the bail granted to him and issued a bench warrant for his arrest. “The prosecution has obtained the bench warrant and it is making frantic efforts to execute it while enlisting the support of other security agencies in the country as well as some foreign governments, particularly the Republic of Niger and the United States of America,” the EFCC said in the counter-affidavit. EFCC urged the court to reject the bail application by Ndume, arguing that it was a ploy for him to evade consequences of serving as a surety for Maina and avoid meeting the condition set by the court for his release. Earlier this week, the court ordered that Ndume, who stood surety for Maina, be remanded in prison pending when he is either able to produce the defendant or forfeit the N500m bail bond he signed, having failed to account for Maina’s whereabouts.

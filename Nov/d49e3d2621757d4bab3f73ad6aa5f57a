Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyng, has said he is part of the “biggest problem” at the club, which is lack of goals. But the Gabon striker believes the Gunners will soon “surprise the world”. Mikel Arteta’s side have been short on goals in the 2020/21 campaign. Only three teams, who all sit inside the Premier League’s bottom four, have found the target on fewer occasions than Arsenal this season. Arsenal have just nine goals to their name, with Aubameyang netting only two of those. He told AfriqueSports: “The biggest problem the club is facing right now is the lack of goals, but the manager and the rest of the players are trying to overcome this problem. “Even though the results have not been good recently, we still hope that in the near future everything will be fine and we will surprise the world. We have the players that will take us to the level we want to get to.”

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that Christian Pulisic is still struggling with a hamstring injury and will miss their Premier League clash with Sheffield United. However, goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga is available again, after recovering from a shoulder problem. Pulisic pulled up in the warm-up at Burnley last weekend and was replaced by Timo Werner in the starting XI. The American forward also missed Chelsea’s win over Rennes in the Champions League in midweek. “No, he’s not fit to play,” Lampard said at his pre-match press conference on Friday. “He’s still suffering with his hamstring.”

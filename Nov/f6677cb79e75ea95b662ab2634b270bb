The federal government will consider “options” to stop the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) from continuing its industrial action. Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, spoke on a Channels Television’s Politics Today on Friday. “There are so many options left. We have the labour laws and I have options left to me in the labour laws. I have other channels,” he said. Ngige complained that the union was not considering the challenges their demands would create. The minister said even if countries go to war, they eventually meet at the negotiation table. “I’m inviting them (ASUU) next week, we are doing side meetings on our part. I’m collating responses from the Accountant General of the Federation’s Office and everybody who has something to do with this matter.” On the return of students to classes, Ngige said he was hopeful that it would not take long. Ngige expressed optimism that talks will be concluded next week. Ngige confirmed that government had agreed to try out University Transparency Academic Solution (UTAS), the payment platform ASUU proposed when it turned down the Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS). The former Anambra State Governor said National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) had completed the first phase of UTAS assessment.

Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose has urged the Deputy Governor of Ondo State, Agboola Ajayi to return to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ajayi was Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) candidate in the Ondo governorship election. A statement on Saturday by Fayose’s spokesperson, Lere Olayinka, said the duo met in Afao-Ekiti Friday night. The PDP chieftain told Ajayi to put the past behind and rejoin the party to make it stronger in Ondo. Fayose called Ajayi a force to be reckoned with in the politics of the state, adding that he will thrive better in a “mainstream and liberal” platform. “The best option before you now is to return to the PDP and I am encouraging you to give it a consideration because you need the party and the party too needs a strong political character like you,” Fayose said. In his remarks, Ajayi described Fayose as a clear minded personality, who speaks regardless of whose ox is gored. “I have come to Afao Ekiti at this hour of the day to wish a friend, brother and leader a happy birthday at 60. Fayose is one person I have great respect for. “I will continue to relate with him because he is not someone who will not tell you A when he means B. His yes is yes and when he says no, he means no,” Ajayi said. The Deputy Governor dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC) for the PDP following his disagreement with Governor Rotimi Ajeredolu. He later defected to the ZLP after losing the gubernatorial ticket to Eyitayo Jegede. Akeredolu defeated Jegede and Ajayi at the polls in October.

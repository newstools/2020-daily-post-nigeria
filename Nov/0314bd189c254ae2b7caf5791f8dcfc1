Uti Nwachukwu, ex-Big Brother Africa reality show star, has revealed that Jesus Christ would be disappointed in Nigerians who are in support of US President, Donald Trump, all in the name of Christianity. The Big Brother Africa, BBA, winner, said Jesus will be disappointed with those supporting Trump because he clearly perpetuated hate, division and anarchy.
“I’m so ashamed of the hypocritical brainwashed Nigerians supporting Trump all in the name of Christianity! “Someone that clearly perpetuated hate, division and anarchy!! “This is who you people were holding vigils for? Is this the love Jesus preached? He will be so disappointed. “If you ever tweeted or shouted End SARS and you are a trump supporter all in the name of Christianity, then you are part of our main problem in Nigeria. “You are part of the reason why we have suffered injustice and bad governance in Nigeria! You disgust me and you all are hypocrites,” he said. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-853849 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-08-at-1.36.13-PM-958x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="740" height="791" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-08-at-1.36.13-PM-958x1024.jpeg 958w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-08-at-1.36.13-PM-281x300.jpeg 281w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-08-at-1.36.13-PM-560x600.jpeg 560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WhatsApp-Image-2020-11-08-at-1.36.13-PM.jpeg 1010w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

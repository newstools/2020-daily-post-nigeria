Juventus manager, Andrea Pirlo, has said there is no special treatment for Cristiano Ronaldo in his team. Ronaldo scored twice in their 2-0 win over Cagliari last weekend, taking his tally to eight goals in six matches this season. The Portuguese superstar has scored 29 of Juve’s 59 league goals during the calendar year. Ronaldo is now fully fit, like fellow forwards, Paulo Dybala and Alvaro Morata. Dybala is back fit after injury, while Morata has scored six goals since returning to the club in September on loan from Atletico Madrid. Pirlo was asked about his trio, and most notably Ronaldo, whom he insists is not afforded any special treatment despite his huge salary and overall value to the club. “I treat him like I treat all the other players,” he told a press conference. “I’m always available on and off the pitch. “It’s easy to have a good relationship between humble people. I’m like that. “I behave with him – a champion – like I do with [Gianluca] Frabotta or [Manolo] Portanova, who are two young players. “I do the same things I was used to doing when I was a player.”

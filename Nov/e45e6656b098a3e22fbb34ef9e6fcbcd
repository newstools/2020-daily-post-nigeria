The final words of Argentina football legend, Diego Maradona, were: “I don’t feel well.” SportingLife reports Maradona went back to bed after breakfast, telling his nephew Johnny Esposito that he was not feeling well and wanted to lie down again. A nurse who was looking after him following his release from the hospital called for an ambulance and several responded. But Maradona was already dead by the time they arrived. An autopsy is expected to show the 60-year-old died from a massive heart attack. Prosecution chief John Broyad, speaking as Maradona’s body was taken to the morgue for an autopsy, said: “The forensic police began their work at 4pm. No signs of any criminality or violence have been detected. “The autopsy is being carried out to determine beyond any doubt the cause of death but we can say at this stage that everything is pointing to natural causes.”

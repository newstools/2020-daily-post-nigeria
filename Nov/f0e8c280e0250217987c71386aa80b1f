Senator Ali Ndume has eulogised former President Goodluck Jonathan. At the weekend in Abuja, he apologized for criticising his adminisration strongly. The Borno South lawmaker stated: “Nigerians don’t value what they have until they lose it.” Ndume made the comment at the launch of a book written by Dr. Susana Adams. “I want to appreciate Mr. President (Jonathan). As they say, you never know what you have until you lose it. Nigerians now know that”, he said. The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain thanked God for the former Bayelsa Governor’s life. Ndume noted that Jonathan changed the political culture and landscape of this country. “You don’t know how great you are in the eyes of those that were skeptical, those that didn’t know you and those that did not come close to you,” he added. The Senator further recalled his legal battle over alleged ties with the Boko Haram sect. Ndume narrated his arrest and detention by the Department of State Services (DSS). “I went to court for six years. When I was vindicated, I had the opportunity to run into him (Jonathan). He said, ‘Ndume, you have been patient and God has vindicated you, take this as a part of blessings from the Almighty’.” Jonathan was at the event also attended by former Minister of Information, Labaran Maku, among others.

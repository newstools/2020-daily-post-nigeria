The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has asked the Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, not to hide under the disagreements in his party to shy away from explaining how N4.6 billion public fund was diverted in his ministry. PDP described as disheartening a situation where a minister failed to explain the alleged payment of funds in 654 tranches to 21 private bank accounts in a space of two months. The party stated this in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan. According to PDP: “Fashola has failed to respond to Nigerians inquisitions on how he allegedly oversaw such a corrupt system, which points to why our nation’s power, housing and road infrastructure sector had remained in shambles despite the huge resources allocated during the tenure. “Instead, what we see are attempts to use primordial discussion related to disagreements in the APC to divert attention from the fraud allegation. “It is rather pathetic that Fashola is still in his political pipe dream under a rejected All Progressives Congress (APC) when the people have moved on even as Nigerians of goodwill are already rallying on the platform of our party for solutions to the myriads of problems brought upon our nation by the APC.”

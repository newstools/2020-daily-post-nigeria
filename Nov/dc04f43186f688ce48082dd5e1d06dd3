Nigeria’s Minister of Finance, Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed, has given a clear hint that the country’s land borders may be reopened soon. The borders that have been closed since August 2019. But speaking to State House correspondents on Wednesday, Ahmed said the presidential committee set up on the matter has completed its job and has recommended its reopening. She said the committee would soon submit its report to President Muhammadu Buhari, following which a formal pronouncement would be made on the matter. Ahmed however did not reveal when the report will be submitted and how soon the land borders will be reopened. Nigeria closed its land borders last year, in a bid to curtail illegal importation of drugs, small arms and agricultural products into the country from neighbouring West African nations.

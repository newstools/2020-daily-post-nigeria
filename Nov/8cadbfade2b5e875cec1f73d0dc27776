Cesc Fabregas has named Granit Xhaka among five “top, top players” at his former club, Arsenal. Xhaka looked to be on his way out of the Emirates at one stage, after his outburst towards Gunners fans led to him being stripped of the captaincy. But since Mikel Arteta came in as manager, the Swiss midfielder has revived his career to become a regular feature in the side. And Fabregas considers the 28-year-old in Arsenal’s top bracket of players, along Willian, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Thomas Partey and Dani Ceballos. “They have [Dani] Ceballos, they have Xhaka, now they’ve added Thomas Partey from Atletico, who’s a very good player as well. “They have Willian, they have [Pierre-Emerick] Aubameyang – top, top players, that’s 100 per cent sure,” Fabregas told 90min.

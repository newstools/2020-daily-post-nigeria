Security agencies are in frantic search of 50 AK-47 rifles allegedly carted away by members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Oyigbo Local Government area of Rivers State. Commissioner for Information and Communications in the State, Paulinus Nsirim made the claims while briefing Government House Correspondents in Port Harcour after the government eased the curfew in Oyigbo. Rivers State Security Council relaxed the 24-hour curfew imposed on the entire Oyigbo Local Government Area of the State following the killing of 10 security operatives allegedly by members of the proscribed IPOB. The Council agreed that the curfew would now take effect from 7pm to 6am beginning from Wednesday. But Nsirim, while addressing newsmen on the eased curfew explained that, “during the mayhem that claimed the lives of security agents carrying out their legitimate duties in Oyigbo, 50 AK 47 rifles were carted away. “And as a result of this, security agencies in the area would continue to embark on surveillance and search operations to recover the rifles which are now in the illegal possession of some persons. “You will recall that following the killing of six soldiers and four policemen, and the destruction of court buildings by members of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the Rivers State Government imposed a 24 hour curfew on the entire Oyigbo Local Government Area on October 21, 2020.” This disclosure comes as the State Governor, Nyesom Wike announced the arrest of two kingpins of IPOB in Oyigbo by security operatives.

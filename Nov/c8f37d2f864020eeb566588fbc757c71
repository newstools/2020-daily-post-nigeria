President Muhammadu Buhari has commended the defection of Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Nigerian leader described it “as a bold move driven purely by principle rather than opportunistic motives”. Buhari noted that he knows people will call him names, but that is the price men of principles have to pay for acting according to their conscience and conviction. His reaction was contained in a statement Wednesday night by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu. Buhari said: “I am proud of Governor David Umahi for taking this bold decision in accordance with his conscience and principles rather than any external influence or coercion. “Good governance is very important to us in the APC, and I’m glad that the governor has cited this as a major factor in his decision to join us. I urge our citizens to pay less emphasis on identity politics if we want our democracy to make a positive impact on our country. “With men like Umahi, I foresee a brighter future for our democracy because the voters will be more motivated by performance records of parties and their candidates. “Let me once again; commend the boldness of Governor Umahi for taking this courageous decision in a country where principles are in short supply among many.”

Lagos Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has explained why the government is repealing the state pensions law. He spoke on Tuesday at the 2021 budget presentation at the House of Assembly. Sanwo-Olu disclosed that a bill to abrogate the law will be sent to the legislature “in a couple of weeks”. The pension covers former Lagos governors and deputy governors. Sanwo-Olu explained that the decision was due to a decrease in income. “The repeal of the act is due to the dwindling revenue to the state government’s account,” he said. More than 20 of the 36 states in Nigeria take care of former leaders with public funds. This is inspite of poverty, unemployment, and infrastructure deficit.

A medical doctor has been arraigned before a Yola Chief Magistrate for allegedly raping a married woman. The doctor who owns a private clinic and also works at the Adamawa State Specialist Hospital, Yola, allegedly raped the woman in the course of medical checks in his private clinic. The suspect, Dr Phillips Duru, came before the court on Thursday, with the police prosecution specifying that the doctor perpetuated the act in the lab of his private clinic located near the state Specialist Hospital. After preliminary hearing of the case, the presiding Magistrate, Aliyu Bawuro, adjourned further hearing to November 26. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), DSP Sulaiman Nguroje, who spoke on the suspect, said the plaintiff had reported the alleged rape, prompting the police to take it up. “It’s true. The matter was reported to the police through a complaint by the victim who said she and her husband visited the Specialist Hospital and met the doctor over a health challenge,” Nguroje said. He added that the man was invited and then charged to court after due investigation.

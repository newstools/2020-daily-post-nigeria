The Campaign Organisation of Mr Babatunde Gbadamosi, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Senatorial Candidate for the forthcoming Lagos East bye-election, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies to ensure that only qualified people are allowed to vote. The Media Director of the Campaign Organisation, Dr Adetokunbo Pearse, made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at the weekend while reacting to the rescheduling of earlier postponed bye-elections in the country for Dec. 5. Pearse noted that the INEC had no choice than to postpone the Lagos East Senatorial and Kosefe Constituency II bye-elections earlier fixed for October 31 due to the security situation. “INEC cannot conduct elections without security,” Pearse said. “Now that it has fixed the date, the important thing is for INEC to do the right thing: allow the votes to count and make sure that people who don’t qualify don’t vote. “We remain on the fact that Abiru, (the Lagos East APC candidate) has 2 PVCs (Permanent Voter Cards) and that he did not register in the Lagos East Senatorial District, hence he’s not qualified to run for the election. “If anyone votes illegally, such has committed a crime. “We’re fully prepared, everybody knows that Gbadamosi, the PDP candidate, is the better candidate, who came in a democratic fashion, and whose commitment is to improve the quality of lives of the people,” he added.

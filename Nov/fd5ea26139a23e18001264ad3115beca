Portugal captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, has reacted to his side’s 1-0 UEFA Nations League defeat to France on Saturday in Lisbon. N’Golo Kante’s second-half strike helped France to reach the competition’s final four at the expense of Portugal. Anthony Martial missed three clear-cut first-half chances for the World Cup holders before Kante scored his second international goal in the 54th minute for France. Reacting, Ronaldo said it was unfortunate for Portugal not to achieve their goal by beating France, adding that all games teach his team something. In a post via his Instagram account, Ronaldo said: “All games teach us something. “Unfortunately, we did not achieve our goal. “We have to raise our heads and be proud of everything we have been achieving together!”

The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) told students to prepare for resumption next week. ASUU said this on its official Twitter page as the education body expressed hope of an agreement with the federal government. The Union expressed optimism that students would return to universities next week after its meeting with the federal government. The tweet read: “ All Federal University students should prepare for resumption as we expect a positive outcome from ASUU on Wednesday.” This is coming after the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, on Friday, expressed the hope that the agreement with the Union will be concluded next week. Ngige lamented that ASUU was not considering the challenges their demands would create. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-854741" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_3916.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="696" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_3916.jpg 828w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_3916-300x252.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px">

Aisha Yesufu, co-convener of BringBackOurGirls, BBOG, advocacy group, has lamented the recent killing of over 43 farmers by members of the dreaded Islamic sect, Boko Haram. The activist totally blamed President Muhammadu Buhari for the spate of insecurity in the North. According to Yesufu, Northerners gave Buhari everything including votes and love but the President in exchange gave the region nothing but death and destruction. DAILY POST reported earlier that about 43 farmers were beheaded by Boko Haram terrorists in Zabarmari,Borno state. The North have been ravaged with kidnappings and killings carried out by bandits and Boko Haram terrorists. In a tweet on Sunday, Yesufu said, “Northern people gave Buhari everything and Buhari gave them nothing! “Northern people gave Buhari votes and Buhari gave them destruction, Northern people gave Buhari love and Buhari gave them tears. “Northern people gave Buhari support and Buhari gave them death #ZabarmariMassacre.”

Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes, has called on his Red Devils team-mates to step their game up after they edged to a 1-0 victory against West Brom in the Premier League over the weekend at Old Trafford. Fernandes used his usual hop-and-play style when Man United was awarded a penalty in the 56th minute against West Brom on Saturday night. West Brom goalkeeper, Sam Johnstone, saved Fernandes’s first effort, only for the officials to order a retake as he had strayed off his line early. Not deterred by his initial miss, Fernandes repeated the trick again and scored the winner for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men. Speaking ahead of Man United’s Champions League clash against Istanbul Basaksehir on Tuesday, after the game, Fernandes said as quoted by Man United’s official website: “Of course it is really important to us to win this game. “First of all not because it was our first league win at Old Trafford but because we needed to get points in the league. “It was a tough game. We can do much better. We created a lot, but we have the qualities to do much better.”

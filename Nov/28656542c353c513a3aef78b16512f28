The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command has apprehended a drunk Inspector in a viral video. The policeman was recorded while intoxicated at CBN junction in Abuja. A statement on Sunday by ASP Yusuf Mariam, Public Relations Officer, confirmed his arrest. The spokesman said the Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, has ordered that the officer be subjected to psychological and medical evaluation. This is preparatory to the commencement of disciplinary actions against him. Ciroma noted that the behaviour portrayed in the video “does not depict the standard discipline of the Nigeria Police Force”. The CP reiterated FCT command’s commitment to the protection of lives and property.

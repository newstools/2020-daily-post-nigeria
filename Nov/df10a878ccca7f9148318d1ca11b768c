Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has called on the Premier League to ban the unorthodox penalty routine used by players like Bruno Fernandes. Wright feels their techniques are “not fair”. Fernandes used his usual hop-and-play style when Manchester United was awarded a penalty in the 56th minute against West Brom on Saturday. Baggies’ goalkeeper, Sam Johnstone, saved Fernandes’s first effort, only for the officials to order a retake as he had strayed off his line early. Not deterred by his initial miss, Fernandes repeated the trick again and scored the winner. “It is [difficult for goalkeepers],” Wright said on BBC’s Match of the Day. “And then you’ve got forwards jumping up, doing this, doing that sort of stuff and the goalie can’t move his foot off. “They should stop people jumping and that, they should have to make a full… just run at the ball and hit it. If they can move and the goalies can’t, that’s not fair.” Presenter Gary Lineker asked: “Are you going to have a law that says you can’t jump?”

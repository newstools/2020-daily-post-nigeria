Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has said that Lagos State, as well as the entire country, needs healing. Osinbajo, during his visit to Lagos State yesterday on behalf of President Muhammadu Buhari, assured that there would be comprehensive justice for all Nigerians affected by police brutality and the crisis that greeted the End SARS protests. Osinbajo gave the assurance on Monday in Lagos State at the launch of the Rebuild Lagos Trust Fund. The VP extended the Federal Government’s “commiserations to the government and people of Lagos State for the loss of lives of citizens, the injured, and the colossal destruction of public and private properties, social amenities and infrastructure.” Lagos was both the epicenter of the #ENDSARS protests and the destruction that followed a few weeks ago. “Noting the unfortunate loss of lives and property in Lagos and across the country,” added Osinbajo. “Our State, like our Nation, is in need of healing. We recognize that the balm for a wounded society is truth and justice.” The Vice President pointed out that this was why judicial panels of inquiry were established all across Nigeria. He said the tasks for the Lagos panel was expanded to include a full investigation of the Lekki toll gate incidents. Osinbajo vowed that all those responsible for the ugly events that happened in the State and across the country will be brought to justice.

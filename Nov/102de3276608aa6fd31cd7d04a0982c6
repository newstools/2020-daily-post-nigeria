The Academic Staff Union of University, ASUU, has highlighted reasons its protracted strike may continue for years. Professor Olu Olufayo, the Coordinator of ASUU in Akure Zone, said the strike may linger for years if the federal government refuses to honour its agreement with the union. Olufayo disclosed this during a press conference at ASUU Secretariat in Obafemi Awolowo University Campus on Friday. He stressed that ASUU would remain on strike until the Nigerian government meets its demands with respect to implementing the 2009 agreement. Olufayo also called on the federal government to declare a state of emergency on the education sector in Nigeria. According to Olufayo: “It is unfortunate that the government in the country does not care about the quality of education available for the children of ordinary Nigerians since their children schooled abroad, hence, their refusal to honour the various agreements reached with ASUU for almost eleven years. “We have also resolved to remain on strike for as long as possible to ensure that the Federal government commit to the agreement and take concrete steps towards ensuring quality public university education in the country. “We have told the FG to declare a state of emergency in the education sector, shut the schools for two or even five years within which it can fix the problem in the sector and ensure quality education in the country.”

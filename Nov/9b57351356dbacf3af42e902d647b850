The operatives of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Taskforce) have explained why over 1,700 illegal shanties and containerised shops around Fagba Railway lines, Agege were destroyed at the weekend. The Agency’s Head, Public Affairs Unit, Adebayo Taofiq, in a statement made available to newsmen in Lagos at the weekend, said the demolition was necessitated based on series of complaints about criminal activities around Fagba, Agege after the recent ‘EndSARS’ protest. According to the statement, the Chairman of the Agency, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi had served occupants of those illegal structures a 7-day ‘Removal Order’ by the government. “This is necessitated based on a series of complaints about criminal activities around Fagba, Agege,” the statement read. “These illegal shanties and containerised shops are occupied by miscreants and hoodlums who terrorise innocent citizens around Fagba, Iju-Ishaga and Pen-Cinema area, dispossessing them of their valuables. “Investigations conducted also revealed that these miscreants and hoodlums were responsible for the destruction of public properties and looting of shops after the recent ‘EndSARS’ protest around Agege. “It is an eyesore with miscreants and hoodlums freely smoking and selling Indian hemp including prostitution by under-age boys and girls around Fagba railway lines,” he added. Egbeyemi enjoined members of the public to support the government in salvaging Lagos State from the clutches of notorious criminals by reporting noticeable criminal activities to security agencies. The Chairman also confirmed that suspected illegal substances and dangerous drugs such as Indian hemp, codeine, skunk and tramadol were recovered during the demolition exercise.

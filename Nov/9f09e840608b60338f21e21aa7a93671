The Minister of Youth and Sports Development, Sunday Dare, has hinted that the head coach of the Super Eagles could be sacked after their Africa Cup of Nations qualifier in Sierra Leone on Tuesday. When both sides first met on Friday, Nigeria surrendered a four-goal lead at half time to draw 4-4 with the Leone Stars. Dare has expressed his disappointment at the team’s collapse and demanded a response in Freetown. He however deferred comments on the suitability or otherwise of Gernot Rohr as manager of the team. “The task at the moment is to get the team firmly back on track towards picking one of the group’s two tickets on offer for the 2022 AFCON. “A win in Freetown will seal a 19th participation in the African Mundial. “After this, we can now debate Mr. Rohr’s suitability as we seek to return Nigeria to the pedestal of African football and one of the beautiful game’s powerhouses in world football. “We will reappraise Mr. Rohr’s performance since he was named as Super Eagles manager and see if he is the right man to fulfill our expectations,” Dare said according to Sporting Life.

The Police Command in Yobe on Thursday said it has arrested three suspects for allegedly raping two 13-year-old girls in Damaturu and Potiskum Local Government Areas of the state. The Command’s Public Relations Officer, DSP Dungus Abdulkarim, made this known while presenting the suspects in Damaturu. According to him, the names of the three suspects are as follows: Musa Ibrahim, Adamu Abdulllahi and Usman Goni. He said Ibrahim and Abdullahi, both tricycle operators, allegedly lured one of the minors with money and gang-raped her near Danchuwa village in Potiskum. “Investigation revealed that the girl boarded Ibrahim’s Keke Napep. He now invited Abdullahi and the duo took her to a bush around Danchuwa and had carnal knowledge of her,” Abdulkarim said. The spokesman said the case was transferred to the command from Potiskum Divisional Office on Oct. 27.

Abdulkarim said the incident occurred when the girl moved into the suspect’s house to assist her nursing mother with domestic chores. The spokesman further said the suspects would be charged to court after police investigations.

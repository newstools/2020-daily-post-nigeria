Anambra State Government said it is saddened by the death of two of its prominent sons, Igwe Alex Nwokedi, the traditional ruler of Achalla Kingdom in Awka North Local Government Area, and a renowned highlife musician, Chief Emeka Maduka, who is most popularly known as Morocco. In a statement signed by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr C. Don Adinuba, and made available to DAILY POST in Awka, the state government extolled the virtues of Igwe Nwokedi and Maduka. On Nwokedi, Adinuba wrote; “He had earlier served exceedingly well as the General Manager of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and Chief Press Secretary to General Olusegun Obasanjo when the latter was the military Head of State from 1976 to 1979; he is still considered by many Nigerians to be the best press secretary to serve any Nigerian leader. “Nwokedi’s ascendancy to the throne of his ancestors in a rural community inspired a generation of highly accomplished professionals in various endeavours to aspire to lead their communities, no matter the level of development. “ He mentioned the current chairman of the Anambra State Council of Traditional Rulers, Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Achebe, the Obi of Onitsha, the recently deceased Eze 11 of Ndikelionwu in Orumba North Local Government Area, Professor Vincent Chukwuemeka Ike, and Professor Laz Ekwueme, who sits on the throne of Oko community in Orumba North Local Government Area as some of those inspired by Late Nwokedi. On Maduka, the commissioner also extolled his accomplishments saying he began his music career as a village minstrel singer but ended up as a celebrated highlife musician. “Morocco represents the typical Anambra person: an infectious determination to not only succeed but also excel in any chosen field, regardless of the humble beginnings. Maduka recorded some 120 albums,” Adinuba said.

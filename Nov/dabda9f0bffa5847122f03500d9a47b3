Felix Uduokhai, a player of Nigerian descent, has been handed his maiden invitation to the Germany national team. Joachim Low’s team will face Czech Republic, Ukraine and Spain this month. Uduokhai’s invitation to Low’s latest squad comes as a blow to Nigeria, who were aiming to lure him. The 23-year-old who was born to a Nigerian father and a German mother in the European country, has featured across Germany youth levels with appearances for the U19, U20 and U21 teams. Uduokhai has been impressive in Augsburg’s defence this campaign, playing every minute of their Bundesliga matches so far this season and has scored one goal. Germany will face the Czech Republic in a friendly match in Leipzig next Wednesday, before resuming their UEFA Nations League campaign against Ukraine and Spain on November 14 and 17 respectively.

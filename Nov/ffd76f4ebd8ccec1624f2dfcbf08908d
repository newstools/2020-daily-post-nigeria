Arsenal centre back, Rob Holding, has played down the alleged training ground fight between teammates, David Luiz and Dani Ceballos. Luiz and Ceballos did not travel for international duty and continued training at London Colney over the last fortnight. During a session, it is claimed that Luiz was unhappy with a challenge made by Ceballos and reacted by hitting the Spanish midfielder on the nose, drawing some blood. However, speaking on the development ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Leeds United on Sunday, Holding insisted that the incident was just a bit of competitiveness. “It’s just competitive training, that’s all we want it to be,” Holding told Sky Sports. “We want it to be match-like, you have got to train as if it’s a match. “You want to fight and compete for the ball. If it goes over [and] it can’t go over, it can’t go over, and it’s displaying something that’s not part of the game. “Everything that happened was just competitive tackling and just a bit of competitiveness with the boys, which I think is not a problem at all.” Asked if the players are friends again, Holding added: “Yeah, everyone’s friends again, everyone’s laughing and joking. It’s all good.”

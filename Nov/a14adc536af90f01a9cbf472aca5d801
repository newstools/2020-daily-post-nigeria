Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has issued a warning to President Muhammadu Buhari over his refusal to order a referendum. Kanu warned that Nigerians would consider order options to ensure secession, if Buhari refused to conduct a referendum. In a series of tweets, the IPOB leader maintained that sovereignty is taken and not given. According to Kanu: “Sovereignty is not given, it is taken – Atatürk of Turkey. “Now, I say unto @NGRPresident, that if you don’t concede to a Referendum for the peaceful dissolution of Nigeria, there will come a time when the indigenous peoples of #Nigeria will consider other options. #WeMove “Separation comes with quantum benefits. Soviet Union, Ethiopia, Czechoslovakia, etc suffered when they were held in unity by force.” He also noted that Nigeria would benefit more when there is a secession. “But now that they are separated, the new nations prospered more than the old. #Nigeria needs to learn that separation can be beneficial to all,” he added.

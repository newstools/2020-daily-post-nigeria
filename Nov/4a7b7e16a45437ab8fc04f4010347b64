The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Nsukka Zone, has kicked against the alleged attempt by the management of Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT), to use the military to conduct examinations in the institution. Dr Igbana Ajir, the Zonal Coordinator Nsukka zone, made the condemnation at the University of Nigeria Nsukka, UNN, while briefing newsmen shortly after ASUU zonal meeting on Friday. Ajir said that the recent move by Prof Charles Eze, the Vice-chancellor, to call in the military to force students to write the 2019/2020 first semester examination is not only barbaric but negates the civil university traditions. “The attempt to use military men to force students to write the examination in ESUT is totally unacceptable and condemnable. “The union will not hesitate to deploy relevant instruments to sanction ESUT if the institution continues to pressure and deny salary to our members who oppose this uncivil act,” he said. Speaking on the ongoing nationwide strike by university lecturers, Ajir pointed out that the government must reasonably meet ASUU demands before the strike will be suspended. He said this was because the government agreed and signed to meet all of them in 2009.

Uchenna Okogbuo, the Deputy National Chairman of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Southern Nigeria, has commended Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, for scrapping the controversial Pandemic Prevention Fee of N15,000 imposed on students of Abia State University (ABSU). Recall that the Management of Abia State University, (ABSU), had asked students to pay N15,000 of Pandemic Prevention Fee before allowing them into the campuses. The varsity authority said that the fee was aimed at ensuring steady provision of COVID-19 preventive equipment to halt any spread of the coronavirus to students of the institution. But, while interacting with newsmen in Umuahia, on Saturday, Uchenna Okogbuo, said democracy is all about having respect for the views of the masses, adding that he believed in commending the Governor when he performs creditably aside political divides or affiliations. Okogbuo pointed out that it would have been insensitive if the state government had allowed the fee to stand despite the high cost of school fees in the institution, advising the government to cut down the school fees especially as the economic downturn bits harder on parents. The APGA chieftain enjoined the State Government to be sensitive in other dilapidated areas in the state begging for attention especially, payment of salaries of Secondary School Teachers, Health Workers in the state under the aegis of the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) who are currently on strike among others. Okogbuo, who also said Abia State belongs to all, noted that his suggestions and contributions are meant towards the betterment of the state, stressing that if the present administration listen and engage technocrats in all they do, the state will surmount the myriad challenges it is faced with today which has relegated development. He also rejoined the numerous supporters of APGA to be patient, remain focused and most importantly be prayerful as God has listened to their cries, stating that 2023 will mark the liberation of Abia through the ballot.

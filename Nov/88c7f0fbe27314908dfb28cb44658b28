I’ve apologised but I need you guys to help me beg her she’s my backbone “I’ve excelled in so many other things but marriage I’ve been failing. But please help me save this marriage and beg my wife.” Instead of bringing home the Grammys as promised 9ice has been busy scoring away goals pic.twitter.com/upaBWCBaN0 —  .

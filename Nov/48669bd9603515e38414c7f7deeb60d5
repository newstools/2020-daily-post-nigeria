Former England striker, Michael Owen, is predicting a stalemate when Manchester City host Liverpool at the Etihad on Sunday. City are seeking a fourth successive home win over the Premier League champions. Jurgen Klopp’s side will also be without Virgil van Dijk, while Pep Guardiola’s defensive issues have been well documented. Owen told BetVictor: “I can’t wait for this one! Last season’s top two do battle in what I expect to be an enthralling encounter at the Etihad. “There have been over 2.5 goals in 9 of Liverpool’s last 10 league matches, and I can see that trend continuing here with both sides playing out a score draw.” Owen also feels Arsenal will enjoy a comfortable win over Aston Villa in the late kick-off. Dean Smith’s side have lost two on the bounce ahead of their trip to the Emirates. “This will be another tough one for Villa, and I expect Arsenal to have their tails up. I fancy the good vibes to continue for the home side with a comfortable win against the Villains,” he added.

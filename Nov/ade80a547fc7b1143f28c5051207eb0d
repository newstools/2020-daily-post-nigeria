Former Liverpool defender, Jamie Carragher, has said he does not believe that Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, is a great player. He said the Red Devils should consider selling Pogba, adding that the Frenchman cannot compare to Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard or Yaya Toure. Pogba has battled injury and COVID-19 and has struggled for consistent first-team minutes in recent months. The 27-year-old has started from the bench in United’s past two matches, a loss at Istanbul Basaksehir and a win at Everton at the weekend. “Would I pick him in the Manchester United team? No, I wouldn’t. He’s a huge name, he’s come for a huge transfer fee, but I don’t think he’s a great player,” Carragher told talkSPORT. “People say he’s won the World Cup and I get that. But when he came in I thought he might have the impact like Lampard at Chelsea, Gerrard at Liverpool, Yaya Toure at Man City – those players drove their team to titles, European Cups. “It just hasn’t happened for him at Manchester United. For me, I’d be looking to move him on.”

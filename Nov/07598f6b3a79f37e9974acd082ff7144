A former Liverpool player, John Barnes, wants the club to sign Napoli defender, Kalidou Koulibaly, next year. According to him, the Senegalese would be a perfect partner with Virgil van Dijk, who is currently injured. He stated this ahead of Liverpool’s Champions League clash with Ajax on Tuesday. “If Koulibaly comes [to Liverpool], he is a player that could play alongside Van Dijk when he returns [from injury] so it would be easy to talk Koulibaly into joining Liverpool, unlike some other top players because he is a person that if he comes would go straight into the first team and play every match,” Barnes told BonusCodeBets. “Aside from Koulibaly, I do not think there is anyone out there that Liverpool would look to get in January. “If Liverpool are unable to get anyone to improve the first team then why sign a new player? “January is not always the best time to buy because all of the top players you want to come into your team are going to be in the Champions League still so it might be hard to convince them to come if they are not going to be playing every week. “If Liverpool are desperate and need somebody, they will get them in. But I do not think Jurgen Klopp is a particular fan of buying in January, obviously, the situation determines what happens come January if they are top and not conceding too many goals, maybe they do not need to do that. “In January you can spend a lot of money and not necessarily improve the squad.”

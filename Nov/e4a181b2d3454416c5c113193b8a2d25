Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle of Zamfara State has supervised the passing out of 1,350 Special Police Constables from the Police College, Sokoto and another 1200 from the Police College, Kaduna today. The Constables including five women are the first batch of 7,500 to be trained and posted to Zamfara State to assist the Police and the Military to curb the growing menace of banditry in the state. This was contained in a press statement signed and made available to newsmen in Gusau, Zamfara State by the Special Adviser to the governor on media and public enlightenment, Hon. Zailani Bappa. According to the statement, Governor Matawalle said with the ban of the unlawful ‘Yan Sa Kai’ vigilantes, the trained young men and women will replace their function by assisting the Police in critical areas of intelligence gathering, peace and reconciliation as well as arresting miscreants. “I have made it clear that we shall fight crime in the state within the confines of the law. These graduands will work under the supervision of the Police to help rid our communities of crimes”, Matawalle declared. However, the Commandant of the Police College, Alhaji Kabir Mohammed said the passing out of the young men and women was a significant step in the drive towards the development of community Policing which is much desired at this critical time. He said all those who passed out were found worthy of the commissioning as they were graded well in training, discipline and learning.

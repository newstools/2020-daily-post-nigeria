Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has confirmed that goalkeeper, David de Gea sustained a knock on his knee during his side’s 3-2 win against Southampton in the Premier League on Sunday. De Gea was injured during the first half against Southampton, as he tried to save James Ward-Prowse’s free-kick which eventually crept in to make it 2-0 for the host. The Spaniard failed to reappear for the second half and was replaced by Dean Henderson as Man United eventually defeated Southampton, thanks to a goal from Bruno Fernandes and two goals from Edinson Cavani. Speaking after his Man United’s win against Southampton ahead of his side’s Champions League clash with Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday, Solskjaer told BBC Sport, “He [De Gea] probably wasn’t able to warm up on the pitch, and then he realised he needed bigger studs. “Hopefully it’s not too bad. It’s a knock on his knee – just above his knee – so we will see how it is. “He has to be ready [for the PSG clash]!”

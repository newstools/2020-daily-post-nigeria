The Adamawa State Government has reviewed the 12-hour curfew in the state to eight hours. The curfew, which was previously effective from 6pm to 8am, now takes effect from 10pm to 6am. The curfew was 24 hours when it was imposed last week, Sunday, October 25, after youths started a looting orgy in the name of End SARS protests. It was first relaxed last Thursday, October 29, and movement allowed between 8am and 6pm. Making the latest review Monday afternoon, Governor Ahmadu Fintiri said in a statement released by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Humwashi Wonosikou, that the fresh review was in response to cooperation from citizens who, in addition to complying with directive to return looted items, have kept law and order. “We as a people are resolute to move this state forward, “Fintiri said, expressing his appreciation to traditional, community and religious leaders for their peace-building initiatives during the period. “As we put this event behind us, I assure you that I will not relent but ensure that all we have set to achieve are achieved,” the governor said. In an event earlier on Monday at the Government House, Yola, the governor had said that about 90 per cent of looted items had been returned. He appreciated visiting local government chairmen for ensuring that End SARS looting did not extend to their domains.

The Minister of Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola, has warned the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to honour the agreement reached at the formative stage of the party, ahead of the 2023 general elections. Fashola stated this while chatting with journalists covering the APC Press Corps in Abuja on Tuesday. The former Lagos Governor admitted there was an APC agreement on zoning which he said should be honoured. When asked about the zoning arrangement, Fashola said, “The truth is that what makes an agreement spectacular is the honour in which it is made, not whether it is written. If it was written there would be no Court cases of breach of contract because it’s a document that is written and signed that goes to court. But the private agreement you make with your brother and sister should not be breached, it must be honoured.” Though he argued that zoning may not be found in the party’s constitution, he noted that party leaders at the formative stage entered into agreement which must be honoured. According to him, “All political parties are clubs where you write agreements just like a social club and we can decide that it is the youngest person who will be the Chairman of the Club or we can decide that it is the oldest person or the next female or the next male, that is the matter of agreement between people.”

Former Manchester United star, Roy Keane, has slammed striker, Edinson Cavani, following the Red Devils’ Premier League 3-2 victory against Southampton on Sunday. Keane said that Cavani was “mind-boggling” and was not ready to come on at half time against Southampton. Man United defeated Southampton, thanks to a goal from Bruno Fernandes and a late brace from Cavani. “Yeah he [Cavani] was obviously slow getting onto the pitch with them boots,” Keane said on Sky Sports. “Just as well he did score because how the guy is not prepared and ready to go on, it’s mind-boggling. “Obviously, he didn’t need the boots in the end, scored with two headers, but a great contribution when he came on. “Obviously, he still has that quality and that hunger and desire. “I think it was always a gamble when he came to the club,” Keane added.

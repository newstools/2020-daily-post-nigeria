Amalgamated Union of Foodstuff and Cattle Dealers of Nigeria has demanded that those responsible for the death of hundreds of their cattle be fished out by the government. A meeting of the cattle dealers held in Abuja on Saturday also explained that their members in the southern Nigeria lost more than hundreds of lives and properties worth millions of Naira. The National President of the union, Comrade Muhammed Tahir Baga, said the leadership of the union mandated government to carry out forensic investigation with a view to finding the culprits behind the attack on their members in the name of EndSARS protest, so as to bring the perpetrators to book. Also at the end of the quarterly meeting which comprises leadership of the union from thirty four states and Abuja the nation’s capital, the association appealed for compensation from government. He said that failure by government to take prompt action on their demands, the union will be left with no option but to stop all sort of transportation of foodstuffs and cattle to the affected areas in the southern part of the country. Tahir Baga explained that the union was working out modalities on the possibility to embark on a nationwide industrial action if their demands are not met, adding that very soon they will announce their stand. The General Secretary of the association, Ahmed Alaramma, said that he hoped that government would listen to their demands. On its part, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), through its spokesperson, Dr. Mustapha Yushe’u Abdulra’ud said it was ready to give all necessary support in the struggle. He said NLC would not relent on its efforts to protect the interest of its members being the umbrella of all trade and labour unions in Nigeria. He assured that very soon, the labour union would meet with government to find a lasting solution to the situation.

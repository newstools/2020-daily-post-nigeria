Nigerian Senators on Monday denied hoarding palliatives in their various constituencies, saying such report coming from the former Director of Media and Publicity of President Muhammadu Buhari 2019 Presidential Campaign Committee, Engr Kailani Muhammad, was nothing short of wicked and cheap blackmail. In a statement on Monday by the Senate Spokesman, Senator Ajibola Basiru, said, palliatives meant for distribution to Nigerians by lawmakers in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic were never in custody of lawmakers. He insisted that the allegations were either wicked lies or deliberate misinformation on the part of Engr Kailani to bring lawmakers in conflict with their constituents. “Lawmakers never received any COVID-19 palliatives from Mr President or the Federal Government, at all, for onward distribution to their constituents. “While not speaking for the Governors, I make bold to say that no Federal lawmaker and indeed, no Senator received any kobo from Mr President or any food stuff or any material for that matter, talk less of hoarding them. “Rather at the Senate, we donated half of members’ salaries for the purpose of cushioning the effect of COVID 19. ” We legislators equally played our part by purchasing and distributing palliatives to people at our different constituencies. So it is quite unfortunate for Kilani Mohammed or anyone to castigate us in the public and saying what is not true”, he said. Dr Ajibola Basiru, however, cautioned against “deliberate falsehood to paint Federal Lawmakers in bad light for whatever motive.”

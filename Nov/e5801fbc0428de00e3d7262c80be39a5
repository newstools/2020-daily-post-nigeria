Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, a former Vice President and the Peoples Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in the last election, has given his major reason Nigeria slided into another recession. Atiku said this administration of President Muhammadu Buhari must swallow its pride, and accept its limitations. According to him, the present administration failed to heed to his advice and that of other well meaning citizens. Atiku said he received the confirmation of another recession, the second time in five years, with a heavy heart. “Because this could have been avoided had this administration taken heed to patriotic counsel given by myself and other well meaning Nigerians on cutting the cost of governance, saving for a rainy day, and avoiding profligate borrowing,” Atiku said in a statement he shared on Twitter on Sunday morning. The former Vice President noted that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, a second recession could have been avoided through the practice of a disciplined and prudent management of the economy. Atiku, however, said everyone must focus on solutions at the moment, adding that Nigeria needs critical leadership to guide her back to the path of economic sustainability. The former presidential candidate pointed out that it is inhumane for the government to increase the cost of goods and services that affect the poor masses, while keeping the cost of luxuries fairly stable. Atiku warned Buhari government against further borrowing for anything other than essential needs or to engage in White Elephant projects. “I urge the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to swallow its pride, and accept its limitations, so that they can open their minds to ideas, without caring who the messenger is.”

President Muhammadu Buhari’s long time friend and Islamic cleric, Muhammad Abdurrabbihi Adahama, is dead. In a statement signed by his Spokesman, Garba Shehu, Buhari expressed sadness over the death of the Kano-based community leader. The President described the deceased as a “long-time friend, and an astute and courageous scholar.” Buhari praised the late Khalifah of the Adahama clan in Kano city, whom he said openly supported his political aspirations for all the time he had been in politics. President Buhari said the story of his political odyssey will not be complete without a mention of the heroic roles of the likes of Khalifah Adahama. “On behalf of my family, government and people of Nigeria, I commiserate with the family of the deceased, his friends and admirers as well as the government and people of Kano State,” he added. The deceased is the grandfather of the President’s Senior Special Assistant on Youth Matters, Nasiru Adahama.

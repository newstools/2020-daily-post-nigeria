The Chairperson of the African Union (AU) and the President of the Republic of South Africa, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa has called for calm over growing tension between the Western Sahara and Morocco, arising from a dispute on the buffer zone. Ramaphosa in a statement on Thursday urged the two countries to ease tensions and negotiate. He called on all the parties to uphold the Settlement Plan, which provides for “a cease-fire” and the holding of a referendum for the people of Western Sahara to exercise their right to self-determination. Ramaphosa also called on the United Nation’s Secretary-General to urgently appoint a Special Envoy to the Western Saraha to address all the underlying causes of tensions and assist with finding lasting peace in that region.

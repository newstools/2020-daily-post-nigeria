Biafra Nations League, BNL has condemned the broadcast of Mr Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous people of Biafra, IPOB calling for the head of the Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike. National Deputy Leader of BNL and head of operations of the group’s BBS Media, Ebuta Takon Akor, in a statement to DAILY POST on Saturday, stated that the Biafran struggle cannot be hijacked by an individual creating problems while he remains abroad. The group admitted that Wike was wrong to have accused members of IPOB of burning down of Police station and the killing that followed it, but disassociated itself from Kanu broadcast. “We are not part of that nonsense, if we have the powers to capture those in Government then let us capture Buhari”. He advised the IPOB leader to make peace with the Igbo and Biafra groups rather than neglecting other group existence to commanding people in a broadcast, adding that he (Kanu) is creating problems for the movement due to lack of coordination. “We also make it known that we are now known as BNL and no longer BNYL, we are no longer an all youthful affairs as our elders are now honorary members of the league,” Ebuta said.

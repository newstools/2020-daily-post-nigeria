Kai Havertz has claimed he chose Chelsea over Bayern Munich this summer because he is aiming to replicate Frank Lampard’s impact at Stamford Bridge. The 21-year-old moved from Bayer Leverkusen in a £71million deal in September. However, Bayern was keen to keep one of the best young German prospects in the Bundesliga. Havertz admits he was lured by Chelsea’s ambitions and plans to win the Premier League title with a young, attacking side. He told Sport Bild: “It was important to me to have a club with a vision. “An exciting change is taking place. We are a young team with many great players. We think offensively. “We want to build something up here and attack. That motivates me a lot. And then it is a title with Chelsea is worth a lot more.”

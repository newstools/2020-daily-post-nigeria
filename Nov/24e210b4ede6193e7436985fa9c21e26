Private schools proprietors in Kano State have faulted the state government’s directive for 25 per cent reduction in the school fees for the third term of 2020/2021 academic session. DAILY POST had reported that the state government in October had directed private schools proprietors to reduce 25 per cent of the school fees for the third term to cushion the effect of COVID-19 on parents in the state. Reacting, the state Joint Committee of Private and Voluntary Schools Associations in a statement by Mr Basheer Adamu, Chairman, Association of Model Islamic Schools (AMIS) and Alhaji Muhammad Adamu, Chairman, National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAPPS) in Kano on Monday said that the proprietors would not reduce the fees. According to the statement, the proprietors said the decision was taken due to the fact that they did not receive financial support from either the state or federal government during COVID-19 lockdown. However, state’s Commissioner for Education, Mr. Sanusi Kiru, while briefing newsmen on Monday in Kano said that there was no going back on the directive. He said that the government has the power to enforce the directive on the private school owners but chose to negotiate with them on the matter. “Although over 80 per cent of the private schools proprietors have complied, I want to inform you that we have 99 actions that can be taken against recalcitrant proprietors who refuse to obey the directive. “We have set up an endorsement committee to go round private schools to ensure compliance. We want to be fair to all, but some are trying to be stubborn. “When you investigate, you will find out that even the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) has cancelled the third term session, we also have the right to do the same,” he said.

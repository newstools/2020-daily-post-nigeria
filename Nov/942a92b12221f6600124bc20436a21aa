Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has said that by defecting to the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State has clearly shown that he is not a thorough bred politician. “Let him, however, be told on time that APC will mess him up soon. He will heavily be disappointed because they will frustrate him,” Bamgbose, a 2023 presidential hopeful, said in a chat with DAILY POST on Thursday. The New Nigerian Peoples Party, NNPP, chieftain said that it was politically naive of Umahi to believe that APC will give him their 2023 presidential ticket. Following weeks of speculations, Governor Umahi finally dumped the main opposition party on Tuesday citing a number of injustices by the party leadership. “Let him be told that, he cannot realize his presidential ambition in APC. His defection has exposed him to be a politician devoid of political foresight. “APC will never zone the 2023 presidency to the South East. It’s the last thing that the party will do. David Umahi has behaved like a political toddler. “His defection is highly defective. He should be crowned as a joker of the year 2020, if he believes that he will be handed over APC Presidential ticket, it’s very doubtful. “There is however another possibility that he was cajoled by APC to come over to APC for him to be running mate to a Northerner. This is a great deception. “It’s really a big surprise that after winning via PDP, he could now ditch them because of his unrealisable ambition. It’s really pathetic and very unfortunate,” Bamgbose said.

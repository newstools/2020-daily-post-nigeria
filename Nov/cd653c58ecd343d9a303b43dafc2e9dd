Nabena said Buni and his team have been meeting with all leaders, groups and interests in order to accommodate all interests. The spokesman cited the vote of confidence recently passed on them by Non-National Working Committee) and the previous one by 36 State and FCT Chairmen. Nabena noted that the CECPC reviewed the implementation of its three months action plan last Tuesday. He said registration, update, revalidation of the party’s nationwide membership register is ongoing. “APC NEC directed all aggrieved party members who had gone to court to withdraw cases. The CECPC further directed affected parties to fully comply with the directive in the true spirit of peace and reconciliation. “The CECPC has substantially reconciled various factions in some affected states, viz: Bauchi, Bayelsa, Cross River, Edo, Ekiti, Enugu, Zamfara, Ondo, Oyo States”, the statement read.

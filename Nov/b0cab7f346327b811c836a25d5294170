The head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, could be out of the job after the return leg against Sierra Leone on Tuesday. Rohr has come under fierce criticism since the team threw away a four-goal lead to draw 4-4 with the Leone Stars on Friday. Following the shock result, the Minister of Youth and Sports, Sunday Dare, had a meeting with the president of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick and the players. Dare also demanded a technical report which will provide a detailed review of the Eagles’ collapse at the Samuel Ogbemudia Stadium in Benin, Edo state. However, a decision would have to wait until Nigeria face Sierra Leone in Freetown. When asked if Rohr could be fired, a source close to the Minister chose to remain coy. “[I have] no clue,” he simply said. Rohr only signed a two-year extension to continue in the role in May 2020.

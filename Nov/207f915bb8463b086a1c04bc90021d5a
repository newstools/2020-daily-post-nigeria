The Federal government on Wednesday opposed the bill to regulate the ecological fund. The government argued that such a bill will limit the power of the President over the use of ecological funds for interventions. Government’s opposition to the bill was delivered by the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha who was represented by Clinton Igwe, the Director, Pollution Control, OSGF at the public hearing on the bill organized by the House committee on ecology. The government in its memoranda argued that the regulation “will replace the interventionist posture of the Ecological Fund Office as presently constituted. Adding that “This will by implication slow down the quick response in dealing with erosion problems in Nigeria.” The government noted that it will interfere with the mandates of other Federal Government Establishments such as National Emergency Management Agency, National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency and National Environmental Standards and Regulation Enforcement Agency as duplication of function. Earlier, the Speaker in his opening remarks said the bill is part of the legislative agenda of the 9th House. In his speech, he appealed to those at the session to keep an open mind. “The Legislative Agenda of the 9th House of Representatives commits us to seek and implement legislative solutions to the problem of ecological damage in our country. “I ask you also to engage the legislation with an open mind – speak freely, listen to the contributions of others,” he said.

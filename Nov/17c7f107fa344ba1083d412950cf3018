A former Manchester City defender, Joleon Lescott, has said that Chelsea is among the favourite contenders to win the English Premier League title this season. Chelsea are currently in the third position on the Premier League table after ten games behind Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool. Asked if he thinks Chelsea are title challengers, Lescott was quoted by Sport Review as saying: “Yes, I think they are. “Again, they are another surprise. I did not think Frank Lampard would be able to harmonise his squad so early. “I was sceptical. I thought if the owner is spending that amount of money, they have to be contenders. They are not spending that money to finish in the top four, they’ve to be contenders. “I thought the longer they were not, the more pressure he [Lampard] was going to be under. “I was scared because I did not want someone else to benefit from him [Lampard] recruiting those players. “Because what obviously Chelsea recognise that people outside may not is that most of those players will love Frank Lampard because he was their idol.” Chelsea will return to Champions League action on Wednesday night against Sevilla after playing a 1-1 draw with Tottenham over the weekend.

Gov. Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, on Friday gave contractors handling the rehabilitation of federal roads in the state up until Nov. 28 to return to site or the state government would take over the projects. The Governor issued the ultimatum during an interactive session with newsmen at the Government House, Umuahia. According to him, the measure was to ensure the timely completion of the projects. He also revealed that his administration would no longer fold its arms and watch the people suffer untold hardship as a result of the complete dilapidation of the roads. Ikpeazu listed the roads to include Aba-Port Harcourt Expressway (awarded during the administration of former President, Goodluck Jonathan), Aba-Ikot Ekpene Road and Umuahia Ikot Ekpene Road, awarded in 2018 and 2013 respectively. Others are the Umuahia-Uzuakoli-Ohafia Road and Ohafia-Bende-Umuahia Road which were both awarded about four years ago. “We are calling on all the contractors handling federal roads in Abia to redouble their efforts. “Many lives and valuable property has been lost due to the deplorable conditions of the roads. “Also, trade and commerce in Aba has suffered a major drawback because traders from other parts of the country can no longer access the state. “They should return to site on or before Nov. 28 otherwise we will be forced to takeover the projects because we cannot continue to watch our people suffer,” he said. He further said that his administration would take over the rehabilitation of the roads, “with or without a refund from the Federal Government”.

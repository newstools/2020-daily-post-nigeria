The Forum of Retired Department of State Services Directors (FORD) visited the Director-General, Yusuf Magaji Bichi, on Friday. The delegation was led by the duo of J. O. Obuseh, and Peter Egure. Peter Afunanya, DSS Public Relations Officer, gave details of the meeting in a statement on Friday. The forum advised Bichi not to be distracted “by mischief makers whose stock in trade is to undermine the integrity of the service”. The former officers pledged their loyalty and support to the him and Nigeria. In his remarks, Bichi said he will continue to ensure that threats and crimes against the internal security are contained. “I am here today to serve. I will remain professional in the discharge of my responsibility and ensure that everyone is treated without bias. “We are aware of the challenges ahead but only a unity of purpose will help us overcome them. It is only if and when we collaborate that we can move the Service and the nation forward.” The DG urged all retired and serving personnel to be dedicated and play their part to ensure the DSS attain greater heights.

Former Chelsea star, Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, has urged the club to sign two players in January to help manager, Frank Lampard, win the Premier League title this season. Hasselbaink wants Chelsea to sign a defender, either Leicester City’s Caglar Soyuncu or Inter Milan’s Milan Skriniar and another creative midfielder in the January transfer window. He said this ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash against Newcastle United on Saturday. Chelsea are currently in the fifth position on the Premier League table. “A lot of people are talking about Kalidou Koulibaly, but he is 29 years old and would be very expensive. “I actually quite like the Leicester defender, Caglar Soyuncu. I think he would be very good at Chelsea,” Hasselbaink told Ladbrokes. “Also the defender at Inter Milan, Milan Skriniar – everybody is talking about him, another very good player. “So there are players out there, but it is such a difficult position to fill at the moment. “I would also like to see another creative midfielder. “I do not think Chelsea are far off at all [from winning title].”

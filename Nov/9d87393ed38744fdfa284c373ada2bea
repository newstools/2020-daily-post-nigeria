Let me also add that he has visited Sokoto five times and I have equally visited Ife.” “One of the unique features of the Ooni is the esteem at which he carries Yoruba culture with huge dignity, this means a lot because anyone who throws away his culture is throwing away his life. I remember when I visited Brazil, I saw Yoruba culture being displayed live, that sends a great message.” The Sultan said. Oba Adeyemi, who will be commemorating his 50 years on the throne next January, assured the Ooni of his readiness to keep supporting his good moves towards uniting the Yoruba race and Nigeria in general. Similarly, the Odole Oodua, Sir Kessington Adebutu hailed the Ooni over what he described as the monarch’s strong start, particularly the task of unifying the Yoruba nation worldwide, which he said had earned him great respect across the world. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-856848" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201129-WA0010.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="639" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201129-WA0010.jpg 960w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201129-WA0010-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"> In his reaction, the Ooni thanked all dignitaries present for their love and support over the past five years, adding that he will continue to work with them for the betterment of all. “I am so honoured today with your royal presence and I pray that God Almighty will continue to honour you. “The journey in the last five years has been so wonderful and I give God all the glory and I want to thank all traditional rulers across the country for the love and kindness,” the Ooni noted.

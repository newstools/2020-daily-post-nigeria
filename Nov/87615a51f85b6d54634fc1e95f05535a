The Coalition of Oduduwa Descendants, has applauded the testimony of the Nigerian Army on the Lekki toll gate shooting at the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution. The group said the testimony was an indication that the Army has nothing to hide over it’s involvement in the End SARS crisis in Lekki toll gate. A statement by the group’s Secretary General, Emmanuel Abe said the statement was an indication that the Army has regards for the rule of law. The coalition reiterated the claim that the soldiers at the Lekki toll gate fired blank bullets at the protesters. Abe explained that the blank bullets were fired to scare the hoodlums who hijacked the peaceful protest. The statement reads: “This much was highlighted in the testimony given by representatives of the Nigerian Army that appeared before the panel. We find this disposition commendable, which by and large indicates the tremendous respect the Nigerian Army authorities, has for the rule of law in the country. “The fact that the governor of Lagos state invited the Nigerian Army to intervene in the Lekki Toll Gate protest is an indication that things were going out of control and the last resort was to invite the Nigerian Army to restore law and order. “It remains the fact that hoodlums and thugs had hijacked the protest and were on the verge of unleashing violence but for the intervention of soldiers that fired blank bullets into the air in an attempt to dismiss the already restive and volatile crowd.” It has been widespread criticism over the involvement of the Nigerian Army in the End SARS crisis. However, the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army had said contrary to insinuations, soldiers who stormed the Lekki toll gate were invited by the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.

UEFA has sent a request to FIFA President, Gianni Infantino, to adjust the handball law again in order to provide more flexibility for referees and prevent players from being unfairly punished. In the letter, UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin asked for it to be considered during the November meetings of the game’s lawmakers. This comes after a spate of penalties being awarded because balls have hit outstretched or raised arms. “The attempt to strictly define the cases where handling the ball is an offense has resulted in many unfair decisions which have been met with growing frustration and discomfort by the football community,” Ceferin wrote. “The spirit of the game must be preserved at all times,” Ceferin said. “I believe that going back to the previous wording, perhaps reviewed and integrated by a provision which does not allow goals to be scored with a hand/arm, is an option to be taken into account.” UEFA has no influence in the laws of the game despite running the world’s biggest club competition and having the most popular domestic leagues on the continent. The International Football Association Board (IFAB) is instead controlled by FIFA.

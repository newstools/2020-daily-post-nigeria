Former Super Eagles striker, Nwankwo Kanu, has expressed his delight after Arsenal beat Manchester United 1-0 on Sunday. The Gunners returned to winning ways after consecutive defeats against Manchester City and Leicester City. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s 69th minute penalty proved to be the winner, as Arsenal won at Old Trafford for the first time since September 2006. Excited by his former team’s performance, Kanu took to social media to revel in the club’s fourth win of the 2020/2021 campaign. “Done and dusted. Come on you Arsenal, job well done. We move!,” he wrote on Instagram. The result saw Arsenal move up to eighth place in the table on 12 points, ahead of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side who are in 15th place.

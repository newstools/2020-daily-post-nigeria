The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Sunday, said the United States, US, rescue operation has confirmed President Muhammadu Buhari’s incompetence. PDP said the US rescue operation has exposed how Buhari-led Presidency has failed to protect it’s citizens. The opposition party lamented that under Buhari administration, bandits and kidnappers now stroll into the country freely. In a series of tweets, PDP said: “The swift operation by the @WhiteHouse
to rescue her citizen held hostage by bandits on Nigerian soil has further confirmed that the @MBuhari Presidency can neither secure the territorial integrity of our nation nor arrest the wave of insecurity ravaging our country under its inept watch. “The party describes the situation where the @WhiteHouse had to come on our soil to pull a rescue, as an international embarrassment and shows how low the
@MBuhari Presidency had fallen in its failure to guarantee the safety of lives and property in our country. “Moreover, the fact that under President @MBuhari, bandits and abductors from neighboring countries now freely cross into our nation to use our soil as detention camps further shows the failure of his administration to secure our national borders and territorial integrity. “It also shows that contrary to claims by the @MBuhari administration, parts of our country are still under the control of bandits and insurgents. “It is indeed grossly disconcerting that under our Commander-in-Chief, a general, who had consistently promised to lead from the front, it took a foreign country to come on our soil to rescue their citizen, while hordes of our citizens are reportedly being held, tortured and killed in various kidnappers’ and insurgents’ dens in various parts of our nation. “Our party recalls that earlier in April, Nigeria was equally embarrassed by reports of how the Chadian President Idris Deby, personally led his troops to rout out insurgents and freed Nigerian territories and soldiers held captive by terrorists in northern part of Borno.”

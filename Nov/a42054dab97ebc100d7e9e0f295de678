The U.S. General Services Administration, GSA, has finally recognized Democratic Party candidate, Joe Biden as the apparent winner of the November 3 presidential election. The agency made the acknowledgment on Monday, following weeks of inaction. With the development, a formal transition process has begun in earnest giving Biden and his team access to current agency officials, briefing books and other government resources, including some $6 million in funding. This happened after about nine Republican Senators sent a letter calling for the transition process to begin, and hours after Michigan’s Board of State Canvassers had voted to certify the election’s results. Emily Murphy, the GSA chief, said in a letter to Biden on Monday, “Because of recent developments involving legal challenges and certifications of election results, I have determined that you may access the post-election resources and services described in Section 3 of the Act upon request.” Reacting to the announcement, Yohannes Abraham, Executive Director of Biden-Harris transition, said it “is a “needed step” to “getting the pandemic under control and our economy back on track. “In the days ahead, transition officials will begin meeting with federal officials to discuss the pandemic response, have a full accounting of our national security interests, and gain complete understanding of the Trump administration’s efforts to hollow out government agencies.”

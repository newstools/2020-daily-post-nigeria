The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has closed its case against the Deputy Speaker of the Benue State House of Assembly, Christopher Adaji and the Clerk, Torese Agenabefore. They were at the Benue State High Court, Makurdi, on Tuesday. Justice S. O. Itodo presided. The duo is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on a two-count charge of abuse of office and criminal misappropriation of public funds to the tune of N5,040,950. Prosecution counsel, George Chia-Yakua, closed the case against the defendants after the testimony of the third prosecution witness (PW3), Gideon Kure. Kure, an EFCC staff, told the court that the agency got incriminating evidence against Adaji and Agenabefore from different organisations. The prosecution tendered 23 exhibits and all were admitted. Clifford Tyover Attle (PW1) and Ifa Celestine Mbakaa (PW2) testified previously. Justice Itodo adjourned the matter to December 9, 2020, for cross-examination of PW3 and for the accused to open their defence.

The Nigerian Army has said that they have not received any formal petition over their alleged shooting of peaceful End SARS protesters at the Lekki toll gate on Oct. 20. The counsel for the Nigerian Army, Mr Akinlolu Kehinde (SAN), made this known on Saturday when they appeared before the Lagos Judicial Panel of Inquiry and Restitution for Victims of SARS Related Abuses ad Other Matters. “I must submit today that there is no allegation whatsoever against the Nigerian Army before this panel. “I urge your lordship to discountenance any proposal that the testimony of the Nigerian Army should not be allowed because of a proposed petition. “Unfortunately, for reasons known to most of us, the Nigerian Army could not give their testimony when they were summoned on the last adjourned date. It is a very respectable organisation. “The Nigerian Army is here again ready to testify, and they have set up their projector and is ready to discharge the summons. “I repeat, as at six minutes to 11am today, no petition has been served against the Nigerian Army, if any petition has been served, we will respond,” he said. —

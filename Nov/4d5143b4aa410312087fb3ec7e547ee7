The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has called for a law placing restriction on public office holders from sending their children to foreign countries to study. The Akure zonal Coordinator of ASUU, Prof. Olufayo Olu-Olu said such ban would put an end the persistent strike in Nigeria’s education sector. Olu-Olu explained that if such a law is promulgated, it would help to rebuild Nigeria’s education sector. A statement by Olu-Olu reads partly: “Members of the ruling class and their cohorts have their wards schooling abroad, so they do not commit to ending ASUU strike since the political office has become occupational rather than public service. “Until we domesticate two very important practices as laws in Nigeria, we may not get out of this doldrums -first, an act to compel all public office holders and government appointees to have their wards educated in Nigeria public schools from primary to tertiary level. “When this law is enacted, perhaps we will gradually see the end of needless ASUU strikes in the country.” ASUU has been on strike for about eight months, following federal government’s failure to meet its demands. Despite a meeting with government representatives last week, ASUU had vowed to continue with the strike until all demands are met. However, there are speculations that ASUU zonal branches would meet by Friday to decide if they would call off or continue the strike.

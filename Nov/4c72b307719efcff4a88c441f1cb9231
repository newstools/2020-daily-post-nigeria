The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA, on Tuesday, accused President Muhammadu Buhari of deceiving and duping Nigerians. HURIWA made the remark in reaction to the ongoing corruption trial of Ibrahim Magu, suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. The rights group claimed that Buhari’s government was “gambling with the sensitivities of Nigerians regarding the issues of alleged corrupt practices levelled against Magu.” A statement by the National Coordinator of the frontline activist group, Emmanuel Onwubiko, said several months after a panel was set up to trial Magu, nothing has been heard. According to Onwubiko: “It is clear that we have all been deceived and duped by the President Muhammadu Buhari- led administration into believing the ferry tales that it plans to fundamentally overhaul the hierarchy of the anti-graft body following the setting up of a judicial panel led by erstwhile President of court of Appeal Justice Ayo salami to probe accusations of corruption against Ibrahim Magu and some of his affiliates known as ‘Magu Boys’. “It is now over several months since the panel was inaugurated and the then acting Chairman of EFCC Ibrahim Magu was suspended, arrested, detained for days and freed. But till date, the Federal government is yet to disclose the outcome of that panel even as the anti – graft body has remained without a substrate and is seemingly rudderless and directionless. “Certainly, this government of Muhammadu Buhari has played on the gullibility of most people to think that it can get away with such monumental deception and lies. “The government by this Orchestrated and choreographed delay in the investigation of EFCC under the suspended acting Chairman Ibrahim Magu has shown a total lack of commitments to battle corruption which has eaten deep into the affairs of Virtually all Federal agencies and ministries, some of which can not even meet up with the statutory obligation of paying staff salaries.”

The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Jigawa says its acting party Chairman Habibu Sara was sacked over his involvement in misappropriation of party funds. DAILY POST reported that Habibu Sara was sacked following a caucus meeting of the party, after the report by a committee set up to investigate allegations against him. Party Secretary Muhammad Umar Dikuma was appointed as acting chairman. The embattled chairman, however, said the suspension was null and void and contrary to the party’s constitution. Speaking to DAILY POST, the acting state APC chairman Alhaji Muhammed Umar Dikuma explained that the State Executive Committee (SEC) has found the former acting chairman Habibu Sara guilty of misappropriating party funds, hence the reason behind his sack. This was coming on the backdrop of an earlier meeting held on Sunday at the state government house with Governor Alhaji Muhammed Badaru Abubakar, the Deputy Governor, Senators, House of Representatives members, party excos and other political appointees. The state acting chairman also said the party had specifically summoned a meeting involving elected and appointed members of the party to discuss ‘specific’ issues affecting the harmony and unity of the party with the sole aim to strengthen relationships amongst party members. He said contrary to reports from some media that elected officials were absent during the meeting is an indication that the party had loomed into another crisis. He noted that those whose faces were not seen, sent representatives or tendered their apologies.

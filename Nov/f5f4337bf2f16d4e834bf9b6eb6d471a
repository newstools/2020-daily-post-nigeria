The Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, has disclosed those who hijacked the peaceful End SARS protest. El-Rufai disclosed that the peaceful protest was hijacked by anti-democratic forces. He, however, noted that organisers of the protest had the best of intentions for the country. The governor stated this while addressing newsmen after a meeting of the Northern Governors Forum and traditional rulers in Kaduna, yesterday. “We believe that the End SARS organisers have the best of intentions, but there are people that are pushing their own evil, anti-democratic agenda. “We have taken very clear positions on some of these issues, and we also back our road map, looking at various aspects of our lives, including Nigeria’s economic challenges, developmental and the almajiri problems,” he said. It’s a known fact that hoodlums had taken over the peaceful End SARS protest to cause havoc on businesses and some government establishments.

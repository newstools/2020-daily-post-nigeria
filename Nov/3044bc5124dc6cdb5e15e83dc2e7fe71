Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said referee Graham Scott should explain his controversial decision to award a goal to Brighton, following their 2-1 win over Brighton on Sunday. Bale’s header proved to be the winner, after Tariq Lamptey cancelled out Harry Kane’s penalty. However, the match was marred by refereeing and VAR controversy. Lamptey scored the equaliser in the second half, despite Solly March fouling Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg in the build-up. VAR operator, Jonathan Moss, alerted Scott to the possible foul and asked the referee to come to the pitch-side monitor to review March’s tackle. However, Scott ruled that Lamptey’s goal should stand, after viewing the incident for 70 seconds. When asked about the decision after the match, Mourinho told Sky Sports: “I prefer to stay away [from VAR]. “Probably the referee should go to the press conference and explain. He had time to go to the screen so only he can explain why it is a goal. He is a good ref and a good guy, only he can explain that decision. My view doesn’t matter.” Lamptey’s goal wasn’t the only controversial moment involving VAR, with Brighton’s Leandro Trossard having a penalty appealed dismissed by Moss after a review.

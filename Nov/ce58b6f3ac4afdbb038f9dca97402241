Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is facing a potential injury crisis in his attack, the UK Mirror reports. Solskjaer could be without Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Mason Greenwood, as the Premier League returns this weekend, and as they host West Brom on Saturday. Martial became the latest of United’s forwards to emerge as a doubt, when he missed a training session with France on Monday due to a back complaint. The 24-year-old did not play in the 4-2 Nations League win over Sweden on Tuesday. Rashford suffered a shoulder injury during the 3-1 win over Everton just before the international break and had to withdraw from England duty. Greenwood did not join up with Gareth Southgate’s squad or the under-21s, after United asked for him to be rested following a series of minor niggles and personal issues recently. There is, however, hope that Martial, Rashford and Greenwood could all be fit to face the Baggies.

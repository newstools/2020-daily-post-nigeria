Nigeria’s 0-0 draw with Sierra Leone on Tuesday evening, means that they failed to win a single football match in 2020. The Super Eagles failed to see off the Leone Stars in two Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers played within four days. Last Friday, the three-time African champions surrendered a four-goal lead to draw 4-4 with John Keister’s men in Benin, Edo state. In the return leg in Freetown, there were no goals between both sides, in what was eventually an underwhelming game. The double-header was initially scheduled to be played in March/April this year, but the Coronavirus pandemic disrupted football calendars. When the sport eventually returned, Nigeria warmed up for the AFCON qualifiers with two friendlies against Tunisia and Algeria. They lost 1-0 to Algeria and drew 1-1 with Tunisia three days later. In total, the Super Eagles played four matches in 2022. They lost one and drew three.

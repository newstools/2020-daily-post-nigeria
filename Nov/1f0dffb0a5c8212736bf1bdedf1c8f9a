Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has given reasons why Sadio Mane is starting from the bench against Brighton in their Premier League clash on Saturday. Klopp made six changes to his squad from the one that lost 2-0 to Atalanta in the Champions League. Takumi Minamino starts alongside Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota. Nathaniel Phillips, Fabinho and Andy Robertson also start for the champions in defence. Mane, 28, has scored four goals and made one assist in eight Premier League appearances this season. When asked about the changes he made to his Liverpool starting XI, Klopp said: “After the medical meeting I knew more and that is why we have the line-up we have. “Nat [Phillips] did really well against West Ham. I don’t like to change the last line constantly but these boys have the opportunity to play these games which is really cool. He will give his absolute everything and I trust him. “We had to find another midfielder and that’s why I decided to bring Taki in.”

Chelsea have gone top of the Premier League for at least five hours, following their 2-0 win at Newcastle on Saturday. Frank Lampardâ€™s men continued their fine form before the international break with a hard fought victory at St James. The Blues were ahead within the first 10 minutes, after Federico Fernandez bundled the ball past his goalkeeper under pressure. Chelsea missed a couple of chances to extend their lead, with Timo Werner especially guilty. However, Werner teed up the ball for Tammy Abraham to secure the points in the 65th minute. It takes them up to 18 points, above Leicester City and Tottenham Hotspur. Spurs can topple their London rivals at the top if they beat Manchester City at home later in the day.

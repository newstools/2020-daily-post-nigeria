President Muhammadu Buhari Saturday extended his condolences to Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State on the passing of Hon. Suleiman Kokori Abdul, Federal Commissioner representing the State in the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC). The President also commiserated with the Chairman and members of the Commission on the demise of the Federal Commissioner, who was sworn in June 2019. Buhari noted that as a home-bred politician and former member representing Okene/Ogori-Magogo constituency in the sixth National Assembly, Kokori understood the place of dedication and compassion in public service; adding that this earned him admiration and respect in politics as well as among his people. A statement signed by his Spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the President recognized the contributions of the late Federal Commissioner to the administration’s drive to mobilise revenue from the non-oil sector and hopes that his dedication to duty will continue to inspire the work of the RMAFC. Buhari said his thoughts are with Abdul’s family during this time of mourning even as he prayed the Almighty Allah to forgive the shortcomings of the deceased and bless him with Al-janah Firdaus.

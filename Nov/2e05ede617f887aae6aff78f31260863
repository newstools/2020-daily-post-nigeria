Real Madrid are ready to ramp up their pursuit of Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappe. However, the LaLiga giants will only make a move, if the France forward does not sign a new contract with PSG. Madrid have been long-term admirers of Mbappe, but have so far played the waiting game. The Ligue 1 champions are ready to throw all of their resources at a new deal for the 21-year-old, in order to convince him to commit his future. But Real Madrid are confident that they can snap him up next summer, according to Spanish outlet AS. The French club would be under much more pressure to sell Mbappe in the summer of 2021 with just one year left on his deal, to avoid losing him for free one year later, if he chooses not to extend. Madrid have reportedly estimated that the fee for Mbappe would be around Â£161million.

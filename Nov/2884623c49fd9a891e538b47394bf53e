President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that the Federal Government alone can’t finance universities in Nigeria. Buhari said the private sector must be involved in financing universities in the country because the burden is too much for the government alone. Speaking at the 2020 convocation and 72nd foundation day celebration of the University of Ibadan on Tuesday, the President said universities should make themselves attractive to the private sector. The President was represented at the occasion by the Executive Secretary, National Universities Commission, NUC, Prof Abubakar Rasheed. He charged universities to come up with programmes that would help his government in reducing poverty and improving the health sector. He said: “It must be noted that the government alone cannot carry the enormous burden of financing education. The private sector must be actively involved in the task of providing quality education for Nigerians. “It is my expectation that universities will make themselves attractive to the private sector, define their roles and carve out a niche by designing programmes that will progressively assist the Government in addressing poverty reduction, improving the health sector.” Buhari also warned heads of governing councils of Nigerian universities against mismanaging the process of appointing vice-chancellors. He noted that the governing councils would be held responsible for the outcome of the process. “Pro-Chancellors, in their dual role as chairpersons of governing councils and chairpersons of the five-person selection committee for the appointment of Vice-Chancellors, must be prepared to bear full responsibility for the management or mismanagement of the process.” Meanwhile, Buhari had promised to meet all the demands of unions in the educational sector in Nigeria.

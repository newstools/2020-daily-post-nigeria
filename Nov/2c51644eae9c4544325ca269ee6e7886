Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has revealed the team suffered three injury setbacks involving Marcus Rashford, Luke Shaw and Victor Lindelof during their 3-1 win at Everton. The Red Devils came from behind to win, thanks to first-half goals from Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford, after Bernard had given the Toffees an early lead. Edinson Cavani netted his first goal for the club in the 95th minute to seal the points. However, it was a mixed bag for Solskjaer ahead of the international week. When asked if there were any injuries at Everton, Solskjaer told MUTV: “Yes. Victor’s back, Marcus’s shoulder, Luke Shaw’s hamstring. That’s three I can remember from the top of my head. “I hope everyone else is okay. David didn’t play [in midweek] but he had a groin problem before the game.” Both Lindelof and Rashford played the full 90 minutes at Goodison Park, but Shaw had to be withdrawn after 67 minutes for Axel Tuanzebe.

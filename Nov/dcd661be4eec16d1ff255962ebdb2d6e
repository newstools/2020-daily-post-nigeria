The Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has said its members are ready to end the seven months strike only when lecturers’ demands are met. Prof Moyo Ajao, Chairperson of ASUU in UNILORIN who spoke at a press briefing on Wednesday said lecturers are ready to return to their duty post but they won’t work on an empty stomach. Represented by the Ibadan Zonal Coordinator of ASUU, Prof. Ade Adejumo, Ajao said lecturers will return to work when the government releases their withheld salaries, remit the check-off dues of the union to the rightful owner. He said: “We are ready to suspend the strike as our children too are tired of staying at home but we cannot work on empty stomachs while politicians’ homes and warehouses are filled with palliative materials that they don’t even need.”

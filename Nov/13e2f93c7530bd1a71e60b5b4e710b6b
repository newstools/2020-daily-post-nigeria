Real Madrid on Monday confirmed Eder Militao has tested positive for COVID-19, ahead of their Champions League tie with Inter Milan. The 22-year-old, who has featured regularly under Zinedine Zidane this season will now undergo a mandatory period of self-isolation. The club, however, said no other positive results were recorded from the latest round of testing. “Real Madrid CF would like to inform that our player, Eder Militao, has tested positive in the COVID-19 tests carried out yesterday, Sunday morning. “All the other players and the technical staff from the first team, as well as all the employees of the club who work directly with them, tested negative in that same test,” the statement read. Militao joined the LaLiga club from Porto for £43 million last year.

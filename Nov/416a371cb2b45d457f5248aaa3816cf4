Former Plateau State Governor, Jonah David Jang, will soon leave the country for medical reasons. His lawyer, Mike Ozekhome (SAN) made the disclosure on Thursday. Ozekhome prayed Justice C. L. Dabup of Plateau State High Court, Jos, to allow Jang travel to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for treatment. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) is prosecuting Jang for alleged criminal breach of trust and misappropriation of state funds to the tune of N6.3billion. Ozekhome assured that his client would be back before the next adjourned date, February 16. Justice Dabup granted the prayer. Jang is a former Senator. He represented Plateau North in the National Assembly from 2015 to 2019. His request for treatment outside Nigeria coincided with his ex-colleagues’ instruction that the State House equip its facility and stop President Muhammadu Buhari from foreign medical trips. The Senate Committee on Federal Character and Intergovernmental Affairs gave the directive on Thursday when the Permanent Secretary, State House, Tijani Umar, appeared to defend his 2021 budget. The official presented a budget of N19.7billion of the financial estimate, N1.3billion was proposed for the State House Clinic. Committee Chairman, Senator Danjuma La’ah told the presidency to ensure that Buhari and other government officials desist from traveling abroad for health issues.

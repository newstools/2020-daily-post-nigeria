The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has confirmed the invitation of Mr. Babatunde Fowler, former Chairman of the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) for questioning. NAN reports that the EFCC spokesman, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, told newsmen on Monday that Fowler was invited by the Commission but responded to the invitation today. Uwujaren, however, did disclose the details of the investigation. President Muhammadu Buhari had replaced Fowler as FIRS chairman in December 2019, at the end of his first term in office. Fowler before his appointment as FIRS boss had served as Chairman of the Lagos State Inland Revenue Service.

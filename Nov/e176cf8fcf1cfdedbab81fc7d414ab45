The ex-wife of 9ice, Toni Payne, has warned fans to stop coming to her social media page accusing her of cheating on her ex-husband, 9ice. Toni Payne said this on her Instagram page after a viral video of the singer cheating on his wife, Sunkanmi with another woman emerged. There were allegations sometime ago that the marriage between Payne and 9ice crashed because she was cheating on 9ice with Ruggedman. However, the ex-wife took to her Instagram page on Saturday insisting that she never cheated while she was married to 9ice and cursed those hurling insults at her. She warned fans to leave her out of the recent drama surrounding 9ice and let her leave her life, adding that she has moved on. Toni Payne said: “One of the most annoying things I have to deal with is some random idiot coming on my page to accuse me of cheating on my ex, something that never happened. I don’t know how many times I have to say this. “It’s been 10 years, move on and stop accusing me of cheating on my ex-husband, 9ice. “I don’t know why people keep coming to my page with this, I’ve moved on please leave me alone. “The fact I have to deal with this 10 years later is annoying but please leave me out of this bullshit because I don’t want any part of this.” This is coming after 9ice publicly apologised to his wife for cheating on her. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-855810" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_4561.jpg" alt="" width="811" height="1447" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_4561.jpg 811w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_4561-168x300.jpg 168w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG_4561-574x1024.jpg 574w" sizes="(max-width: 811px) 100vw, 811px">

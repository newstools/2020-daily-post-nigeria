Super Eagles goalkeepers, Daniel Akpeyi and Maduka Okoye, both conceded three and four goals respectively over the weekend for their respective teams. Akpeyi, who was making his second start of the season for Kaizer Chiefs, conceded three times against Orlando Pirates in the MTN8 semi-final on Saturday. His compatriot, Okoye, also let in four goals on his Eredivisie debut for Sparta Rotterdam who lost 4-1 to Heerenveen on Sunday. Incidentally, this is not the first time Okoye is conceding four goals in a game. The 21-year-old had conceded four goals in Regionalliga division, while in action for Fortuna Dusseldorf II, who lost 4-2 to Borussia Dortmund II in 2019. Both Akpeyi and Okoye have been called up by Gernot Rohr, for next weekâ€™s 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying double-header against Sierra Leone.

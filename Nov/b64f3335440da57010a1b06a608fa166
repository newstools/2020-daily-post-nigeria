Casademont Zaragoza Shooting Guard, Rasheed Sulaimon has been ruled out of D’Tigers’ 2021 FIBA AfroBasket qualifiers on account of injury. Sulaimon was listed in the 20 man list released by Coach Mike Brown. He will no longer play in the November 27 – 29 qualifiers due to a torn muscle in his left abdomen and a leg wound. The player is expected to be out for up to 8 weeks. The 26-year-old, whose team is currently topping Group D after 2 games in the Euro League, expressed his disappointment. “This is so disappointing for me as I would have loved to join up with the team for the qualifiers and play my part. I was looking forward to my debut for Nigeria but that will have to be put off till another time. “Right now, I am staying positive and focusing on recovering from the injury and coming back stronger and better. Athletes will always get injured, but how you react to these setbacks sets you apart”, he told NBBF media. The final training camp will open in Kigali on November 23. Nigeria will face host Rwanda, Mali and Algeria.

Obianuju Catherine Udeh, popularly known as DJ Switch, has described President Muhammadu Buhari government as “a dictatorship with a democratic face”. DJ Switch was responsible for the Instagram Live, that beamed the shooting by the Nigerian Army at the Lekki Toll Gate on October 20, 2020. In an interview with Becky Anderson on CNN on Wednesday, she said, “Nigeria is a dictatorship with a democratic face. I think that it is primarily to please the international community. It is our right to protest for the change that we demand. “This government has used force from the beginning. They started with infiltrating a peaceful protest with things but that did not work. Then they moved to bring the military in.” DJ Switch also asked the Governor of Lagos state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to speak the truth about what happened at the Lekki Toll Gate. “They know the truth and they have conflicting stories with each other. Nigerians have died and this is not a time to play games. Families are looking for their loved ones. The governor owes a responsibility to the citizens of Lagos State to say the truth,” she added. DJ Switch is believed to have fled the country amid threats to her life.

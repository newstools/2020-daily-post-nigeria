The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, on Friday announced that all the pending by-elections across Nigeria would be conducted on Saturday, December 5, 2020. INEC’s National Commission and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Mr Festus Okoye, disclosed this in a statement. Recall that INEC had postponed by-elections slated for October 31, 2020, in six senatorial districts and nine state constituencies. The statement read in part: “The Commission consulted with political parties and Civil Society Organizations on Tuesday and with the media and the Inter-Agency Consultative met with all Resident Electoral Commissioners on Thursday. “Based on these consultations, the Commission believes that security in the affected states has improved while the environmental challenges have reasonably abated, consequently, the Commission has decided to hold all the pending bye-elections on Saturday, December 5, 2020. “We appeal to voters and stakeholders in the states with pending by-elections to continue to cooperate with the Commission in its efforts to deliver credible elections under a safe environment.”

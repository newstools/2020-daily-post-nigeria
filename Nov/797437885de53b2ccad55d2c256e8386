UK Minister of Africa, James Duddridge, has harped on the importance for Lagos judicial panel to investigate incidents reported by End SARS protesters at Lekki Toll Gate. Duddridge, who made this known after a call with Governor of Lagos state, Jide Sanwo-Olu was reacting to the recent End SARS protests across the country. On his Twitter page, Duddridge wrote: “I had my first call with Lagos Governor @jidesanwoolu today. We agreed on the importance of @LagosSarsPanel receiving full authority and cooperation to investigate incidents, including at Lekki plus a greater UK-Lagos cooperation on infrastructure, tech and green finance.” Recall some End SARS protesters were allegedly shot at LEKKI TOLL GATE on the 20th of October, 2020 during a peaceful protest. This led to investigation and setting up of a judicial panel in the state. The Judicial Panel of Inquiry was set up by the Lagos State Government, to probe the Lekki Toll Gate shootings and several complaints of human rights abuses against members of the disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS). Consequently, bank accounts of those who received funds linked to the End SARS campaign have been blocked by the government.

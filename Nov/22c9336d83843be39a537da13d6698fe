The People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Abia State has dismissed the claim of a former governor in the state, Dr Orji Uzor Kalu on social media that the incumbent, Okezie Ikpeazu had planned to defect from PDP to the APC, as a precondition to winning his last electoral mandate at the Supreme Court. In a statement made available to DAILY POST, the state publicity secretary of PDP, Fabian Nwankwo said the electoral matters of the Supreme Court has never been decided based on the defection of a politician from one political party to another. He also described the false allegations as a mere attempt to achieve cheap popularity and distract the public from commending Governor Okezie Ikpeazu on his numerous achievements. Nwankwo also advised APC leaders to prevail on President Mohammadu Buhari to tackle the growing insecurity, Economic retrogression, social injustice and decay of infrastructures in the country rather than making frivolous claims about the dynamic governor. He reaffirmed PDP’s confidence on Ikpeazu to continue leading the party to greater heights, adding that the Governor has never contemplated or has any desire to leave PDP to another party. He also urged Abians and PDP loyalists to ignore rumour peddlers with false information and sustain their support for the Governor to remain focused on delivering dividends of democracy to the people.

The Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has insisted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will win the presidency in 2023. According to him, the ruling party has impressed Nigerians with their development strides since they came into power. “APC has come to stay. We are developing the country, the people are happy with our programmes, we are touching lives and we are securing the nation,” Bello said on Thursday’s edition of Channels Television’s Politics Today. “Why won’t they (Nigerians) give us a chance once again to produce the president of this country? “APC by the grace of God will produce the next president and sweep the legislative houses and the governorship across the country,” he said. Bello also mocked the chances of the main opposition, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The Governor claimed the PDP is “gone” and that was why politicians are leaving the party. “Even though power belongs to God and God gives power to who He wills, I can assure you that PDP is gone and is going and going,” Bello added. APC seized power from PDP during the 2015 general elections, when President Muhammadu Buhari defeated the then incumbent Goodluck Jonathan.

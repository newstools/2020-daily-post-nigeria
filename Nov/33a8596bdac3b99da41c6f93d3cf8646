Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has labelled Nicolas Pepe’s conduct “unacceptable”, after he was sent off in their 0-0 draw with Leeds United on Sunday. Pepe was handed just his second start in the Premier League but failed to take his chance. The Ivory Coast international headbutted Ezgjan Alioski, leaving referee Antony Taylor no chance but to show him a red card following a VAR review. Speaking after the game, Arteta said: “Considering how early we got Pepe sent off we have to take it. I never like a draw but in the circumstances, it’s a point. It is unacceptable. “The first half there were two different periods. The game broke a bit, we started to give the ball away and led to them having the space to break. The second half it was a matter of defending well and staying patient and using the pace of our players in the space they were leaving.”

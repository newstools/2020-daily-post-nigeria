The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Kaduna State, has said that the news of the demise of Alhaji Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa, the former Governor of Kaduna State, marks the end of the era of a selfless individual. A statement signed by CAN Chairman, Rev John Joseph Hayab said, CAN will not forget in a hurry the selfless brand of leadership that Alhaji Balarabe Musa brought to Kaduna State in 1979. According to the statement, “He led the state with an open mind, giving numerous opportunities to those who had no chance of going to school, paving ways for the sons and daughters of nobody to become somebody without exploiting them or pitching them against their people.” The statement recalled that, late Balarabe Musa government then, built many schools that children of the less privileged can attend. “Besides, late Balarabe Musa established industries to boost the economy thereby opening employment opportunities to citizens. “Certainly, he was a father, grandfather and supporter of all. Kaduna State has lost a leader, fighter and defender of the people, both in and out of office,” the statement added. CAN stressed that late Alhaji Balarabe Musa fought for the people both in and out of office. “While former leaders act as if all was well, he will come out for the sake of the people to condemn bad governance. When former leaders turn away their faces from the pains and sufferings of the masses, Alhaji Balarabe Musa would stick his neck for the masses,” it noted. The statement further explained that peace-loving people of Kaduna State and Nigerians across the regions will miss Alhaji Balarabe Musa. “He was indeed a hero from his days’ government to the last minute as a grandfather. May God comfort us all,” the statement emphasized. “CAN therefore, prayed to God to comfort his immediate family, the state and the nation and raise leaders who will care for the people without bias,” the statement added

A former England striker, Michael Owen, has predicted that Manchester United will secure a win against West Bromwich on Saturday night when both teams clash in the Premier League fixture. Owen also predicted that Chelsea will beat Newcastle United on Saturday afternoon and Manchester City will defeat Tottenham Hotspur. “West Brom come into this after a string of poor results,” Owen was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “For all United are inconsistent, they are up against a side that are really struggling, and I expect them to win this comfortably.” Speaking on the Newcastle vs Chelsea game, Owen said: “Newcastle appear very inconsistent just now. “I originally said I fancied Chelsea to finish third. However, I think that the points total will be lower this year, and that could bring the Blues right into the title mix. “If they’re to achieve that, then they’ll have to take maximum points from matches such as this. With Timo Werner in such good form, I think he could be amongst the goals in a Chelsea victory.” On the Tottenham vs Man City match, Owen said, “I think this will be a tight game and a difficult one to call. “However, if Man City can find their best form, I think they’ll be taking all three points back to Manchester.” The kick-off time for Man United vs West Brom is 9 pm, while that of Newcastle vs Chelsea is 1:30 pm and Tottenham vs Man City is 6:30 pm.

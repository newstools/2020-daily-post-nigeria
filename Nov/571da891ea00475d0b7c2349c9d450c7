No fewer than five persons have been killed in the last two days as a result of a suspected cult-related clash between members of Eiye and Aye confraternities. It was gathered that some of the active participants were among those who recently escaped from the Benin and Oko prisons as they continued their war of supremacy. The clashes have mostly happened in Upper Sokponba, Ogida and New Benin areas of Benin City. Reports had it that some gunmen took over Siluko Road near Ogida barracks brandishing guns and forced all those trekking to raise up their hands while several motorists turned back. Also two people were reportedly killed in Idogbo on Wednesday, one close to a filling station after the Ikpoba-Okha local government area secretariat, and another near Y-Junction also along the same Sokponba Road. Another two including one said to be a father of four and the other said to be an escapee from one of the prisons were also killed near Ogida barracks. One person was earlier killed on Wednesday near the Constain area in New Benin. Some residents in Upper Sokponba Road told DAILYPOST; “We have been living in fear in this area and other parts of the state capital. By 5 to 6 pm, people run into their houses because these boys openly brandish their weapons robbing and harassing people. Just yesterday alone, two people were killed which we later learnt belong to rival cult groups”. But when contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer, Chidi Nwabuzor simply told DAILY POST reporter to call back so that he can inform him on what the office is doing concerning the issue. “Call back, I will tell you what we are doing, thank you,” he said.

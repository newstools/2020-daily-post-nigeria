The Federal Government says plans are underway to reopen Kano and Port Harcourt International Airports. Musa Nuhu, Director-General of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), spoke at a briefing of the Presidential Taskforce (PTF) on COVID-19 in Abuja on Thursday. He disclosed that there were two issues delaying resumption of activities â€“ ICT infrastructure and adequate number of staff. The DG said it was necessary to decongest the Lagos and Abuja airports to make travels more convenient for passengers. Nuhu did not give a specific date for the reopening. International flights from Abuja and Lagos airports resumed on September 5.

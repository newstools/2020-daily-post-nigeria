President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday has asked youths to do well to keep the peace in Nigeria as it is in their ultimate interest. Buhari spoke at the State House in Abuja, while receiving in audience the Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations, UN, Amina Mohammed. Commenting on the recent End SARS protests and destruction of public and private properties that followed, Buhari said: “Our own generation is on the last lap, we are exiting.” A statement by his spokesman, Femi Adesina quoted Buhari as saying: “It is in the interest of the youths to keep the peace. They want jobs, infrastructure and development. I have sent a team led by the Chief of Staff (Professor Ibrahim Gambari) to go round the country, talk to traditional rulers, who will then talk to the youths. The views of the youths have been heard.” He said that the current administration inherited severe infrastructural deficits, “and that is what we are fighting to correct. We can’t just sit, fold our hands, and do nothing. We are doing our best within the limits of resources.” Buhari regretted the fact that COVID-19 had shrunk the global economy, noting that “this is something you can’t see, smell, or hear,” but which has wrought devastation on lives and livelihoods around the world. On climate change, Buhari said Nigeria was concerned about the recharge of the Lake Chad, which has great implications on security, irregular migration, and livelihoods.

The Governor of Zamfara State, Hon. Bello Mohammed Matawalle has vowed that there is no going back on the order he has placed on the emirs and Local Government chairmen in the State. According to him, most powerful politicians in the state have confronted him to soft-pedal on the issue. “How can I soft-pedal when my people are dying gradually due to the dastard acts of the notorious armed bandits and kidnappers? “The issue of security in the state cannot be negotiated, no matter how powerful the individual may be. And I’m ready to sacrifice my life for that cause. If my blood can bring peace and justice to the people of Zamfara state, I am perfectly okay,” he said. According to a recent press statement signed and made available to newsmen in Gusau, the state capital by the governor’s media and public enlightenment Adviser, Comrade Zailani Bappa, the governor swore to take drastic actions against any offender. He said the law is no respecter of anybody, no matter the political or social status. He called on the people of the State to always remain calm, saying that the State is presently facing a trial period which he assured would be overcome. “As I have promised, we are not here to make money but to salvage Zamfara state because everyone in the state knows very well that there was no democracy in the last administration in the state and that is not unconnected to the reason the former governors want to betray my administration,” he lamented.

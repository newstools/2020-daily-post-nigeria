Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, has called for the regulation of social media in Nigeria. The former lawmaker said this while condemning the End SARS protests that went awry. He stated his position on Thursday when he received the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu. Uzodinma regretted the death of police officers during the nationwide riots. “I am strongly advocating that social media should be regulated in Nigeria. Opposition party incited hoodlums to cause trouble in Imo,” he said. The governor stated that the “real protesters” went off the street after he addressed them. The Imo helmsman preached peace and assured that Imo government would support security agencies.

A Magistrate court in Port Harcourt has remanded a father, Chinedu Anthony in the Nigerian Correctional Centre, Port Harcourt for alleged attempt to murder his five-year-old son. The Court also remanded Anthony’s partner, Chiwendu Nwokoike, under whose watch the five-year-old boy was domestically abused. Anthony and his partner were arraigned for the attempted murder of little Goodluck Chinedu who they locked up in a cage at the back of their home for more than a week in Port Harcourt. Both of them were arrested after their neighbours alerted a lawyer who contacted the Federation of International Women Lawyers (FIDA) to rescue the boy. Magistrate Nnenna Ezeobuzuor who declined jurisdiction to entertain the matter advised that the case file be transferred to the DPP for legal advice. Speaking to journalists after the court sitting, FIDA Vice Chairperson in Rivers State, Nnenna Igbokwe said, “The victim was locked-up in a cage for more than a week to the extent that neighbours were throwing food to him through the cage. We are against the ordeal the little boy passed through. “Parent and guardians must respect the dignity of their children to avoid such ill-mannered treatment”.

The Sierra Leone Football Association president, Ishay Johansen, has said that the Leone Stars will allow Nigeria’s Super Eagles to score just one goal, before going ahead to win the second leg of their Group L 2021 AFCON qualifier tie in Freetown on Tuesday. Sierra Leone made a shock comeback by cancelling a 4-0 deficit to draw 4-4 against Gernot Rohr’s men in the reverse fixture in Benin City on Friday. Speaking ahead of Tuesday’s clash, Johansen insisted that the Super Eagles will be given a goal just for making the trip to Freetown. “I have told the president of the Nigeria Football Federation, my brother and colleague, Pinnick. We would squeeze in one goal for them,” Johansen told Legit TV. “We’ll let them have one, and then we would go with the rest (goals) we would be flying with the rest. “We would probably, you know just for the trip for their effort to make the trip, we would give them one.”

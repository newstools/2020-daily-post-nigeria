The Commissioner of Police in Lagos State, Hakeem Odumosu, has reiterated the command’s readiness to curtail lawlessness by okada riders and motorists. The CP vowed that the Force will not relent in the full enforcement of the Lagos State Transport Sector Law (2018). Odumosu spoke on Thursday at his office in Ikeja while reviewing the ongoing traffic operations with the management team of the command. He emphasized on the need to clampdown on traffic violators for causing road crashes and gridlock. The police boss warned okada operators and other road users to respect the law. Odumosu warned that attacks on police officers and other security agents will not be tolerated. “Any act of lawlessness and crimes will be resisted by security operatives within the ambit of the law”, he said. The command has arrested seven suspects in connection with the attacks on Lagos State Task Force and Anti-One Way teams. They will be charged to court soon.

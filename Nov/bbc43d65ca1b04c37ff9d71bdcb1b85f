The All Progressives Congress (APC) has given a hint on why its governors visited former President Goodluck Jonathan. APC said being a platform for progressives, it was taking steps “to consolidate on its national appeal and acceptance”. Yekini Nabena, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday while mocking the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Earlier, the PDP had noted that leaders of its rival met Jonathan because they realised and have admitted he did well in office. Taunting the opposition as “rattled and disoriented”, Nabena said the state executives’ trip to the former Bayelsa State Governor was not a big deal. “At a time when the PDP and its leadership is grappling with a crisis of confidence, one would expect the failed opposition to focus on picking itself up”, he said. Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni led the delegation to Jonathan. On his entourage were Governors Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Badaru Abubakar (Jigawa), David Umahi (Ebonyi), among others. The Ebonyi helmsman dumped the PDP for the APC last week. The stalwarts met Jonathan one day after a parley with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, Abuja.

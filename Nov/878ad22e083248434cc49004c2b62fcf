Arsenal are ready to sell Nicolas Pepe, after he failed to impress at the Emirates, the Daily Star reports. The 25-year-old put in a fine display against Molde in the Europa League on Thursday, making amends for his sending off against Leeds last weekend. But Pepe is still to deliver on the promise he showed while playing for Lille. The Gunners have admitted internally that they paid over the odds for the Ivorian, having agreed to a £22million up front deal and a further £50m in add-ons in August 2019. Arsenal are now ready to allow the winger to leave if a decent offer comes in. However, they are looking to avoid a situation similar to Mesut Ozil’s. So manager Mikel Arteta has been advised to handle the situation delicately, to maintain the player’s market value.

Manchester City can secure a place in the knockout stages of the 2020/2021 UEFA Champions League with two games to spare if they attain victory over Olympiacos. The Sky Blue side has been in a swift mood owing to their 100% (per cent) record at this stage including their 3-0 successes over Olympiacos in the first leg three weeks ago. Guardiola and his troops lost 2-0 to Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League as their slow start to the League continued. Here, DAILY POST predicts how the Citizens could line-up against Greek Champion. Possible: Benjamin Mendy (muscle), Nathan Ake (hamstring), Fernandinho (stomach), Manchester City may be in complete control of his group, but the Spanish tactician would want to affirm his place in the last 16 of the UEFA Champions League soonest. He is not expected to make a lot of changes, but Raheem Sterling could come in after featuring in the second half of that defeat against Tottenham Hotspur. Star forward Sergio “Kun” Aguero was on the substitute bench for 90 minutes at the weekend. But he could return with the fact that he needs game time to regain his match sharpness. Ferran Torres may be given a rest, though if he gets to play he would aim to be the third Manchester City player to score in his first four Champions League games. Since Nathan Ake is not fully fit, with Fernandinho still on the comeback mission, Aymeric Laporte and Reuben Dias should keep their spot at the back for the Citizens. Here is a possible line up: Ederson; Kyle Walker, Ruben Dias, Aymeric Laporte, Joao Cancelo; Rodri, Kevin De Bruyne, Ikay Gundogan; Raheem Sterling, Sergio Aguero, Phil Foden.

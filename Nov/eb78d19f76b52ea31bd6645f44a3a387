The United Kingdom Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) says the entry of Ebonyi Governor, David Umahi proves that Igbos have identified with the party. Umahi dumped the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) last week on the grounds of “marginalization”. A statement on Monday by Jacob Ogunseye, APC-UK Publicity Secretary, said that development confirms the relevance of APC in the South East. The spokesman called Umahi’s decision bold, strategic and purposeful. “As things stand today, APC remains the strongest party in the country and will continue to win elections in free and fair contests. The defection of Umahi is a demonstration of the dominance and acceptance of the party in the South East and the country at large,” he said. Ogunseye added that by joining the progressives, the governor has set an envious record for himself. He advised Umahi to discard opinions from adversaries and see such as normal in Nigerian politics. The Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) has urged the House of Assembly to impeach him.

Nine students of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Kaduna State who were kidnapped last week Sunday by gunmen have been released by their abductors and reunited with their families. A source who does not want his name in print said, the kidnapped students had their freedom secured after the payment of ransom by their relatives. The students, of the Department of French, were travelling for a programme at the Nigerian French Language Village in Badagry, Lagos State when they were kidnapped along the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway. Also, the Director of Public Affairs, ABU, Auwalu Umar, confirmed the release of the students and reunion with their families on Sunday. Umar said their abductors released them late on Saturday. He, however, did not confirm if any ransom was paid to secure their release. They were abducted at the Akilubu-Gidan Busa axis of the Abuja-Kaduna Expressway. Their abductors blocked the two lanes of the road and opened fire on their vehicle, forcing it to a halt.

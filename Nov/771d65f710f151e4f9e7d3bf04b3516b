Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has insisted he does not feel disrespected by his players. After the Gunners’ 1-0 win at Manchester United on Sunday, former Red Devils captain Roy Keane criticized captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for calling Arteta by his first name in his post-match interview with Sky Sports. Keane said: “He didn’t show him respect when he called him by his name, Mikel. “He’s the manager, the boss, the gaffer. That’s respect. Not Mikel, he’s not his mate.” When asked about those comments during his press conference ahead of Thursday’s Europa League game against Molde, Arteta insisted he was not offended. “I was told that Roy mentioned that, but I don’t think it particularly. I give the players the choice, some call me boss or coach, it depends,” said the Arsenal manager. “I shared a dressing room with some of them so there has been that change, but I don’t feel any disrespect. Although, I understand Roy and why he was saying that,” Arteta said.

The presidency has apologized for the botched South-South parley that top federal government officials were scheduled to attend. Governors and stakeholders left the venue in Rivers State after waiting for hours. The leaders later demanded an apology. In a statement on Wednesday, presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu said “an emergency meeting” summoned by the President caused the delay. He said the Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari, ministers and heads of security and intelligence agencies were in full readiness to proceed to Port-Harcourt. Garba disclosed that they had to stay back after Buhari’s directive. He noted that the information and regret for the inconvenience were conveyed to the hosts “through what we believed were the right channels”. “As may have been gleaned from the statement read by the Minister of Police Affairs, Muhammad Maigari Dingyadi, the extraordinary National Security Council meeting, under the President, was called in view of the gravity of the security situation affecting all parts of the country, including the South-South in the aftermath of the END SARS protests, and the need to rise to protect our national security and territorial integrity.’ Garba assured that Buhari is strongly and resolutely committed to hearing from leaders, stakeholders and the youth on burning issues affecting Nigeria. The aide added that a new date for the South-South meeting will be agreed after due consultations with parties concerned.

A video of Apostle Johnson Suleman’s prophecy concerning the presidential election in the United States has surfaced on social media. In the viral video, the popular clergyman prophesied the defeat of the incumbent Donald Trump. He said that the US will have its first female Vice President and that Americans will massively support Trump’s opponent, Joe Biden. Moreover, Suleman said that Joe Biden will emerge as US President but would be impeached for his Vice, Kamala Harris to take over. In the video recorded in March 2020, the cleric said Biden would be made mockery of and Harris will be President.

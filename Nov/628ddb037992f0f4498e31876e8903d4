Students of the Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED) have demanded justice for Pelumi Onifade. The students protested at the Lagos State Court of Arbitration, Lekki, venue of the Judicial Panel of Inquiry on SARS abuses. Pelumi died in the custody of the Lagos State Task Force. The deceased was reportedly hit by bullet from policemen deployed to a charged scene. Abdulazeez Soneye, TASUED Students’ Union President, said that Onifade was last seen with officers of the Task Force on October 24. “He worked with Gboah TV. He went to cover an incident at the Ministry of Agriculture, Abattoir, Agege, Lagos. He was found dead under mysterious circumstances a few days after his arrest,” he said. Soneye added that due to the ASUU strike, Pelumi worked with the online media outfit. The student leader decried that Pelumi was taken away despite his ID and a reflector jacket which showed he was a pressman. The protesters demanded that the Task Force head, CSP Saheed Egbeyemi, and the Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, give account of what happened. Egbeyemi told NAN that Pelumi’s case has been handed over to the police for investigation.

President Donald Trump has insisted that he is gunning for another history as Americans cast their votes on Tuesday. Trump wrapped up his campaign at a frenetic pace with crowded rallies in four states on Monday. He also said repeatedly that the polls risk being rigged against him. Addressing the crowd in the early hours of Tuesday in Grand Rapids, Michigan, the same place the President concluded his epic against-the-odds campaign in 2016, the 74-year-old Republican candidate counted on pulling off another upset. “We’re going to have another beautiful victory tomorrow,” he told the Michigan crowd, which chanted back: “We love you, we love you!” “We’re going to make history once again,” he said.

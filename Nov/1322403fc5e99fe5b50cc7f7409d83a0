Femi Fani-Kayode, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has predicted what is going to happen in the country’s political space in the next few weeks. According to the politician and former Minister of Aviation, the political landscape of Nigeria will witness many changes. “There are going to be many changes in the political landscape of this country in the next few weeks. Many realignments and new alliances will take place,” Fani Kayode tweeted. “Many will be shocked by what will happen. Those that have laboured will be rewarded. Those that have courage will thrive. Game on!” Furthermore, the former Minister said “One of the biggest mistakes we make as humans is that we think we know God’s mind. We do not. He can use ANY vessel, ANY political party, ANY individual, ANY circumstance, ANY situation that He chooses to achieve His purpose. Only He sees the heart of men. “Sometimes the one we call an angel may be a demon and the one we call a demon may be an angel. Only God knows! We MUST be careful and be guided before judging others. “I have heard things in the last few days which have punctured my beliefs and perceptions about certain groups and people and shattered my notions. I say again: we must be GUIDED. “We must be careful. We must not assume anything and we must be guided by the cold facts and not blinded by emotions or misplaced loyalties. Politics is an art. It is a mystery and an enigma. It is profound, and deep.”

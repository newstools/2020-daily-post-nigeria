Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher has described Manchester United midfielders Pogba Pogba and Bruno Fernandes as the most undisciplined players in the Premier League. Fernandes is currently one of Manchester United’s most important players, with Ole Gunner Solskjaer deploying him at the creative hub of United’s midfield. Carragher said putting Pogba alongside Fernandes would make the Red Devils far too undisciplined defensively. “Fernandes and Pogba are not disciplined,” Carragher told talkSPORT. “They are probably two of the most undisciplined players in the Premier League. “You can maybe carry one but you can’t play the two of them. It’s one or the other. “I do not believe Pogba and Fernandes can play in the same team so you have to play Fernandes and he has played really well since he joined.”

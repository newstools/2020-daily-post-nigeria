Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB has claimed that the Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi never supported or accepted Peter Obi as Vice President to Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in 2019, “because that would have truncated his own chances in 2023.” Umahi, Chairman of the South East Governors Forum, recently decamped to the All Progressives Congress, APC from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Kanu alleged that Umahi rather chose to work for APC presidency, “against his own brother, not minding that both of them are in the same PDP. ” “No Igbo man will get the nod to fly the flag of either of the main political party come 2023.” According to him, Umahi, Governor Nyesom Wike and others are merely storing up trouble for themselves and their children by allegedly conniving with the army and police in the killing of their people. President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday commended the defection of Governor Umahi to the APC. The Nigerian leader described it “as a bold move driven purely by principle rather than opportunistic motives”.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has claimed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is plotting to disown President Muhammadu Buhari ahead of the 2023 elections. The PDP made this allegation in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, on Saturday. According to him, the ruling party had begun campaigns for the 2023 general election one year into Buhari’s tenure. PDP also claimed APC might change their name before the next poll. “The PDP asserts that there are underground moves by APC leaders to disown the Buhari administration, given its failures; the conversation about possible change of their party’s name as well as the plot to destabilize the PDP, are signs of desperation to hold on to power despite APC’s failures and explicit rejection by Nigerians. “Our party and indeed discerning Nigerians have seen through the rambling of the APC, which is merely raising dusts to foul the political firmament in a bid to cover for its lack of internal cohesion, failure in governance and reneging on the promises they made to Nigerians in other to have access to power,” the statement read in part.

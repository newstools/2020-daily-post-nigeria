A team of police officers in France are in trouble for assaulting a black musical producer in Paris. The prosecutor’s office has charged them of intentional violence, Le Parisien newspaper reports. Michel Zecler, on November 21, was walking in the 17th district of Parise without a mask against health protocol. Zecler saw a police car and went into his studio to avoid a fine but the officers followed and beat him. Two of the four law enforcement personnel are in custody, others are under judicial control. One was charged with “intentional damage to health” for throwing tear gas into the producer’s studio. President Emmanuel Macron has called the incident a “disgrace for France”. The incident triggered a nationwide mass demonstration against the new legislation. In recent months, citizens of many countries have demanded an end to police brutality. Nigeria witnessed nearly two weeks of End SARS protest, a youth-led agitation that attracted global attention. The protest went awry from the night of October 20, as rioters caused large-scale destruction of private and public assets.

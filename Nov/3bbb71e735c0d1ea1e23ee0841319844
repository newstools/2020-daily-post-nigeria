Former US President, George W. Bush has congratulated President-elect Joe Biden on his victory in the keenly contested election after polling over 270 electoral college votes. The former President in a statement on Sunday said that, while President Donal Trump has the right to pursue legal challenges and recounts, the 2020 race was “fundamentally fair” and “its outcome is clear”, CNN reports.
According to him, though there has been political differences, Joe Biden is known to be a good man, who has won his opportunity to lead and unify Americans. “I offer him the same thing I offered Presidents Trump and Obama: my prayers for his success, and my pledge to help in any way I can,” he said. Bush also offered congratulations in the statement to Trump “on a hard-fought campaign,” nodding to his “extraordinary political achievement” of winning the votes of more than 70 million Americans, the second-most in history behind Biden. “They have spoken, and their voices will continue to be heard through elected Republicans at every level of government,” the former President added.

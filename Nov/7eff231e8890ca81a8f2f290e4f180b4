Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has ruled out any possibility of striker Olivier Giroud leaving Stamford Bridge amid reports that the France star has asked for a move away from the club in January. Lampard said that Giroud was a very important member of his squad this season, adding that he wants the 34-year-old to stay at Chelsea. The Blues boss said this on Monday during his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s Champions League clash against Rennes on Tuesday. “Oli is a very important member of our squad. He played a lot of games last year, he will always want to play more, and he is a huge member of the squad for me. I know he will be important for us going forward, so I want Oli to be here and to stay,” Lampard said. “I have a very good relationship with Oli, and if ever he felt it was going to go a different way, I would happily have that conversation with him. But I want him to stay here. “There is competition in the forward areas at Chelsea. Everyone has to take that one. I saw Oli’s agent’s quotes, and I thought nothing of them. Oli and I have very open conversations. He wants to play. When he doesn’t play, he is an incredible support for the other players. He trains brilliantly, no matter what. We will cross that January bridge when it comes, but my thought has to be the strength of our squad.”

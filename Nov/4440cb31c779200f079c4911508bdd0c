As reactions continue to trail the killing of rice farmers in Zabarmari in Jere Local Government Area of Borno State, the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has condemned the killing on Saturday by terrorists. Lawan decries the incident as another act of barbarism against innocent Nigerians minding their own business. The Senate President condoles with the families of the victims, Government and people of Borno State over the senseless carnage. “This incident is heart-rending and again demonstrates why we must all continue to support the security forces to thwart the criminals in their evil determination to impose a reign of terror on the North East of Nigeria. “I commiserate with the families of the deceased, Governor Babagana Zulum and the entire people of Borno State and assure them of the sympathy and solidarity of the National Assembly. “This heinous crime is particularly sad given the ongoing spirited efforts by the Federal Government at ensuring food security in Nigeria through the many programmes that have been put in place to support the agriculture sector. “I urge the security agencies to redouble their efforts with a view to bringing an end to mindless violent crimes in our country,” Lawan said. The Senate President said the National Assembly will continue to support the Executive in strengthening the security agencies towards improving the security of lives and property of Nigerians everywhere in the country.

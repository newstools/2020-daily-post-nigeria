Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has declared that the All Progressive Congress (APC) has failed Nigerians. He spoke on Thursday while receiving APC defectors to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The event was held at the PDP state secretariat. Wike said most APC members have remained in the party due to shame of openly admitting failure. The decampees include ex-Director of Finance, Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Henry Ogiri of Abua/Odual LGA; Lolo ibieneye of Asari Toru LGA; ex-APC Zonal Administrative Officer, Gloria Boma of Degema LGA, and Hassan Douglas of Okrika LGA. Wike told PDP loyalists not to discriminate against the returning members. “Let us see ourselves as one not divide ourselves as people that came back yesterday”, the governor appealed. Noting that the PDP was working to develop Rivers, Wike said the APC has been unable to fulfil its promises. “Some people came to say if you give us your votes the East-West road would be done but it hasn’t been done,” he added. He expressed dissatisfaction with the federal government’s alleged refusal to contribute counterpart funding for the Bonny-Bodo like other federal projects. “Since they started the Bonny-Bodo road, they haven’t finished it and haven’t released their counterpart funding. LNG has decided to build the road on their own and deduct the cost from their tax”, Wike disclosed.

President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday urged Nigerian youths to shun street protests and engage his government in meaningful discussions on police reforms. Buhari said Nigerian youths should engage his administration in discussions that would bring about comprehensive reforms to end all forms of police brutality against. He spoke in his message to the maiden National Youth Day celebration, observed on November 1, which coincided with the African Youth Day celebration. Represented by the FCT Minister, Muhammad Bello, Buhari assured that his administration has heard the pleas of Nigerian youths. A statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu quoted the President as the Federal Government ‘‘now wants to hear concrete and practical ideas. ”You must realize that protests cannot last indefinitely. My government will not lift a hand to stop or suppress you. ”However, the fact of the matter is that other forces and actors will seek to take over your protests that they may redirect them in ways you did not intend and perhaps do not agree with. ”Every successful protest movement the world over has understood that there comes a time when activity must move from the street to the negotiation table. That time for you has come. Do not be afraid of this reality. You should welcome it.”

The All Progressives Congress, APC, on Wednesday reacted to the presidential campaign posters of Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation. APC’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena said both Amaechi and El-Rufai have not informed the party about their intentions to contest for presidency in 2023. The campaign posters also had Nasir El-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State as Amaechi’s running mate. Messages on the posters read: “The People’s choice,” “Today may not be the best, but tomorrow will be better”. The posters were sighted in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and some highways in Abuja. However, Nabena in a brief chat with DAILY POST said the party needs to find out those behind the campaign posters. According to Nabena: “We need to find out if they are the ones behind it or people are the ones doing it. “We need to get those things clear because they have never told the party that they want to run for presidency, so I really don’t know. Until they inform the party, then I will know.”

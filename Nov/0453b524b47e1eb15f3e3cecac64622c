Gunmen suspected to be kidnappers have reportedly abducted eight passengers of a commercial bus between Okhuessan and Emu in Esan South East Local Government Area of Edo State. DAILY POST gathered that the bandits also reportedly robbed all the occupants of the Toyota Hiace bus and dispossessed them of their valuables on Tuesday.

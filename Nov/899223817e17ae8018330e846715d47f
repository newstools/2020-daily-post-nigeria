Nigerian rapper, Folarin Falana also known as Falz has slammed President Muhammadu Buhari over his congratulatory message to Joe Biden, the projected winner of the US Presidential election. Buhari in his congratulatory message had said, “Respect for the will of the people is the very reason why democracy remains the best form of government, despite its limitations from one polity to another, and from one society to another.” But Falz queried Buhari’s motive on the statement, demanding to know who wrote the congratulatory message. He claimed that the President knows nothing about respecting the will of the people. In a tweet on his handle, Falz asked, Who typed this? Because you clearly know nothing about respecting the will of the people.” Falz, Runtown and other celebrities had led the peaceful End SARS protest on its first day in Lagos State.

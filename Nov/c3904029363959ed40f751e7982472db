Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has reacted to the exit of Mahmood Yakubu as Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Yakubu on Monday handed over to Ahmed Mu’azu, a national commissioner. He will assume office in an acting capacity. Five other national commissioners also bowed out. There retired Air Vice Marshal is in charge of INEC electoral logistics committee. Mu’azu will be in the position pending the confirmation of Yakubu or otherwise. IPAC, in a statement, said the “timely and well organised peaceful temporary transfer of power” was a sign that Yakubu is a democrat. The body urged the Senate to reconvene and endorse the former electoral chief “so that the ongoing electoral reforms can be driven to a logical conclusion”. “This step is important in order to enable the commission’s chairman to quickly settle down for the daunting tasks ahead, starting from the conduct of bye-elections in some constituencies across the country”, it added.

The Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, has told parents and students that there’s no hope in sight to call off the ongoing strike. ASUU had embarked on strike shortly before the Coronavirus lockdown, demanding the fulfilment of its 1999 agreement with the Federal Government. The union said it will not end the strike until its demands on the Federal Government’s table are fully met, asking students and their parents to stop hoping that schools will resume soon The Zonal Coordinator of the Abuja zone of ASUU, Prof. Theophilus Lagi, made this known in a press conference at the University of Abuja campus, on Tuesday. ASUU accused President Muhammadu Buhari led government of not showing commitment in resolving the issues. “[Our] members are relentlessly determined to continue with the ongoing strike until our demands are met,” the Coordinator said. “Today, we wish to let Nigerians especially our students and parents know that there is no hope in sight to ending or suspending the ASUU strike that has lingered for several months as Government is yet to show serious commitment towards addressing our core demands”

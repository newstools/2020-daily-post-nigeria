Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said he has “no explanation” for their inconsistent form, after they lost 2-1 at home to Alaves on Saturday. The defeat makes it three games without a win in LaLiga. Lucas Perez scored an early penalty, before Joselu doubled Alaves’ advantage in the second half. Casemiro grabbed a late consolation goal for Los Blancos. Zidane’s team were beaten 4-1 at Valencia and drew 1-1 at Villarreal earlier this month, but appeared to have bounced back after a 2-0 victory in the Champions League at Inter Milan in midweek. “We played a bad game, above all at the start, and we couldn’t change it,” Zidane said. “I’m the coach and I take the blame, as always. We have to move on from this. We have another game on Tuesday. We played really well against Inter, and today we didn’t. There are no excuses. We shouldn’t single out one player or another. “We couldn’t change the dynamic within the game and that annoys me. Right now, consistency is the problem we have. We’ve had a lot of injuries too. We don’t look for excuses, but it’s the reality. The game we played three days ago in Milan, and then today. I don’t have an explanation.” Real’s next two LaLiga games are an away trip to top-four contenders Sevilla and a derby with Diego Simeone’s in-form Atletico Madrid.

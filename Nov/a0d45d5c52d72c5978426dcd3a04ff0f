Arsenal winger, Nicolas Pepe, has apologised to his team-mates and fans after “letting them down”, following his red card against Leeds on Sunday. Pepe was sent off after headbutting Ezgjan Alioski in the 51st minute. The Ivorian’s dismissal meant the Gunners had to dig in for a draw at Elland Road. Manager Mikel Arteta criticised Pepe’s “unacceptable” actions after the match. Pepe has now taken to his Instagram page to apologise to his team-mates and supporters for letting the team down. “Yesterday, I let my team down at a crucial time of the game and there are no excuses for my behaviour. “I am deeply sorry and would like to apologise to the fans, my team-mates, my coach and everyone at the club,” he wrote. Pepe will now miss games against Burnley, Wolves and Tottenham.

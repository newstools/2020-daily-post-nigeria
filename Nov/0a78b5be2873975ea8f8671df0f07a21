President Donald Trump’s legal team has distanced themselves from conservative lawyer, Sidney Powell. Powell, a lawyer recently recommended by Trump himself, may no longer be part of the team after she made multiple incorrect statements about the election voting process. Powell had extended her conspiracy theories and vowed to “blow up” Georgia with a “biblical” lawsuit. In a tweet last week, Trump had said that Powell was part of a team of “wonderful lawyers and representatives” spearheaded by Giuliani. But a statement by Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, Trump’s frontline lawyers, said on Sunday that, “Sidney Powell is practising law on her own. She is not a member of the Trump legal team. She is also not a lawyer for the president in his personal capacity.” The statement may indicate trouble in Trump’s legal camp as they have lost multiple cases in efforts to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the November 3 presidential election.

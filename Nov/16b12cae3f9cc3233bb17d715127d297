Former CNN presenter, Piers Morgan, has predicted that Democratic Party candidate for this year’s election, Joe Biden, will win Pennsylvania later today. According to Morgan, this will ensure he becomes the next president of the US. “PREDICTION: Joe Biden’s going to win Pennsylvania later today, and become President of the United States,” he tweeted. Biden has already expressed his confidence in winning the election. In an address to the nation, he said although “democracy is messy”, he has no doubt he would be declared winner once all the votes were counted. Votes are still being counted in key swing states including Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina and Alaska.

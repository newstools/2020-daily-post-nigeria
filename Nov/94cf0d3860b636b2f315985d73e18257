The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said that the strength of the party in Ebonyi and South-East was intact inspite of Gov. Dave Umahi’s defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). National Chairman of the party, Mr Uche Secondus, said this in his remark at the 90th National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting of the PDP held at its national headquarters, Wadata Plaza, on Thursday in Abuja. Secondus said that the PDP refused to be blackmailed on reasons given by Umahi for his defection to the APC. “You must have read the eventual defection of Umahi to the ruling APC on Tuesday and his provocative reason of allegation of injustice against the South East by the party. “We have refused to join issues with him in any way, but we cannot bow to any blackmail. “What I can report to NEC is that the strength of our party in Ebonyi State and South-East is intact and the NWC has taken necessary steps to protect and guard it. “The real season that informed this decision will soon be exposed,” the national chairman said. DAILY POST recalls that Umahi had on Tuesday announced his defection to the APC at a news conference in Abakaliki, ending months of speculations. The governor said his defection was to protest against the injustice meted to the southeast by the PDP, the party he had supported since Nigeria’s return to democracy in 1999.

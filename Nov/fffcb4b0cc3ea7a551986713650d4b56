Ibrahim Gambari, Chief of Staff to President Muhammadu Buhari was in Lagos on Sunday. He was at the Bourdillon residence of former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu. Tinubu, a former Senator, is the national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). On his entourage were the Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, and some South-West Ministers. They include Babajide Fashola, Minister of Works and Housing; Lai Mohammed, Minister of information; Minister of State for Health, Olorunimbe Mamora, and Sunday Dare, Minister of Youths and Sports. Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu was also present at the meeting. Tinubu posted a group photo of the officials Sunday night. The visit was to “symphatise” over the recent destruction in Lagos, a message on his Twitter handle read. Tinubu’s assets – Television Continental (TVC) and The Nation Newspaper – were set ablaze by hoodlums. The Jagaban, as fondly called, accused the opposition of masterminding the attacks.

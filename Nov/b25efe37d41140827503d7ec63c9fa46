The agitation by Okada riders against the seizure of their motorcycles by the Lagos State Task Force is lingering. The uproar comes three weeks after Lagos witnessed large-scale turmoil after the End SARS protest went awry. The demonstration started on Tuesday at the Second Rainbow area on Apapa-Oshodi expressway. The operators set fire to objects as they accused authorities of high-handedness. Hoodlums joined them to attack Task Force officials. DAILY POST had reported that the protest was spreading to other locations in Nigeria’s commercial city. The chaos has now entered the second day. There is civil disorder at Ikeja along. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-855210" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201118_113756.jpg" alt="" width="525" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201118_113756.jpg 525w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201118_113756-146x300.jpg 146w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201118_113756-498x1024.jpg 498w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px"> Fears that it may extend has caused panic in the state government, security agencies and among residents. The police are scrambling to put the situation under control. It is not yet clear if the military would be called in but human and vehicular movement have been halted. Adebayo Taofiq, Head of the Task Force Public Affairs Unit, had explained that they received several complaints about Okada operators using their bikes to rob. He said the unrest started after operatives went out for enforcement. “They damaged beyond repair 2 of our vehicles with one of our trucks. A paramilitary officer attached to the agency (Ganiyu Mustspha) was wounded with broken bottles and cutlass because he mistakenly ran into the mob.” The spokesman complained that since the End SARS protest, motorists including Okada riders operate with impunity and cause traffic gridlock.

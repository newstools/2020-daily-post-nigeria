The Commander of the 81 Division of the Nigerian Army, Brig. Gen. Ahmed Taiwo, has disclosed the roles played by Lt.- Col. S.O. Bello and Brig.-Gen. F.O. Omata during the shooting at the Lekki Toll Gate in Lagos State. Following the End SARS protest, soldiers had reportedly shot and killed soldiers at Lekki toll gate on October 20, 2020. However, Taiwo said Bello who was the Commander on ground had given the order for the soldiers to shoot in the air, NAN reports. Taiwo who is a military witness disclosed this during cross-examined at the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry for Restitution, on Saturday in Lagos State. He stated that Bello was the Commanding Officer of the 65 Battalion which was at the Lekki tollgate on the fateful day and Omata was also present at the scene with him. “When I called Bello he said that while they were being deployed, they were attacked by hoodlums and they released some shots into the air. “Bello had arrived the scene first before Omata, as the whole 81 Division Garrison had been given the mandate to secure the whole Eti-Osa corridor. “Omata had left Obalende to meet up with Bello and patrol the whole area,” he said.

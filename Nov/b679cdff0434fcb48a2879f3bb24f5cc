Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, on Sunday, urged US President Donald Trump to stand firm to the very end. Fani-Kayode said this while reacting to Trump’s claims that Joe Biden, candidate of the Democratic Party, won the November 3 US presidential election because the poll was rigged. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Trump alleged that Biden won the November 3 election through mass fraud “He won because the Election was Rigged,” Trump tweeted. “NO VOTE WATCHERS OR OBSERVERS allowed, vote tabulated by a Radical Left privately owned company.” However, reacting to the development, Fani-Kayode expressed confidence that Trump will prevail, insisting that millions all over the world are with him. He tweeted: “Stand firm to the very end. We shall prevail. God said so and so it shall be. You are not alone Mr. President: millions all over the world are with you. “We are all proud and strong Trumpians and we are also sons and daughters of the Living God. He will never let us be ashamed!” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-854792 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FANI.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="469" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FANI.jpg 600w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FANI-300x235.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px">

The Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) of the Federal Medical Centre, Idi-Aba, Ogun State, on Tuesday announced that its doctors were embarking on a warning strike over assault of a doctor on duty. Dr Adekunle Jimoh, the president of the association, disclosed this to newsmen on Tuesday at the hospital in Abeokuta, NAN reports. Jimoh, who complained of the frequent assault on health workers by patients said it was becoming a menace in the health sector. He said health workers were targeted, beaten and lynched outside the hospital, adding that the assault is now being experienced in the hospital. “We, the doctors say this is unacceptable and we are not going to tolerate such acts any longer. “A member of ours was assaulted yesterday around 6.30 p.m by a patient’s relative in the cause of the doctor trying to take care of a patient. “In the cause of that, we have decided to down tool for at least 24 hours, which started today to press home our demand. “We should have said we should go on indefinite strike but we also want to put other patients who are not involved into consideration,” he said. He, however, noted that they were not going on strike on the usual request of doctors asking for more money but to end the menace of violence against health workers, saying it is unacceptable.

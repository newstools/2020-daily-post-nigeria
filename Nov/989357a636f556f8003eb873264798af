The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Ayodele, has revealed how he prophesied the defeat of outgoing President of the United States, US, Donald Trump. Primate Ayodele disclosed that he had in 2019 foretold Trump’s defeat to a strong candidate. The clergyman recalled saying the Republican would lose if they allowed Trump to be their presidential candidate in 2020. Recall that Joe Biden of the Democratic Party had defeated Trump after polling most of the votes during the just concluded presidential election. Trump, however, faulted the results, saying he won the “election by a lot.” However, Primate Ayodele, in a statement sent to DAILY POST recalled that: “Trump’s second term is uncertain. There will be an attempt to impeach Trump but I see him surviving the plot. I see a serious candidate from the Democrat unseating him in the 2020 election. “It has come to pass; the prophecy started coming to pass with the impeachment threat which Donald Trump survived and now, his loss to Democrat party candidate, Joe Biden in the 2020 USA election.”

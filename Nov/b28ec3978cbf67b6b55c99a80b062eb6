The ongoing industrial action by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU, may be called off, following the union’s meeting with the federal government. At the meeting held on Friday, the federal government agreed to increase its offer to the union to N70 billion. The Federal government’s team was led by the Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige while ASUU’s delegation was led by its National President, Prof. Biodun Ogunyemi. Federal government promised to pay university lecturers N40 billion as the Earned Allowance and N30bn for the revitalization of the university system. The government also agreed to settle the arrears of salaries of the lecturers before December 4, 2020. Addressing newsmen on the outcome of the meeting, Ngige described the negotiation as fruitful. Ngige disclosed that the government made a proposal to ASUU which it would take back to its members. He said: “Many issues were discussed at the meeting including salary shortfall, the payment system and revitalization of the university system. I am positive that all the issues would be resolved at our next meeting.” ASUU has been on strike for about eight months over government’s failure to meet its demands.

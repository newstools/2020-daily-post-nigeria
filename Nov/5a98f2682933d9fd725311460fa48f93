Ghanaian actor, John Dumelo, has explained his reasons for contesting for a seat at the country’s’ parliament. Dumelo is running as a Parliamentary candidate for the National Democratic Congress (NDC) in the Ayawaso West Wuogon Constituency of Ghana. The actor says his Parliamentary bid is a calling from the people to make lives better in and out of his society. He says his people beckoned on him to avail himself to be voted as their representative and Member of Parliament(MP). Dumelo says though he doesn’t have to be in the Parliament to make an impact on the people but needs the position to be able to influence policy frameworks that will make life better for his constituency. “My Parliamentary bid is a calling. The people called on me to represent them and I heeded to their call.” I chose to go to Parliament so that we can make laws because that will help me represent my people better,” Dumelo said on Accra-based Peace FM.

Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle of Zamfara State has condoled the family of the leader of the Peoples Redemption Party, PRP, late Alhaji Balarabe Musa, just as he described him as an astute, honest and progressive politician. Governor Matawalle, who said he received the news of the passing away of the elder statesman as a great shock, also added that the country has yet lost another gem whose interest did not derail from national unity and cohesion. This was contained in a statement signed and made available to newsmen in Gusau, Zamfara State capital by the Special Adviser on Media and Public Enlightenment to the state governor, Hon. Zailani Bappa. “Late Balarabe Musa was a father to us, an elder statesman, a nationalist, an honest leader and a progressive politician per excellence”, Governor Matawalle said. “The nation has lost a brave, courageous and fearless leader who is not afraid of saying the truth at any given time. Our country today needs people like late Barabe Musa to be on track. We shall surely miss him in these trying moments of our journey as a nation”, Matawalle observed. “On behalf of myself, my family, the entire government and good people of Zamfara State, I extend my heartfelt condolence over the demise of this exemplary man,” Governor Matawalle further condoled. On his party, a former Governor of Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Mimiko, has described the death of ex-Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Balarabe Musa, as a big loss to the Nigerian nation and the African continent. Mimiko, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Media, John Paul Akinduro, said “Balarabe Musa was a detribalised Nigerian who until his death remained a true advocate for a just, fair and pro-people Nigeria”. He further described the elder statesman as a dogged politician. “To my mind, his most remarkable legacy was his unwavering commitment to principle in the face of overwhelming opposition and oppression during the ignoble effort to impeach him from the office of governor”

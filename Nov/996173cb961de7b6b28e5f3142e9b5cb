Senior pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, says nothing has changed in Nigeria since president Muhammadu Buhari’s inauguration on May 29, 2015. Giwa specifically urged Nigerians to hold president Buhari and the All Progressives Congress responsible for causing austerity in the country. A statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST on Monday, the cleric said,” I don’t know why President Buhari is fooling Nigerians with recession. Has the country ever been freed from recession since 2015? “Nothing has changed in Nigeria since May 29, 2015. There is hunger in Nigeria, the young ones are jobless. Injustice, oppression and intimidation pervade the country. “They should not fool us with recession because they brought austerity to Nigeria in 2015, and the country is still battling with it.”

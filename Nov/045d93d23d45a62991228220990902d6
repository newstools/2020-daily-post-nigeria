Ibrahim Magu, suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has been summoned by the Code of Conduct Bureau, CCB. CCB asked Magu to appear before it on Tuesday with documents of his assets and copies of his assets declarations while in service, among other things. The invitation was contained in a letter dated November 2, 2020 and was signed by CCB’s Director of Intelligence, Investigation, and Monitoring, SP Gwimi. In the letter, the bureau disclosed that it’s investigating an alleged breach of code of conduct by Magu. According to the letter: “The Bureau is investigating a case of alleged breach of Code of Conduct for Public Officers against Mr. Ibrahim Mustapha Magu, the former Acting Chairman, Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). “In view of the foregoing, you are invited for an interview scheduled as follows: Date: Tuesday 17 November, 2020.

The probe followed an indictment by the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. Malami had accused Magu of misappropriation and insubordination while in office. Prior to the commencement of the probe, President Muhammadu Buhari had approved Magu’s suspension. Magu has, however, lamented over the conduct of the panel which he claimed was against him.

The Commander of 81 Military Intelligence Brigade, Victoria Island, Lagos, Brig. Gen. Ahmed Taiwo has said the Nigerian Army is not happy that the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu denied inviting its men to Lekki tollgate where End SARS protesters were gathered on October 20, 2020. Taiwo said this on Saturday while testifying before the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry probing the Lekki incident. The General, however, said inviting the military was the best decision Sanwo-Olu could have made. However, he said Sanwo-Olu was forced to deny it, because of “the way everything went”. “I spoke with the governor and said the Army was unhappy that he said he did not ask for the Army’s intervention. “But I am sure that after you watched everything (video footage), you saw he had more than enough grounds to ask for the Army’s intervention; perhaps it was the way everything went,” Taiwo said. Sanwo-Olu had claimed that forces beyond his control were responsible for the Lekki shooting but the Army Headquarters fired back in a statement insisting that the Lagos State government invited the soldiers to the protest ground and that the soldiers acted within the rules of engagement.

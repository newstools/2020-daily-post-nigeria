The Nigerian-born medical doctor, Onyema Ogbuagu, who helped in the development of COVID-19 vaccine has been hailed by the United States. The US Embassy lauded Ogbuagu for his role in the discovery of the vaccine in America. Recall that US drug manufacturing firm, Pfizer had earlier in the month announced that the vaccine has an efficacy rate of more than 90 percent to kill the virus. The announcement marked a major breakthrough in the fight against Coronavirus. “Nigerians contribute to the world in so many ways. Our hats off to Dr Onyema Ogbuagbu at Yale who helped develop a COVID-19 vaccine!” the US Mission in Nigeria tweeted on its handle on Monday. Governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, had also extolled the contributions of Ogbuagu, who is from Abia. The Governor had described Ogbuagu, “a twin son of Prof Chibuzo Ogbuagu a former Vice-Chancellor of Abia State University, Uturu (ABSU) and a former Secretary to Abia State Government (SSG)” as “one of the leading lights in the newly found globally celebrated Pfizer vaccine against COVID-19”. Doctor Ogbuagu is an Associate Professor of Medicine at Yale University, US, and is one of those leading the research at Pfizer for a COVID-19 vaccine.

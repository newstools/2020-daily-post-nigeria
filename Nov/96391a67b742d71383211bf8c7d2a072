Two school children have died of cholera in Ogun, the state government has said. The Ogun State Commissioner for Health, Tomi Coker, said the ministry had been notified of the demise of two children from the same school and same compound in Abeokuta. Coker said the death of the two children followed an episode of gastroenteritis, which suggests possible water borne disease, known as cholera. “Investigation led by the Ogun State Commissioner for Health along with officials of the Federal Ministry of Health and Abeokuta South Local Government, revealed that the children died of severe cases of vomiting and diarrhea,” she said. The government, in its bid to stop the spread, said it had put in place community sensitisation and advocacy. According to Coker, the Health Ministry had already sent Cholera alert to all health facilities in the state, while engaging in prepositioning of materials for case management in government hospitals. Meanwhile, the Commissioner has called on all Ogun residents to be on the alert for possible diseases that are common during the dry season. The Commissioner listed Yellow Fever, Measles and Cholera as water and food borne diseases that are rampant in the dry season. “During this period, residents should ensure they have a good water source and treatment. “They should practice regular and proper hand washing as well as proper disposal of faeces while they desist from open defecation,” she said.

Justice Okon Abang of the Federal High Court in Abuja has ordered security agencies to arrest Faisal Maina. Faisal is the son of Abdulrasheed Maina, former chairman, Pension Reform Task Team (PRTT). Maina senior is on the run, a development that resulted in the detention of his surety, Senator Ali Ndume in Kuje Custodial Centre. On Tuesday, the judge also summoned Faisal’s surety, Umar Dangaladima, the lawmaker for Kaura-Namoda Federal Constituency, The House of Representatives member is expected to appear on Wednesday to explain why he should not be remanded in custody or made to forfeit his N60 million bail bond to the Federal Government. Citing section 352 (4) of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015, Abang directed the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to prosecute Maina’s son in absentia just like his father. The orders followed an application by EFCC counsel, Abubakar Mohammed. The prosecution drew the attention of the court to the absence of both the defendant and his lawyers. Mohammed recalled that Faisal has since June 24 failed to appear in court and urged the judge to revoke his bail. He further prayed for a warrant for the arrest of the Defendant, pursuant to section 184 of the ACJA, 2015. EFCC said Maina’s son, between 2013 and 2019, received a total of N58.11 million, being proceeds of corrupt practices by his father. Faisal is also being prosecuted for alleged possession of an illegal firearm. He was accused of pulling a gun against Department of State Services (DSS) operatives who arrested him and his father at a hotel in Abuja on September 30, 2019.

A group, the Act for Positive Transformation Initiative has accused the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, of refusing to pay scholarship funds of foreign students. Kolawole Johnson, the group’s Head, Directorate of Research, Strategy and Programme alleged that the Commission was yet to do the needful. The group was reacting to claims by NDDC that its Acting Director of Projects, Dr Cairo Ojougboh had visited London in September for verification of students on its scholarship scheme. Johnson, who described NDDC’s report on verification as “very untrue,” alleged that Cairo was in London for medical treatment and not for verification of students. According to Johnson: “We strongly condemn the unnecessary drama surrounding the payment of NDDC scholars in foreign countries while officials of the Commission have become so notorious in the predatory act of plundering the resources of the people. “We also hope the Ag EDP has not deceived the Commission to sponsor his personal trip in disguise.” Johnson described NDDC’s refusal to release funds for foreign scholars as “sheer wickedness, gross irresponsibility and incompetence cum corruption.” “This is the same management that paid itself scholarship fund without any scholarship award. “Cairo went to London for medical attention on his ailing eyes, he never stopped by any school for verification exercise. We may release further details, if the Commission attempts to deny this in its usual practice,” he said. The group also lambasted President Muhammadu Buhari for allowing such level of corruption under his administration. It charged Buhari to prevail on the Commission and save students on scholarship. “The government of President Muhammadu Buhari should be condemned for allowing the vicious skullduggery and brazen corruption ongoing in the Commission while genuine claim as the scholars’ demand is daily ignored. “The President must act now to save the scholars, the region and the commission,” the statement added.

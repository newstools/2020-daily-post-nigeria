The Peoples Democratic Party in Zamfara State has flagged off election campaign ahead of the Bakura bye-election slated for Thursday, 5th of December 2020. Speaking at the campaign ground in Bakura town, Bakura Local Government Area of the state, the Deputy Governor, Barrister Mahdi Aliyu Gusau said he was impressed with the way the crowd came out to grace the campaign. “I did not believe that the PDP in Bakura Local Government Area of the state would pull so much crowd considering the political boasting of APC in the state,” he said. “Even though the APC claims that Zamfara is the home base of the APC, the mindset of the people is very clear” He appealed to Bakura people to support the PDP in the forthcoming bye-election in Bakura Local Government Area of the state, saying that most of the APC members have been decamping to PDP, showing the weakness of the party in the state. The Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, Tukur Umar Danfulani commended the people of Bakura Local Government Area for honouring their invitation. The Sole Administrator of Bakura Local Government Area, Abubakar Makau assured that people of the area would vote massively for PDP. He said the grassroots mobilization is still ongoing to ensure that PDP emerges victorious in next week’s bye-election at the Local Government Area. “We want to assure the PDP leaders in the state that we have been working round the clock to ensure victory in the state.

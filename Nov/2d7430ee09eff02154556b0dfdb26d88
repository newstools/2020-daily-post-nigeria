The West Africa Examination Council (WAEC) on Sunday informed candidates that the exam body no longer entertains requests for amendment of date of birth on certificates. WAEC gave the update while responding to @Moyoninuoluwa1 who wanted to correct his date of birth on his certificate. The Twitter user asked, “I’m applying for corrections of date of birth on my certificate which I got the requirements from Yaba office, I was told to apply in Kogi, when I got to Kogi office they told me it’s not possible and I need it asap. Pls help.” And in response, WAEC wrote, “Please, be informed that WAEC in the five member countries no longer entertain requests for amendment of date of birth on certificates.” Meanwhile, WAEC had last week announced the postponement of the 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination for private candidates in Nigeria to November 30, 2020. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-854763" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WAEC.jpg.webp" alt="" width="593" height="356" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WAEC.jpg.webp 593w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WAEC-300x180.jpg.webp 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WAEC-590x354.jpg.webp 590w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WAEC-400x240.jpg.webp 400w" sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px">

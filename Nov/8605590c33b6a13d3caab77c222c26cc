President Donald Trump has blocked government officials from cooperating with President-elect Joe Biden’s team in preparation for a transition, CNN reports. This is after the US Attorney General, William Barr yesterday authorised the Justice Department to investigate Trump’s allegations of election fraud during the November 3 election Bob Bauer, Biden’s campaign lawyer, who lamented the development said the Attorney General’s decision to authorize investigations “will only fuel the ‘specious, speculative, fanciful or far-fetched claims’ he professes to guard against.” Trump also has the backing of some key members of his political party including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who rallied efforts to fight the election results. There are doubts on whether the US would witness the same kind of smooth transition of power that has long anchored its democracy. The Electoral College is expected to take a final decision on Biden’s victory on December 14 However, Trump government is yet to invite the President-elect to the White House as is the tradition. It has been a time-honoured tradition that represents a peaceful transition in the US for sitting presidents and Vice Presidents and their successors to meet CNN reports that there are no plans for Trump to invite the President-elect to the White House in the coming days. This means Joe Biden cannot access additional funds for his transition team, and he has not been cleared to receive intelligence briefings, both touchstones of the formal transition process.

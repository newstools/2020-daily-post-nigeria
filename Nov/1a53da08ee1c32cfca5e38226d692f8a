The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that 18.3% of COVID-19 deaths in Africa are people living with diabetes. WHO said global studies have found that diabetes increases the risk of severe illness and death among patients infected with coronavirus. The WHO analysis of 14 African countries confirmed that the risk of complications or death from coronavirus among people with diabetes increases with age as persons aged 60 and above have greater risks. WHO stressed that the African Region has experienced a six-fold increase, from 4 million cases in 1980 to 25 million. “Far too many people are in the dark as to whether they have diabetes. People with this chronic condition suffer a double blow if they are also infected with coronavirus,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa said.

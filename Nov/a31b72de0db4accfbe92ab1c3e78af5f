The Presidency has vowed that those responsible for looting and destruction of property during the End SARS nationwide protests must be made to face the law. Appearing on Channels Television, a Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said Nigeria is a country governed by law. Mr. Shehu called on the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and opposition politicians to come out and the nationwide looting which followed the peaceful protests. “This country has only one President and that is President Muhammadu Buhari. President Muhammadu Buhari is responsible for this government. “This country is governed by law. The constitution states clearly under section 33 the rights of citizens to freely protest in a peaceful way. “But where a peaceful protest results in a riot, violence, and looting, then there is law and order functions to be performed by the Nigerian government. Everybody was witness to the massive looting of public and private properties particularly in Lagos, Calabar, Plateau, and Taraba States, as well as some other states even the FCT. “So the laws of this land must be allowed to decide, to rule on the wrongdoings on the part anybody. I’m not particular about any celebrity, or any promoter. “This country has been harmed enormously and the people should be prepared to account for what they did. And I feel that is it to the interest of 200 million Nigerians if some of those politicians who had promoted #EndSARS to the time when it was ceased and taken over by looters to also come out with the same force as they did support to deny, denounce (the lawlessness that set in) but they have been silent. But this country has to be saved from.looters. The interest of the country is above politics and PDP must come out and denounce these things.”

President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated former Vice President Joe Biden. Buhari said his election as the President of the United States was at a time of uncertainty and challenges in world affairs. He noted that the victory is a significant reminder that democracy is the best form of government. In a statement by his spokesman, Garba Shehu, Buhari, said the most powerful group are not the politicians, but voters who can decide the fate of candidates for elective office at the polling booth. “The main benefit of democracy is the freedom of choice and the supremacy of the will of the people. I am thrilled by the fact that you are an experienced politician who had served as Congressman for 40 years and a Vice President for eight years. This is a remarkable track record that gives us hope that you will add value to the presidency and world affairs.” The President said he looks forward to enhanced cooperation between Nigeria and the United States at economic, diplomatic and political levels, including especially on the war against terrorism.

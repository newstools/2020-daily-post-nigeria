The Minister of Aviation, Sen. Hadi Sirika, has received the first of three training aircrafts for the Nigeria College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria. Sirika, who disclosed this on his Twitter handle on Sunday added that there was no better aviation safety than having well trained, proficient aviators. According to him, training will now be more efficient, faster and cheaper. “Our roadmap is yielding good result. We appreciate your support, ” he added. Recall that NCAT was designed to be a training centre for Nigerian and African pilots, aircraft maintenance engineers and navigation aid technicians. It, however, created a flying school, air traffic services and communications school and aeronautical electronics and telecommunications school to meet its objectives.

The Lagos State Police Command has arrested seven suspected members of a secret society, Eiye Confraternity, operating at Agura, Ikorodu area. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, confirmed this in a statement in Lagos on Sunday after the suspects attacked some vigilantes in the area called “Agbekoya.” The suspects: “Abolaji Adebayo, 21; Josiah Offem, 37; Oluwapelumi Oyeyinka, 25; Lamidi Taofeeq, 41; Ahmed Shittu, 48; Rabiu Ganiyu, 25; and Zainab Nurudeen, 20, were caught with machetes, charms and a green bus with Reg No: LAGOS APP 600 XA used for operation,” the PPRO said. The PPRO mentioned that the suspected cultists attacked the vigilantes, inflicting degrees of injury on them just to avenge the arrest of one of their members by the “Agbekoya” group. Adejobi added that the State Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, had instructed that the case be transferred to the State Criminal and Investigation Department (CID), Panti, for proper investigation. “This will send signals to other cultists and men of the underworld that Lagos state will be too hot for them to operate or hibernate,” he added.

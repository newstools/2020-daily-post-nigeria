Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, on Friday provided the latest team news update ahead of his side’s home Premier League clash against West Brom on Saturday night. Solskjaer said Marcus Rashford would be available for the West Brom clash despite missing England duty with a shoulder injury. According to him, Alex Telles is also in good shape to feature against the visitors, while Eric Bailly and Marcos Rojo are back in training after recovering from injury. Solskjaer’s men defeated Everton 3-1 in their last Premier League fixture before the international break. “He’s [Marcus Rashford] worked in the gym and has got treatment. He joined in the session today, and I hope he’ll hold his hand up and say he’s ready. That will be up to him. I think he feels okay,” Solskjaer told Man United’s official website. “Alex Telles travelled [to South America] and wanted to play, but then I think there was a mix-up with the tests – positive/negative and there was loads of talk about if he was going or not, first of all to the first game and then to the second game. He’s come back and has been training for a few days and is looking good.” “Eric [Bailly] and Marcos [Rojo] are back training with us,” Solskjaer added. The kick-off time is 9 pm, Nigerian time.

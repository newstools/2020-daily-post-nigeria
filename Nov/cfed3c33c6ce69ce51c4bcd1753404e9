The Yola Electricity Distribution Company (YEDC) on Tuesday gave reasons for the disruptions of electricity to much of the Adamawa State Capital, Yola. Most communities in Jimeta, the heart of Yola, as well as the university town of Girei, have been without electricity for about a week. It had been a frustrating experience especially as Yola people are used to the regulation of power supply. Explaining the cause of the problem on Tuesday, the Senior Manager Corporate Affairs of the YEDC, Mr Kingsley Nkemneme, said an overloaded truck bridged the company’s 11kv network serving affected communities. In a message to assure residents that the issue was being sorted out, Kingsley said repair of the affected parts of the substation was going on. Speaking against speculation that the damage to electricity supply facility was massive, Kingsley said, “In Jimeta, only Jambutu feeder is having issues and we are working to replace all broken down and faulty breakers.” He further explained that the damaged Jambutu Feeder affects Jambutu Injection Station which supplies electricity to FGGC area, Numan Road, Bachure Demsawo, Nasarawo, Jambutu (all in Jimeta, Yola North LGA), as well as Girei MAUTECH, Bajabure and Viniklang (in Girei LGA). The listed communities have been subjected to what the YEDC image-maker called load shedding, which in effect meant that in the past week, the best the communities have had is three to four hours of power in every 24 hours.

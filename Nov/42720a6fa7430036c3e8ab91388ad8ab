Ogonis have asked the Federal Government to halt the ongoing construction of a prison facility and a cemetery on Ogoni land. Coordinating Committee of the 25th memorial of Ogoni martyrs made the demand in a media briefing held in commemoration of the November 10 Hero’s Day. Gbeneme Kpae, who spoke on behalf of the Committee, said the prison facility is being constructed by the Federal Government to lock up Ogonis who are opposed to the planned resumption of oil exploration in Ogoni land. “We call on the Federal Government to stop the construction of a Federal Government Prison and Cemetery in Ogoni as we have been informed that the prison is to lock up Ogonis who demand justice; and cemetery is for mass graves for Ogonis who oppose resumption of oil drilling in Ogoni. “The Ogonis wish to remind all Nigerians and the international community that we will continue to oppose oil exploration and exploitation in Ogoni until Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists are exonerated, and the clean-up of Ogoniland is completed as recommended by the United Nations. “Twenty-five years after the execution of our hero’s, the Ogoni people want to breathe fresh air now. What Ogoni people want is justice, fairness and equity”, Kpae said. Another member of the Committee, Celestine Akpobari insisted that the Federal Government must address the Ogoni matter like they did with June 12. Ken Saro-Wiwa, John Kpuinen, Barinem Kiobel, Felix Nuate, Saturday Dobee, Nordu Eawo, Pail Levura, Daniel Gbokoo and Baribor Bera were all murdered following a military decree on November 10, 1993.

Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has said that his team defeated Newcastle United 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday afternoon because his players dominated possession and scored goals against the host. Two goals from Federico Fernandez (OG) and Tammy Abraham ensured the Blues defeated Newcastle at St. James’ Park. “Today, we dominated possession, and we scored our goals and kept a clean sheet. Very happy with that,” Lampard told a post-match press conference after the game. “We had to make sure the second one came, and when it did we saw the game out very well,” he added. The win over Newcastle means Chelsea are now on top of the Premier League table with 18 points from nine games. Chelsea’s next Premier League fixture is against Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge on 29 November.

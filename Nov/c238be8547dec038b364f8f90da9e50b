The Oluwo of Iwo, AbdulRasheed Akanbi has declared to lead the next End SARS protest if youths approached him whenever the need arises. He opined that a protest like the just concluded End SARS without leadership will not work. Oluwo said a reasonable role way to organise protest is to be ready for dialogue with the government. The monarch said he was ready to lead the youth in any genuine protest as a way to make their demands get to the authorities concerned. Oba Akanbi spoke in Osogbo during an interactive programme organized by Osun State government tagged “Osun #ENDSARS Aftermath Stakeholders’ Engagement” “Next time, if you want to organise a protest and you don’t have anyone to lead you, you may be afraid that they may kill you or you are afraid of being arrested, come to me, I will lead the protest. “There is no way you can organise protest without leadership. You must give room for dialogue because it is the leadership that will eventually sit down and discuss with the government. That is the only way you can fight and get your demands to government”, Oluwo said.

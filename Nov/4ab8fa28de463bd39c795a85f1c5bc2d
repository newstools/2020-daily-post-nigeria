Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has admitted he made a “stupid mistake” when he tripped Hector Bellerin, to concede a penalty in their 1-0 defeat to Arsenal on Sunday. Pogba clipped Bellerin’s ankle in the United penalty box, prompting referee Mike Dean to point to the spot. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang sent David De Gea the wrong way, to seal the victory for Mikel Arteta’s team. It also means United have lost three times in the league so far and failed to win at Old Trafford. Pogba has now suggested he conceded the penalty because he was “out of breath”. “I thought I would touch the ball but I didn’t. I cost us the goal today with the penalty. “I felt like I touched him a bit, I knew I was in the box, I shouldn’t have given a penalty away like that. Maybe I was a bit out of breath, it made me do this stupid mistake,” he told BBC Sport.

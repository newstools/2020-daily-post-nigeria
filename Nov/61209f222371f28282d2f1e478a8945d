Senator Ali Ndume, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army, says that President Muhammadu Buhari is not the problem of the present government. Senator Ndume, while appearing on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics, said the president is being betrayed by some kleptocrats in his government who have refused to implement policies. According to him, “Buhari is a genuine person that has the interest of the common man at heart but is being betrayed by some kleptocrats in the government.” Ndume declared that the president has achieved on all counts, but there are some people he appointed who are failing to implement the policies as a result of this giving his administration problems. “Buhari has integrity and the competence but unfortunately, the kleptocrats in the government have formed the majority and therefore are betraying the laudable policies that he wants to implement. “The President cannot do it all by himself, so he had to appoint persons to act in various capacities, but some have failed to deliver on the job,” he said. Ndume argued that Buhari has performed on all counts of his administration with three major agendas which are to secure the country, to fight corruption, and to provide infrastructure. He, however, noted that the implementation of certain policies as put forth by the president is where the problem lies.

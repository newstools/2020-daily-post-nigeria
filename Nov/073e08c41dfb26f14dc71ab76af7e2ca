The transition team of Joe Biden is dissatisfied that the former Senator has not been recognized by the United States authorities. According to Associated Press, Biden of the Democratic Party won 290 electoral votes, and
76,343,332 vote count. President Donald Trump of the Republican Party secured 214 electoral votes, and 71,444,567 vote count. But the General Services Administration (GSA) has remained silent on the declaration of Biden as president-elect. The independent agency must formally recognize election winners before they can commence transition tasks. The GSA delay may not be unconnected to Trump’s rejection of the results. The President is filing legal action in several states over allegations of fraud. Biden’s team say they may sue the federal government for refusing to acknowledge him as winner of the November 3 election. “Legal action is certainly a possibility, but there are other options as well that we’re considering,” an official told Reuters. The official said with the current situation, Biden cannot access classified information, as well as federal funds to pay salaries, consultants, travel expenses, among others.

Governor Aminu Masari of Katsina State, on Monday, revealed that synergy between Nigerian Army, Air Force and other security agencies is the only way to end banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and other criminalities in the country. Masari disclosed this in an interview with NAN during his site inspection of the proposed Nigerian Air Force landing site in Funtua. “There must be synergy between the Army, Air Force and other security agencies towards tackling the menace,” Masari said. “The governors in North-West and North-Central zones can’t do anything because they don’t have the expertise or knowledge of fighting, it is the soldiers that are trained to fight. “I, therefore, urge the Army, the Air Force to go back to their drawing board and strategize and fashion out how to synergize. “Our role is to provide logistics and necessary support to enable them to succeed to arrest the situation.”

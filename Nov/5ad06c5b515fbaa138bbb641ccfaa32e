Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) has sent good wishes to Joe Biden. The Democratic candidate is expected to emerge as the 46th President of the United Sates. “Congratulations to President-elect @JoeBiden & Vice President-Elect @KamalaHarris! My @WHO colleagues and I look forward to working with you and your teams. “Crises like the #COVID19 pandemic show the importance of global solidarity in protecting lives and livelihoods. Together!”, Ghebreyesus tweeted. Trump stopped funding for the WHO at the peak of the pandemic. The President formally notified the United Nations (UN) and the U.S. Congress that America will exit the agency in July 2021. In his reaction, Biden promised to reverse the decision on his first day in office if elected. The president-elect stressed that citizens are safer when the U.S. is engaged in strengthening global health. “On my first day as president, I will rejoin the WHO and restore our leadership on the world stage”, the former Senator said. “Trump had earlier said, ”We will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs.” He further asserted that China has total control of the organization despite paying $40 million per year compared to what the U.S. has been paying. Trump puts the figure at approximately $450 million a year.

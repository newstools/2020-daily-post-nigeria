The Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency (BSPHCDA) on Monday commenced its annual Operational Development Plan (AOP) meeting for the development of primary health care activities. A statement signed by the Information Officer of the Agency, Ibrahim Sani and made available to DAILY POST said the meeting was to design a practicable template to chart a governance structure guiding the health sector specialists, partners and stakeholders for 2021. Sani informed that discussion at the meeting centred on data generation and improvement, adding that the operational plan arrived at would serve as an “all-inclusive” document that addresses sector-wide priorities for 2021. “The 1-year plan takes into account the prioritised interventions and recovery plan, with an expanded scope to ensure it covers the wider MoH-PHC needs and plans for an improved health sector. “The PHC 2021 annual operational plan harmonises all plans within the Agency and is considered a useful document in guiding partners and programme officers on the priority areas for support. “It is hoped that this operational plan will become another reference document for health programmes and services; as well as for resource mobilisation in a collective effort to revamp the health system in Bauchi State,” the Information Officer stated. He added that in tandem with efforts to contain all epidemic as well as infectious diseases, the BSPHCDA, under its Executive Chairman, Dr Rilwanu Mohammed and its partners have been making efforts to develop a reliable PHC Plan. This Sani stated, is being done with the state government’s priorities focusing on the reduction of maternal and infant mortality, promoting patient and health worker safety in health facilities and strengthening immunization and integrated disease surveillance and response, among other initiatives. According to Sani, the meeting had in attendance stakeholders from within and outside the state, including the Executive Chairman, BSPHCDA, Dr Rilwan Mohammed; representatives of National Primary Health Centre Development Agency (NPHCDA); UNICEF, World Health Health (WHO); BMGF; Dangote Foundation; representatives of the state Ministry of Health; BACATMA, and BACSHMA, among others.

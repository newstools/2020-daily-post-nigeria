Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has dismissed rumours of the alleged disappearance of male genitals through mystical powers in the State. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the alleged claims had led to acts of arson in Daudu in the Guma Local Government Area of the State. Reacting, Ortom said such rumours was “baseless and the handiwork of mischief makers.” Ortom, who refuted the claims when he visited Daudu in Guma Local Government Area, where the alleged genital disappearance occurred, explained that “there was no single confirmed case of the incident”. According to him, the claims were only meant to encourage hatred and underdevelopment of the area. He expressed regrets that while the people had yet to recover from the effects of herders’ attacks, “it was unthinkable for the youth in the area to embark on destruction of property for a nonexistent disappearance of genital organs”. The governor, who requested those with complaints of missing genital organs to present themselves for physical examination, only one person turned out but could not prove his claim of genital disappearance hence his male organ was still intact. Ortom appealed to the people to refrain from resorting to jungle justice and to report all criminal activities to the security agencies.

Some governors of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and chieftains of the party have visited former President, Goodluck Jonathan, as pressure continues to mount on him to contest the 2023 election. They visited Jonathan at his Abuja residence to felicitate with him on his 63rd birthday anniversary. Those who visited the former president include: Yobe State Governor, Mai Mala Buni; Ebonyi State Governor, David Umahi, Kebbi State Governor, Atiku Bagudu and Jigawa State Governor, Abubakar Badaru. Also an ex-President of the Senate, who is a chieftain of the APC, Ken Nnamani, was on the visit. It is, however, not clear if the APC chieftains had presented a Presidential proposal to Jonathan during the visit. Jonathan, who served one term after completing the tenure of late President, Musa Yarâ€™Adua was defeated by President Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. However, there have been calls lately for Jonathan to run for his final tenure as president after Buhari in 2023.

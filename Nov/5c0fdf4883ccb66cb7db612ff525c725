President Muhammadu Buhari has received the Report of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry on the Investigation of Ibrahim Magu, Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)’ Receiving the Report of the commission headed by Justice Ayo Salami (Rtd), at State House, Abuja, President Buhari said he hopes to make Nigeria a country with no tolerance for corruption. ”Corruption is present in all countries. Some Governments treat it with levity. Some fight it all the time. I want Nigeria to be counted among those countries that do not tolerate but fight corruption.” To protect Nigeria’s political and economic systems, and the continued existence of the Nigerian State from the serious threat of corruption, the President called on all stakeholders, and indeed every Nigerian to own the fight against corruption at their respective levels. Buhari called on all stakeholders and every Nigerian to own the fight against corruption at their respective levels. ”The sad reality confronting us as a people is that there is corruption almost everywhere; at many levels of government, and nearly every stratum of our society,” Buhari added. ”However, the stark reality of widespread corruption becomes poignant when allegations of corruption touches on the leadership of an institution set up by law to coordinate and enforce all economic and financial crimes. It is an abomination that strikes at the root, and undermines the Government’s anti-corruption programme. ”Let it be known that in the fight against corruption, no one is too big to tackle, as no individual is bigger than the Nigerian State!” Ibrahim Magu, who acted as the EFCC Chairman from 2015 to 2020, was suspended by President Buhari and replaced with the director of operations, Mohammed Umar Abba at the anti graft agency.

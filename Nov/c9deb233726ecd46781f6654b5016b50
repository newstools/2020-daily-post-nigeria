Arsenal midfielder, Dani Ceballos, has labelled reports that he and fellow teammate, David Luiz, were involved in a fight during a training session as “FAKE”. Ceballos said this ahead of Arsenal’s Premier League clash against Leeds United this weekend. Recall that David Ornstein of The Athletic had earlier reported on Thursday that tensions had boiled over between Ceballos and Luiz during an argument on Arsenal’s training ground. Ornstein also details the alleged confrontation between the pair. “David Luiz took exception to a challenge by Dani Ceballos and retaliated by hitting him in the face, a scratch drawing blood,” Ornstein wrote on Twitter. “Luiz is said to have struck Ceballos on the nose, sending him to the ground. When Ceballos got up to confront Luiz, teammates and staff stepped in to diffuse the scuffle.” However, Ceballos responded in a tweet via his Twitter handle on Thursday, describing it as “FAKE” to his 600,000-plus followers. Meanwhile, Ceballos and another Gunners teammate, Eddie Nketiah, were involved in a short quarrel alteration during the warm-up Arsenal’s match against Fulham in the Premier League at Craven Cottage.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-855527" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ceballos.jpg" alt="" width="565" height="242" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ceballos.jpg 565w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ceballos-300x128.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px">

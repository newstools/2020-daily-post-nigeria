The member representing Ebonyi North West State Constituency in the state house of Assembly, Hon Victor Aleke has been suspended indefinitely over alleged misconduct and failure to follow due process in the management of the house internally generated revenue, IGR. Motion for his suspension was moved by the leader of the house and member representing Ezza North West state constituency, Hon Victor Chukwu and seconded by one other whose name was yet to be identified. Hon. Chukwu argued that the House recently set up a committee on IGR which was treated with disdain by Hon Victor Aleke. The leader of the house faulted the behaviour of the Honourable member in the discharge of his official duties which he maintained negates the ideal of the Honourable House. The speaker of the house, Mr. Francis Nwifuru, however, put the motion for the suspension of Hon Aleke into votes and it was unanimously adopted by the members of the house in a voice vote. Addressing journalists shortly after the plenary, the Chairman, House Committee on Information, Hon Chukwu Arinze Lukas said: “the house has a rule. There are things you don’t do as an honourable member and anybody that flouts the rule of the house should be suspended and he is not the only one that has been suspended in the house because of such thing. “He happens to violate the rule and it has nothing to do with defection or any political party. It was the issue of the committee that was set up and it was clearly stated at the chamber, it has nothing to do with political affairs. “His offence anyway is misconduct. He did not follow the rule of the IGR committee that was set up by the house because he refused to operate with the engagement of the committee and that’d is why the Committee recommended his suspension” he stated.

Deji Adeyanju, popular activist, has called for the resignation or impeachment of President Muhammadu Buhari. Adeyanju, co-convener of Concerned Nigerians Group, said the spate of kidnapping on Kaduna-Abuja road was enough reason for the president to resign or be impeached. He made the call while alleging that over 100 people are abducted along that route at times. Tweeting, Adeyanju wrote: “The number of people abducted on Kaduna road alone is enough to make a president resign or be impeached. “Several sources say sometimes over 100 people are abducted on that road and the issues go unreported.” Over time, the spate of insecurity in the North had been alarming, especially kidnapping and banditry. On November 17, 2020, nine students of the Ahmadu Bello University, ABU, Zaria were abducted and a ransom of N270m was demanded. This led to Datti Garba, a member of the House of Representatives moving a motion to fence the university.

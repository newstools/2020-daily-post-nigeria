Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted that Paul Pogb, made a mistake by giving away the penalty, which saw Arsenal win 1-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday. It was the Gunners’ first victory away at United in 14 years. Although Mikel Arteta’s men dominated the match, they needed a spot kick to claim all three points. Willian released Hector Bellerin down the right and the Spanish fullback was fouled in the area. Referee Mike Dean immediately pointed to the spot and captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang slotted past David De Gea. Just stay on your feet there, Pogba knows he’s made a mistake,” Solskjaer told reporters after the game. United now have seven points from their first six fixtures.

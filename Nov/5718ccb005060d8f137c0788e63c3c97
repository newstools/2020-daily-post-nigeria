An Ebonyi State indigene, one Rexlawson Jonson, has been arrested by the police in Ogun State for alleged murder. The 31-year-old man, police said, was apprehended on Friday, October 30, “over the gruesome murder of his girlfriend one 26-year-old Patricia John.” The Ogun State Police Spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST in a statement on Monday, that the arrest of the suspect followed a report by one Adebayo Aladesuyi, who is the Manager of Molayo Hotel in Ibafo. The hotel Manager was said to have reported that “while they were carrying out routine check of the hotel rooms, they discovered the dead body of the occupant of one of the rooms with bruises on her neck suggesting that the deceased might have been strangulated.” On the strength of the report, the DPO of Ibafo Division, CSP Jide Joshua, had led his detectives to the scene and recovered the corpse to Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital (OOUTH) in Sagamu for post mortem. According to Oyeyemi, “preliminary investigation revealed that the deceased checked into the hotel with a man who sneaked out of the hotel after killing her.” “Consequently, the DPO and his men commenced technical and intelligence based investigation which led to unraveling the identity of the suspect. He was subsequently traced and apprehended by the detectives. “On interrogation, he confessed checking into the hotel with the deceased and that they had a misunderstanding which led to physical assault between them. In the process, he said the woman collapsed and gave up the ghost. He subsequently left the corpse in the room and sneaked out of the hotel.” DAILY POST learnt that the Commissioner of Police in Ogun, CP Edward Awolowo Ajogun, has ordered the transfer of the suspect to homicide section of the State CIID for investigation and prosecution. Ajogun urged all hoteliers in Ogun to always keep proper documentation of their customers in order to assist the police in situations like this.

The National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), Kaduna State Chapter has pleaded with the youth to shun any influenced behaviour capable of destabilizing the peaceful atmosphere of the state Comrade Bagudu Nathaniel Zonkwa who made the appeal during a one day Peace Conference with the theme: ‘Youth Collapsing the Divide’’, said, youths are the engine room of the government, hence, the need to do all they can to support government at all levels, to bridge the gaps that hitherto created avenues for sponsors and perpetrators of crises in the State. His words: “We must stand up against these enemies of peace and progress as youths. We must not be allowed to be used as agents of destruction and crisis any more”. “We, therefore, advise the state government to work closely with NYCN and other youth groups to ensure sustainable peace in the state,” he said According to him, “Though in Kaduna we have experienced youth inclusion in governance, we are urging the governor to ensure the youths are included in other aspects of business and development sectors. “Another purpose of the one day Peace meeting is to ignite youth leaders to champion and take action on things that affect us directly, such as illiteracy, poverty, unemployment and insecurity.” He urged the youths to avoid over-dependence on government and seek alternative sources of living.

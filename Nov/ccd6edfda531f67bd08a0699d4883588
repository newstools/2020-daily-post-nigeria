Barcelona presidential aspirant, Emili Rousaud, has said he would hold a referendum to name the Nou Camp after Lionel Messi, if he is elected in January. Rousaud is one of the candidates hoping to succeed Josep Maria Bartomeu as president at the beginning of 2021. As well as changing the name of the stadium, he has also vowed to re-sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain and another unnamed superstar player next summer. New manager, Ronald Koeman, has so far failed to lift the mood around the LaLiga club, with Messi yet to sign a new contract and set to become a free agent next summer. But Rousaud, perhaps in a desperate bid to keep the talismanic Argentine, has made the stadium name change one of his major policies when he assumes office. “We will hold a referendum to change the name of the stadium to Camp Nou – Leo Messi,” he said on Thursday, via Marca.

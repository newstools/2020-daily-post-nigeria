Former Manchester United star, Andy Cole, has named his five greatest strikers in Premier League history. Cole enjoyed a fine career in the EPL with Newcastle United and Manchester United, then latterly with the likes of Blackburn, Fulham and Manchester City. He sits third on the all-time list of Premier League goal-scorers with 187, only behind Alan Shearer (260) and Wayne Rooney (208). When asked to name his top five strikers of all time, Cole told Daily Mail: “[Sergio] Aguero, he would definitely be in there. “Rooney would be in there, [Ruud] Van Nistelrooy would have a shout.” Cole said Thierry Henry and Shearer are “a given” on the list.

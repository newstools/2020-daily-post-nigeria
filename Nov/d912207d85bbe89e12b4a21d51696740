Juventus manager, Andrea Pirlo, has defended his decision to rest Cristiano Ronaldo after they were held to a 1-1 draw at Benevento on Saturday. Alvaro Morata gave the Serie A champions the lead in the 21st minute, but the home side levelled in first-half stoppage time through Gaetano Letizia. Juve failed to find a winner in the second half and remain in fifth place in the league table. Pirlo’s side could go six points behind table-topping AC Milan if the Rossoneri win against Fiorentina on Sunday. After the draw, Pirlo explained why he left Ronaldo out of his squad. “He had a slight problem midweek and wanted to play in the Champions League anyway,” Pirlo told Sky Italia. “After international duty, it was natural he’d need some rest. Ronaldo is an added value, but we must try to play our game even in his absence.”

The leadership of the police and the Department of State Services (DSS) in Bauchi State on Monday pledged their unflinching commitment to peace and security in the state, even as they assured of redoubling their efforts towards ensuring maintenance of peace and security across the state. The State Director of Service, Alhaji Umar Abdullahi Yeldu and the Commissioner of Police, CP Lawan Tanko Jimeta, gave the pledge while speaking at a town hall meeting on the engagement of youths and communities on security issues organised by the Bauchi State government. DAILY POST reports that the meeting came up on the heel of the recent violence witnessed in parts of the country following the peaceful protests by youth seeking the disbandment of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) and an end to police brutalities, with the hashtag #EndSARS. Describing the town hall meeting as timely, Yeldu declared that it would go a long way in identifying security challenges in the state with a view to addressing them amicably. While saying that the youths are the country’s tomorrow leaders, the DSS Director called on them to collaborate with the Service by reporting any security issues to it for prompt action. “On behalf of the Director-General, Department of State Services, Yusuf Magaji Bichi, we want to pledge our unflinching support for the peace and security of Bauchi State. “We are aware that youths are the leaders of tomorrow and therefore this town hall meeting is timely and it is on this point that we call on youths and their leadership that if there is anything on security, they should reach out to us for prompt action,” he said. Yeldu then raised the alarm over increasing cases of kidnapping, banditry, rape and cattle rustling in the state and solicited continued support of critical stakeholders to the Service with a view to tackling the menace. He, however, expressed gratitude to the traditional and religious leaders in the state for the roles they have been playing to ensure security is guaranteed in the state. “Your Excellency, other high profile personalities, we are aware that Bauchi State is currently recording an increase in criminal activities but we appreciate our royal fathers, imams and pastors for the roles they played in ensuring security is maintained in the state. We thank you very much in that regard.” Also speaking at the meeting, the state Commissioner of Police, Lawan Tanko Jimeta, said the police are collaborating with youth groups to tackle and reduce their involvement in criminal activities and other social vices. Jimeta promised that security agencies in the state would redouble their efforts towards ensuring the maintenance of peace and security across the state. The town hall meeting was attended by dignitaries, including the state governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed; Minister of Education, Malam Adamu Adamu and Minister of State for Trade, Industry and Investment, Hajiya Maryam Yelwaji Katagum, among others. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-853058 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201102-WA0024.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201102-WA0024.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/IMG-20201102-WA0024-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">

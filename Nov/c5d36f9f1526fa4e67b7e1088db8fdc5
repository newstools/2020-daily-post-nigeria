Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, on Saturday, commiserated with former Senate Majority Leader, Mr Victor Ndoma-Egba over the death of his wife, Mrs Amaka Ndoma-Egba. Ayade, in a statement by Christian Ita, his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, in Calabar, expressed deep sadness over Amaka’s sudden transition. According to him, her demise was yet another vicissitude to befall the former Senate Leader in recent times. “Dear Victor, the death of your dear wife, is a severe blow on all of us who knew her, and a harder blow on you as her husband, friend and confidant. “Words cannot adequately convey my heartfelt sorrow over Amaka’s death, for she was a kind and beautiful soul who spread love to all who encountered her,” he said. The governor, however, urged Sen. Ndoma-Egba and his family to be consoled by the fact that the deceased selflessly and fervently served God and humanity during her salutary and impactful life on earth. While praying to God to give Ndoma-Egba the fortitude to bear the loss, Ayade prayed to God to grant her soul eternal peace.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Thursday, arraigned Murtala Sani, before Justice Mohammed Bello Shinkafi of the Zamfara State High Court. Sani faces a one count charge of criminal breach of trust. The accused had collected 1536 bags of rice worth N26,945,000 from the complainant, Rabi Bello Suleiman. Sani claimed he wanted to distribute them to Zamfara State Government staff, with the assurance that he will repay the money in two months. According to the EFCC, he fraudulently diverted the proceeds to his personal use. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the one count charge. Musa Isah, prosecution counsel, requested for a trial date in view of his plea. Gambo Isah, defense counsel, applied for bail for Sani. But Isah objected on the grounds that he jumped the administrative bail EFCC earlier granted. Justice Shinkafi refused the bail application and remanded the defendant in the custody of the Nigerian Correctional Service (NCS). The matter was adjourned until January 11, 2020 for trial.

Donny van de Beek’s agent, Sjaak Swart, has claimed Arsenal were keen on signing the player before the COVID-19 pandemic, but were ultimately unable to find the funds to complete the transfer. The Dutch midfielder has joined Manchester United, after the Gunners’ rivals agreed a £40m deal with Ajax. Tottenham, Barcelona and Real Madrid were also touted as possible destinations for Van de Beek in the past. But speaking to Ajax Showtime, Swart said Arsenal’s interest was among the strongest at the time. “They [Arsenal] really wanted him — they just couldn’t get the money for a transfer. Even the biggest clubs struggle. “Arsenal is a great club, but United will certainly be an interesting adventure.” Van de Beek has become Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s first summer signing.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Dorathy, has given reason she nominated Trikytee and Laycon for possible eviction. Dorathy’s team on Monday put up Laycon and Trikytee for eviction this week. The housemate, who survives Sunday’s eviction will get a spot in the finale. Giving reasons for nominating Laycon, Dorathy during her diary session with Biggie on Thursday night, said she chose Laycon because he has escaped been up for eviction sometimes. She added that her teammates also convinced her to choose Laycon. Dorathy said: “I and my teammates nominated Trikytee because he has been up and survived so it was not a personal thing but part of strategy. “It was also just part of strategy because I felt Laycon too has not been up so much.” She added that she does not regret her team’s nomination which had Vee and Neo emerge as finalists.

National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, has condemned the Department of State Services (DSS) for repeatedly inviting Obadiah Mailafia for interrogations. Warning the Buhari administration, the opposition leader added that no amount of pressure will deter the people from expressing their feelings under “a government that has clearly lost focus and direction. The former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had made an explosive revelation about the Southern Kaduna’s killings and the Boko Haram insurgency. Mailafia had disclosed that he and others met with some outlaws who told them that, “one of the northern governors is the commander of Boko Haram in Nigeria. Boko Haram and the bandits are one and the same. They have a sophisticated network.” The federal government, through the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), fined Nigeria Info FM which conducted the interview N5 million. In a statement on Tuesday, Secondus told the secret police organization to dispose themselves to the mood of the time in a democratic dispensation. He admonished the DSS to learn how to accommodate dissenting views on issues. The main opposition leader said that the continuous invitation of the ex-CBN top official “is disrespectful of his status and unmindful of his contributions to the development of this country.” Secondus stressed that the good ingredients of democracy is that citizens must be allowed to have their say even when they cannot have their way on any issue. He declared as repugnant, “the harassment of somebody who served this country at such high level just because he has a view different from that of the government on an issue.” The PDP leader noted that the DSS in traumatizing Mailafia “is trying to intimidate the people from airing their views on issues”.

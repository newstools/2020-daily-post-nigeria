The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has said Adams Oshiomhole and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, will continue to be a threat to Nigeria’s democracy, as long as they remain godfathers. Obaseki stated this while appearing on Arise TV on Tuesday. “The challenge with people like Oshiomhole and Ahmed Tinubu is that if they do not accept and change their style and attitude, they pose a big danger to our democracy because they are extra-constitutional players,” Obaseki said. “They constituted themselves into what they say they are without any constitutional responsibilities and try to overlord themselves over people who have constitutional authority and if we allow them to continue it will destroy our democracy,” he said. Obaseki fell out with Oshiomhole, his predecessor and a former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), ahead of the governorship election. Oshiomhole, who was instrumental in Obaseki’s victory in 2016, became his antagonist, taking sides with Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the APC. A few days to the polls, Tinubu, the APC’s National Leader, released a video clip urging the people of the state to vote Obaseki out. But Obaseki went on to win the election, beating Ize-Iyamu with a margin of 84,336 votes.

President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday explained that Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020 (CAMA) will enhance transparency and corporate accountability in the fight against corruption. He spoke in a video message presented at the Open Government Partnership (OGP) 2020 Virtual Leaders’ Summit on the sidelines of the 75th Session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA75) in New York. He said since the inception of his administration in 2015, the government has been committed to changing international and domestic perceptions regarding Nigeria’s commitment to fight corruption. ”We focused on the task of dealing head-on with this destructive monster, which led to us joining the Open Government Partnership and making reform commitments such as to establish a public central register of beneficial owners of corporate entities. “We have made significant progress in implementing tougher anti-corruption measures, including my recent assent to the Companies and Allied Matters Act, 2020. The Act provides a legal framework for the implementation of Beneficial Ownership Information Disclosure in Nigeria. ”Being an OGP member-country has helped Nigeria learn from other countries tackling similar challenges, and to build a coalition to support these reforms across the private sector and civil society. It has also aided our journey towards building citizens’ trust in government,” Buhari noted.

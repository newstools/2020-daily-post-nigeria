The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested Hajiya Hadiza Umar Abubakar for allegedly defrauding a job seeker, Nuradeen Abubakar of N3million. Dele Oyewale, EFCC spokesman, in a statement on Thursday, said she had made a promise of securing an EFCC job for the victim. “The suspect was arrested in a bank she sent her son to make a transaction, unaware that the EFCC had placed a Post No Debit (PND) on all her accounts”, he noted. The detention of Abubakar’s son in the bank forced her to show up and was arrested. EFCC disclosed that the suspect had charged the victim N6million. A part-payment of N3million was made into the suspect’s account on October 29, 2019, while the balance was to be paid after the provision of his Employment Letter. The letter was promised to be delivered on November 7, 2019, two weeks from the date of the part payment. In his petition, the victim revealed that he came in contact with the suspect through her son. He complained that since last year, there has been neither EFCC Employment Letter nor refund of the payment. The statement added that Hadiza Abubakar suspect will soon be charged to court.

Atiku Abubakar, a former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has condemned the alleged siege on Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike and some PDP governors by police in Edo State. Recall that PDP had in a statement on Friday raised the alarm that the hotel where Governor Wike is lodging in Benin, Edo State, was surrounded by over 300 policemen. The party’s chairman in Rivers State, Akawor Desmond made the allegation on Friday. Reacting, Atiku said blocking the hotel where the PDP Governors were being lodged is not a show of fairness. He tweeted, ”A promise of free & fair election cannot be mere lip service. It’s a commitment & should be demonstrated by way of equal access & restriction to every stakeholder. ”Blockading the hotel of @OfficialPDPNig governors in the eve of the Edo election isn’t a good way to show fairness.”

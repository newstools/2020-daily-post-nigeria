United States President Donald Trump says Russia may be wishing to see Joe Biden defeat him. Trump, 74, and Biden, 77, go head-to-head at the November 3 presidential election. “Russia – probably, they want Biden, because – look – nobody has been tougher to Russia than me”, Trump told FOX TV. “Nobody – with the [Nord Stream 2] pipeline, with the big military, we have become the number one energy country in the world.” Trump recalled the lethal weapons his administration delivered to Ukraine. “And, remember, Obama gave them pillows and I gave them tank-busters. It’s a big difference with Ukraine,” the American leader said. On August 7, the U.S. National Counter-Intelligence and Security Centre accused China, Russia and Iran of alleged interference in the 2020 poll. The centre said Russia was working in favour of Trump, while China was accused of supporting Biden. Barely one month later, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) accused Russia of attempting to discredit mail-in voting. DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis said the plan was to dissuade Americans from voting.

Donny van de Beek had agreed a move to Real Madrid last year before signing for Manchester United this summer and was left ‘angry’ when it fell through. The 23-year-old sealed a move from Ajax to Old Trafford this week for an initial fee of £35m. But the Dutch midfielder had expected to make a different switch, after agreeing a deal with Real last summer. Van de Beek was still in talks with the LaLiga giants until January, before the COVID-19 pandemic broke out. “Everything was agreed with Madrid, but for some reason it fell through. “At the time I was angry. I wondered if that sort of opportunity would come round again. “I guess it was because the club [Real] couldn’t sell the players they had planned to,” Van de Beek told De Telegraaf.

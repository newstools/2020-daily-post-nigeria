Mavin Producer, Don Jazzy, has mocked Big Brother Naija, BBNaija Lockdown housemates, Nengi and Ozo, over their ‘Situation-ship’ in the house. Recall that Ozo had always made it clear that he loved Nengi and would love to spend the rest of his life with her, even though she had stated countless times that she would not want to have a relationship in the house. On Friday morning, Nengi also cautioned Ozo to stay away from her and let her have her personal space, adding that they are just friends. However, reacting to the development, Don Jazzy in a video on his official Twitter handle on Friday, counted the number of times Nengi has told Ozo they are just friends. “How many times has Nengi told Ozo that they are just friends,” He tweeted.

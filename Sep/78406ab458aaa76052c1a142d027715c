FC Porto full-back, Alex Telles, has agreed terms with Manchester United over a five-year contract, RMC reports. Telles has emerged as a target for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who is looking to improve on his options at left-back. The 27-year-old will compete with Luke Shaw and Brandon Williams. Telles was previously linked with Chelsea, before the Blues opted for Ben Chilwell. United are now looking to agree on a fee with Porto for the player. If the deal goes through, Telles will join Donny van de Beek as United’s second major arrival of the summer transfer window. Paris Saint-Germain are also said to be keen on Telles, who has been valued at £27million.

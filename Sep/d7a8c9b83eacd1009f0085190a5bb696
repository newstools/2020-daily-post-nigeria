Ibrahim Magu, suspended Acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has urged the Judicial Commission of Inquiry investigating him to summon Abubakar Malami, the Attorney General of the Federation, AGF. Magu explained that Malami should appear before the panel so his lawyers can cross-examine him on the credibility of the allegations he made. The suspended EFCC Chairman made the appeal in a letter dated September 4, 2020, and sent to the panel by his lawyer, Wahab Shittu. Magu, in the letter, sought for permission to subpoena Malami to appear before the panel. Stressing that he is entitled to fair hearing as guaranteed under the constitution, Magu explained that his fundamental human right allows him to “confront his main accuser.” The letter reads partly: “We hereby apply for the issuance of a Subpoena Ad Testificandum and Subpoena Duces Tecum on the Honourable Attorney General of the Federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami (SAN) to appear before this Judicial Commission of Inquiry to give evidence concerning his memo to the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari in connection with the subject matter of this inquiry titled: ‘FLAGRANT ABUSE OF PUBLIC OFFICE AND OTHER INFRACTIONS COMMITTED BY MR. IBRAHIM MAGU, ACTING CHAIRMAN ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL CRIMES COMMISSION (EFCC) BEING EXTRACTS OF PENDING PETITIONS’.”

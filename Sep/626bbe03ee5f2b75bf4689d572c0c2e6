The Commissioner of Police in Ogun State, Edward Ajogun, said operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) have arrested six suspected armed robbers, who he said have been pretending to be soldiers. According to Ajogun, the robbery suspects operating in military uniforms, were specialised in robbing passengers on the popular Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Parading them on Tuesday, Ajogun identified the suspects as: Ikechukwu Alore, Ifeanyi Emmanuel, Chibueze Kingsley, Obiora Michael, Elias John and Vincent Magnus, The police boss said they were arrested at different hideouts within and outside the state by the SARS operatives. Ajogun stated further that the gang leader, Obiora Michael, had earlier sustained bullet wounds during an encounter with the police. He was said to have been traced  to his house in Ajangbadi area of Lagos State on September 17. The Police Commissioner said his wife was seen treating the wounds, which he lied to his wife was sustained in a road accident. Obiora who claimed he “hustles” at Alaba International market, Lagos, told newsmen that he regrets his action, saying he had earlier left the gang because they used to shortchange while sharing proceeds from their robbery operations, adding that he rejoined them later.

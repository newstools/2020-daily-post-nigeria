The Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) suit seeking the disqualification of Osagie Ize-iyamu from the September 19 governorship election in Edo State was not heard on Tuesday. Hearing was stalled at the Federal High Court in Abuja due to a motion by the All Progressives Congress (APC). The PDP had in a suit marked FHC/ABJ/CS/69/20 prayed the court for an order disqualifying Ize-iyamu on account of not being validly nominated by the APC. The suit was filed on July 3, 2020 by PDP lawyers led by Ferdinand Orbih (SAN). PDP is claiming that Ize-iyamu was not a product of a valid primary election hence, should not be allowed to participate in the forthcoming election. Defendants are Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APC and Ize-iyamu. Initially instituted in the Benin Division of the Federal High Court, the suit was transferred to the Abuja Division owing to the annual vacation of the Federal High Court. Orbih told the court that he was served APC’s Notice of Preliminary Objection Tuesday morning. He prayed the court for a short adjournment to study the development. Justice Ahmed Mohammed confirmed the notice from counsel to the APC, Tunde Adejumo. Lawyers to INEC, Alhassan Umar (SAN) and Wole Olanipekun (SAN) also requested for time to respond to the motion.

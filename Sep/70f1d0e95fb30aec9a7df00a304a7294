Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has refused to answer questions over transfer target, Houssem Aouar, during his Friday press conference ahead of the trip to Fulham. Lyon has emerged as Arteta’s priority signing this summer, along with Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey. The Gunners have already signed Willian on a free transfer and fellow Brazilian Gabriel from Lille. Dani Ceballos is also back on a one-year loan deal from Real Madrid. Arteta, who is eyeing more signings especially in the midfield, however, refused to give details of his plans in the market. “We are still active in the market, we are looking at different options,” he said. “I would say we are active in the market for players in and out, at the moment the squad balance is not the ideal we want to achieve so there is still some work to do.” When asked specifically about Aouar, Arteta said: “I don’t want to talk about players from other clubs.”

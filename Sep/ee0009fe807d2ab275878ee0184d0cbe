The Adamawa State Government has declared October 12, 2020, as the resumption date for all schools in the state. The government specified on Thursday that all public and private schools across the state will reopen October 12th, after months of vacation forced by the COVID-19 pandemic. Governor Ahmadu Fintiri issued the directive amid regrets that COVID-19 caused long closure of schools and some other vital sectors of the economy, according to a statement signed by his Press Secretary, Mr Humwashi Wonosikou. Fintiri said, “I am pleased to announce Monday, October 12th as the date for the resumption of academic activities from the basic to tertiary levels, having wasted so much time.” The governor added that his government would do all within its power to ensure the enforcement of COVID-19 safety protocols. “Consequently, the Governor has directed the Ministry of Education and Human Capital Development to meet with stakeholders in the sector to discuss modalities for the reopening,” the statement added. It said the governor advised parents to do their part in preparing their children to resume school in light of the COVID-19 exigencies.

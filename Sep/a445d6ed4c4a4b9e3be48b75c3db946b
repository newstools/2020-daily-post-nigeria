Seven suspected political thugs were on Tuesday remanded by a Magistrate Court sitting in Akure for alleged possession of firearms.

According to the Director of Public Prosecution, Grace Olowoporoku, the suspects were caught with locally made single and double barrel guns totalling seven with live cartridges and thereby committing a felony contrary to and punishable under section 3 (1) of the robbery and firearms (Special Provisions) Act Cap R11 Vol. 14 Law of the Federation of Nigeria 2004.

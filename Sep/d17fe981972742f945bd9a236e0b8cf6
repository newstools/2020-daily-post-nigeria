An Osogbo Magistrates â€˜ Court in Osun has ordered the remand of Femi Michael, 35, at the Ilesa Correctional Centre for alleged sexual assault. The police charged Michael, a resident of Kolawole Street, Esuyale Compound in Osogbo, with sexual assault. The prosecutor, Insp. Adeoye Kayode, narrating the incident to the court said the defendant committed the offence on Sept. 27, at 8:00pm at Kolawole Street, Esuyale Compound in Osogbo. Kayode explained that the defendant assaulted a minor by removing her underwear and inserting his fingers into her private parts, NAN reports. The prosecutor also said that the offence contravened Sections 359, 222, and 249 (d) of the Criminal Code, Cap. 34 Vol. 11, Laws of Osun, 2002. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. The defence counsel, Mr Kingsley Nwoke, requested the court to grant bail to the defendant in the most liberal terms. The presiding Magistrate, Mr Abayomi Ajala, ruled that the defendant be remanded in prison at the Ilesa Correctional Centre due to the gravity of his offence. The Magistrate, however, overruled the bail application and adjourned the case until Oct. 16 for ruling on bail.

Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen, on Friday evening scored his second hat-trick for the club in their 4-0 victory against Italian third division side, Teramo. Osimhen’s three goals against Teramo took his tally to six in two pre-season friendlies for Napoli. The 21-year-old only joined the Serie A side last month from Lille. DAILY POST recalls that the Nigerian international had grabbed a debut hat-trick for his club last week as Napoli demolished L’Aquila 11-0 in a pre-season friendly. Osimhen netted an early first goal for Napoli after just four minutes into the game before Hirving Lozano doubled the lead for Gennaro Gattuso’s men. The attacker then scored two goals in the second half of the encounter to give Napoli the victory against Teramo. He was later substituted in the 75th minute for Fernando Llorente.

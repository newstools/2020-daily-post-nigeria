Media Mogul, Dele Momodu has advised viewers of Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 to stop promoting ‘poverty mentality’. Momodu on Friday said BBNaija is about entertainment and branding opportunities for housemates, adding that the criteria for winning should not be about the poorest housemate. According to him, winning the grand prize of N85m would not make any housemate the richest at the end of the game. Momodu said this on his Twitter page, even as he showed support for the billionaire’s son, Kiddwaya. His tweet read: “This show is not just about money, it is about ENTERTAINMENT and BRANDING opportunities for the housemates. Please, let’s stop promoting POVERTY mentality. “Winning won’t make you the richest HOUSEMATE! Let’s play and enjoy the game by voting for the perfect gentleman who rocks, Kiddwaya!” Meanwhile, there are eleven housemates remaining in the house to battle for the grand prize of N85m in the next three weeks

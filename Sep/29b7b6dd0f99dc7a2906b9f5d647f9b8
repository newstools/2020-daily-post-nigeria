Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has revealed that Timo Werner suffered cramp and was unable to take a penalty in their penalty shootout defeat against Tottenham. Werner scored his first goal for the Blues in the first half, as they took a 1-0 lead. However, Erik Lamela equalized late in the game, to take the game to a shootout. Werner had been expected to take a spot-kick, but the German striker was suffering from cramp in the final minutes. Lampard asked Werner if he wanted to take a penalty, but he declined, fearing he could worsen his pain. “We spoke to the players. You work on penalties and try and have a plan but it’s very difficult to know. “Timo had some cramp at the end and Timo would have probably taken one so we had to adjust around that,” Lampard told Sky Sports.

The Nigerian government has said no decision has been taken on the reopening of tertiary institutions in the country. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, the Minister of State for Education disclosed this during the daily briefing of the Presidential Taskforce on COVID-19 in Abuja. Nwajiuba, however, said universities would need to get clearance and procedures from the National Universities Commission (NUC) before reopening. The minister also disclosed that the government was reviewing the guidelines regarding the reopening of universities across the country. “But at the tertiary level, that guidance will also be done in collaboration with the National Universities Commission so that it will give clearance that we are satisfied with your performance with regards to the guideline. “What we are doing is that we are reducing this whole gamut of documents into some measurable steps towards reopening. What that means is that the governing council of each institution will then review the guideline and benchmark it,” he said.

Former England striker, Michael Owen, has predicted that both Arsenal and Manchester United, will pick up maximum points in Saturday’s Premier League fixtures. The Gunners began their campaign with a 3-0 drubbing of Fulham at Craven Cottage last weekend. Mikel Arteta’s men host West Ham at the Emirates in the late kick-off. United, however, will be playing their first league game of the season, after they were given an extended break. The Red Devils welcome Crystal Palace, who already have three points, to Old Trafford. “I think this is going to be a long and difficult season for Roy Hodgson and his team. “I see this ending in a comfortable 2-0 home win for Manchester United,” Owen told BetVictor. On Arsenal’s game, he added: “Arsenal looked very impressive in their opening match against Fulham and Mikel Arteta has certainly improved their shape, style, and confidence since he took over. “The Gunners really do look to be heading in the right direction…. A comfortable 3-0 victory for the Gunners for me in this one.”

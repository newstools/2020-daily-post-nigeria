A former Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, has claimed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) would have collapsed, if not for President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking with selected journalists in his Abuja home, Okorocha stated that it was the respect some APC stalwarts have for Buhari, that is keeping the ruling party together. According to him, unless the party goes back to the four pillars that formed the APC, namely the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC), the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the All Nigeria People Party (ANPP), APC will continue to struggle. “There is no more APC. What we have is respect for President Muhammadu Buhari, that is what is keeping us together. What we have is our respect for the person of President Buhari and we still believe that something can be done. “That trust and respect are what we still call APC. Outside that respect for President Buhari and the trust and belief that he could wake up one day and correct all these injustices and make it fine, nothing is happening. “If not that, I don’t think there is anything like APC, because people are beginning to get fed up. Again, PDP is not even better, the party has its own challenges,” Okorocha said.

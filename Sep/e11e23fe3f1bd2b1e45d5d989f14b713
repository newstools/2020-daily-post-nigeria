Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Laycon has made a shocking revelation about himself. Laycon, one of the finalists of the BBNaija reality show, disclosed that he is a sickle cell carrier. He disclosed this during a conversation with the other BBNaija finalists last night. The UNILAG graduate, however, stated that he does not like to share information about his blood group to people. He explained that people start feeling sorry for him whenever he reveals his blood group. According to Laycon: “My blood group is Sickle Cell, I don’t like to tell people my genotype because I feel they will think I’m sick.” Responding, Dorathy said Laycon’s genotype could be the reason he’s not fat. “Guess that is why you are thin,” Dorathy said.

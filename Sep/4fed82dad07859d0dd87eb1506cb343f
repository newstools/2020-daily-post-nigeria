The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma has admitted that his government has not done well in clearing workers and pensionerâ€™s salaries, attributing the backdrop to alleged payroll fraudsters feeding fat from the state treasury. In a press release signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Oguwuike Nwachukwu, the Governor expressed his displeasure while addressing his cabinet on Thursday during an expanded exco meeting at the Government House, Owerri. The Governor, according to the release, described the situation as bad and unhealthy to the government, adopting a more workable method to sanitizing the system in order to have accurate data of all civil servants and pensioners. He appealed to the workers not to politicize the issue of salaries and pensions as he noted that civil servants are not politicians by their positions. He further appealed to all revenue-generating agencies in the state to assist the government in improving the monthly Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) to be able to offset the bills. He promised that all genuine claims by any civil servant in the state in terms of salaries and pensions will be cleared in due course, urging the workers to keep faith in the government. The Governor utilized the opportunity to distribute the authentic Staff Nominal Rolls of MDAs and parastatals, charging the heads of departments to go back to make necessary inputs towards achieving a better result.

Former Arsenal player, Paul Merson, has predicted that Chelsea can challenge for the Premier League title this season after spending brilliantly during the summer transfer window. Having finished in the fourth position last season, Chelsea have so far signed the likes of Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Thiago Silva, Kai Havertz, Ben Chilwell, and Malang Sarr and are also close to signing a new goalkeeper. But Merson believes if Frank Lampard’s side can get the best out of Silva this season, they have a chance to compete with Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United for the title. “Chelsea have bought brilliantly,” Merson told Sky Sports. “Ben Chilwell is a great signing. Thiago Silva looks a shrewd piece of business, and he is a proper centre-half. “If Chelsea can get a good year out of him, they have a chance. “With the quality of players purchased, it is clear Roman Abramovich [Chelsea owner] is not playing for the fourth spot, Chelsea are there to really have a go this season for the title, and they’ve a chance.”

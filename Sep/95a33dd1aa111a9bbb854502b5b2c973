The Kano Public Complaints and Anti Corruption body has recovered over Seven million naira diverted from the State Ministry of Agriculture. Already the Commission has quizzed the Ministry’s Permanent Secretary and indicted top officials of the Ministry over the alleged Fraud. However, the anti Corruption body denied launching Investigation into the Financial activities of the State Deputy Governor, Dr Nasiru Gawuna who doubles as the State Commissioner for Agriculture. The Commission cleared that Investigation into the Ministry of Agriculture involved only some staff of the Ministry and not the Deputy Governor as portrayed. The Commission said it invited the Permanent Secretary, Director Livestock and other staff of the Ministry over the investigation of the financial activities of the ministry. It alleged that the offence under investigation contradicts Section 26 of the Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission Law 2008 (as amended) and recovery of N 7,150,000.00 has so far been made. The Commission Chairman Barrister Muhuyi Magaji Rimin Gado said any attempt to involve the Deputy Governor in the investigation will be considered sensational, false and misleading. “For the clarity of doubt, the investigation was initiated with full consent, support and cooperation of His Excellency, the Deputy Governor, Dr Nasiru Gawuna.” Therefore the Commission urged the public to disregard any false information suggesting that the Deputy Governor is under investigation.

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has reacted to a bust-up between Dani Ceballos and Eddie Nketiah, before their 3-0 win at Fulham on Saturday. Both players were taking part in a Rondo alongside the rest of the bench when the Spaniard went in a little too hard on Nketiah. The young striker took exception to Ceballos seemingly leaving a little bit on him, and reacted by blasting the ball at him. This resulted in Ceballos squaring up to Nketiah and the two players pushing each other before their team-mates intervened. Arteta claims he did not see the incident. “I haven’t seen anything. I was inside,” he told BT Sport.

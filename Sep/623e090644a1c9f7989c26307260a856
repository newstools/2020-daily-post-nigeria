In the one minute video, the APC chieftain said “In life, you work hard and leave God for the outcome. You do your best and trust God to bless your efforts. I feel good, I feel strong, thank God. In life, you win some and you lose some but life goes on”, he philosophised. He further stated that he was moved to tears and inspired by the determination of the aged and nursing mothers who endured the harsh weather to cast their ballots. “If septuagenarians were not frustrated because card their card readers are not working, it inspired me that if at their age they don’t give up, why should I give up.” “And I ask our people to have faith in our country because we are not going to have another one. This is our country and we must make it great. We must strengthen democracy, we must improve on it. “No matter the outcome of an election, or a particular edition of a process, have faith in God and have faith in our country.”

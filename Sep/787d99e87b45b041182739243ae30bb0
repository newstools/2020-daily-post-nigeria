Hollywood actor, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson has revealed that he and his family members had all tested positive for the coronavirus. The world’s highest-paid actor revealed this in a video shared on his Instagram page. The Rock said he, his wife and two daughters got infected with the virus from a close family friend despite being “disciplined” about health protection. “The positive tests were a kick in the gut,” he said. He, however, added that they have all recovered. “We are on the other end of it and no longer contagious. Thank God, we are all healthy,” he said. The actor stressed that the two weeks his wife Lauren, and daughters Jasmine and Tiana, aged four and two, contracted COVID-19 has been the most challenging time his family had to endure. “Testing positive for Coronavirus is a lot different than overcoming nasty injuries, or being evicted or even being broke, which I have been more than a few times,” he added. He warned the general public to stop making the idea of wearing masks as a political agenda, adding that it has nothing to do with politics but the right thing to do. “My number 1 priority now is to always protect my family. “We are counting our blessings right now because we are all aware that it is not always the case that you get on the other end of COVID-19 stronger and healthier,” his post noted.

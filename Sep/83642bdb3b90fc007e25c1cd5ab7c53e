Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has said that Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, may be slammed a travel ban by the United States of America after the Edo election. Bamgbose commended and applauded the intervention of the United States, the United Kingdom in bringing sanity to Nigeria’s democratic process. He noted that the introduction of a visa ban on politicians has made this possible, adding that it is a bold attempt to checkmate election riggers and those who are found to be undermining democracy. The senior lawyer pointed out that the most recent visa ban reportedly affected Adams Oshiomhole, former National Chairman of the APC is quite unfortunate, adding that the development presupposes that the government of APC is questionable. Governor Ganduje and Governor Yahaya Bello were equally said to have been found to be election riggers and undermining democracy in Nigeria, and Bamgbose said that this speaks volumes of the APC government. Recall that the US officials had said that more Nigerian politicians may be included on the visa ban list after the Edo governorship elections. “It is evident from the recent activities of Tinubu, that he is prepared to use all means to make APC win in the State. The desperation is obvious. “The US is watching his activities closely and they won’t hesitate to slam him with a visa ban if necessary. “It will be a big surprise if Edo voters will still go ahead and support APC come Saturday elections, because Oshiomhole has been found to be one of those undermining democracy in Nigeria, and also operating with impunity at the expense of the Nigerian people.

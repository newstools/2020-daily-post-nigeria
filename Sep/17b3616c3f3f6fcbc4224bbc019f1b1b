He noted that the unions were surprised to discover that he is now imposing Babaloja general of the state on the people rather than maintaining his stand on the said issue. “We appreciated the governor for allowing us to work during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. If you see the different unions present here today, you will see that we are the real authentic Traders. On this issue of Babaloja of the state, we can’t accept any imposition. Our own Babaloja is Alhaji Jimoh Akinremi. “Appointing Babaloja General of the state has a process which must be duly followed. All the marketers in the state have started the process by visiting the house of chiefs, secretariat Ibadan before we heard someone has been installed. “We are talking about Babaloja of Oyo state and not Ibadan land. If the government ratifies the imposed Babaloja, we are going to ensure that all zones have their Babaloja General.”

Manchester United failed to sign Chelsea’s new man, Kai Havertz, because they wanted to focus on trying to land Jadon Sancho instead, according to the Manchester Evening News. The Red Devils refused to pay Bayer Leverkusen’s asking price and decided to try and sign Sancho from Borussia Dortmund. However, United are also yet to pay Dortmund’s £108m asking price and Sancho looks set to stay with the Bundesliga side. Havertz trained with his new Chelsea team-mates for the first time on Saturday morning, after sealing a record £89million move on Friday. The 21-year-old attacking midfielder joins Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Xavier Mbuyamba, Ben Chilwell, Malang Sarr and Thiago Silva in signing for the Blues this summer, taking the club’s spending to approximately £230m.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has applauded the United States of America for imposing a visa ban on some Nigerian politicians, accused of undermining the electoral process in Nigeria. This comes ahead of the September and October 2020 governorship polls in Edo and Ondo States respectively. The Department of State’s spokesman, Morgan Ortagus, disclosed this in a statement on Monday. The opposition said the ban was “an unambiguous caution” to former chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, the APC governorship candidates in Edo, Osagie Ize-Iyamu and his Ondo counterpart, Rotimi Akeredolu.” This was contained in a statement signed by PDP’s spokeman, Kola Ologbondiyan, on Tuesday. Ologbondiyan urged the US government to extend the ban to family members and assets of the affected politicians. PDP also called on the European Union (EU) as well as the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia, to also impose similar sanctions on electoral violators. The statement added that “The US ban is, therefore, firm support to our stiff resistance to plots by Oshiomhole and Ize-Iyamu, who have been overheating the polity in Edo state with serial attacks on other political parties while assembling thugs, cultists, fake policemen as well as their ‘tigers and lions’ who they publicly instructed to invade polling centres to unleash violence and undermine the electoral process. “In Ondo, Nigerians are already aware of how the self-confessed APC militant and former APC chairman in the state, Isaac Kekemeke, boasted that the APC will use violence to rig the October 10 election and that Governor Akeredolu was behind the violent political attacks rocking the state.”

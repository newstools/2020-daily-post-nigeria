A former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Bode George, has warned against the hike in electricity tariff and pump price of petrol. Bode George warned that President Muhammadu Buhari should reverse the increment because Nigeria was at the verge of collapse. He stated that Nigerians were yet to recover from the effect of COVID-19, hence the new tariff and price should be reversed. Bode George spoke on Tuesday when the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, aspirants for the Lagos East Senatorial district and Kosofe 2 State Constituency paid him a courtesy call. He stressed that the government has inflicted the greatest pain on Nigerians through the new hike in electricity tariff and price of petrol. According to Bode George: “There is hunger in the land; Nigeria is on the verge of collapse. The President has only one opportunity to rewrite his name in the golden pages of history. “They should revisit the decision, it is inhuman, unacceptable and going to add too much pain both to the rich and poor. “Who will not be at pain now with an increase in petrol and electricity? The immediate thing is that all industries will hike their products despite the fact that so many people have lost their jobs as a result of COVID-19. “The President should look at faces and tell those people behind this increment to stop.” The PDP chieftain also lamented over the current system of government in Nigeria. Stressing that the current system is not working, Bode George insisted that the current structure was that of military in nature.

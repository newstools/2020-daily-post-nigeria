Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has reacted to the reports of two separate attacks launched by yet to be identified persons against security agents and dispossessed them of their arms. The Governor in a statement released by the Honorable Commissioner for Information, Chief John Okiyi Kalu directed security agencies in the state to ensure that perpetrators of the attacks are apprehended immediately and the arms recovered. He also urged individuals and corporate organisations in the state to maintain high level of vigilance and take necessary measures to protect themselves, their customers and establishments, in order to complement the efforts of government and security agents. “Parents and guardians are also advised to warn and monitor their children to ensure they do not engage in criminal activities as the long arm of the law will surely catch up with anyone involved in criminal activities. ”All suspicious movements and persons should be promptly reported to the Abia State Police Command via this number; 0803 541 5405. ”Also, law abiding citizens are advised to go about their normal duties as Government has activated all necessary security protocols to protect lives and property of all citizens and residents,” he said.

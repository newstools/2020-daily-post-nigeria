Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has dragged the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu and former National Chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole to the US over the incarceration of Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State in Edo State. DAILY POST reported last night that the PDP claimed that the hotel where Governor Wike is lodging in Benin, the capital of Edo State, was surrounded by over 300 policemen. The allegation was made by the party’s chairman in Rivers state, Akawor Desmond. Wike is in the state to monitor the polls, as he was appointed Chairman of the PDP National Campaign Council for the Edo Governorship election, a position Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State holds for the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Rivers State Governor, Wike’s movement has reportedly been restricted to his hotel room in Edo State. And in his letter to the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, Bamgbose, a senior lawyer, said, “We are convinced that this unlawful restriction of Wike’s movement could have been masterminded by Oshiomhole, who was recently slammed with US Visa ban and Bola Tinubu, who recently has shown untoward aggressiveness in winning the election at all cost. “Your immediate intervention is required to save the situation. The Nigeria Police has not issued any information to justify Wike’s incarceration. It’s obvious that the duo, Tinubu and Oshiomhole have plans to rig the election at all cost in favour of the APC governorship candidate. “Governor Wike has the constitutional right of movement, which has been restricted by IGP, very likely via the instruction or knowledge of the Presidency. “This is nothing but impunity of the highest order. We cannot continue like this in Nigeria. We covet your immediate intervention to get Governor Wike out of unlawful imprisonment. We shall appreciate this enormously.”

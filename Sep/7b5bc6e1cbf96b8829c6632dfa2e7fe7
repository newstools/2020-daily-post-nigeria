Governor Willie Obiano of Anambra State has said that Anambra International Cargo Airport, located at Umueri will be commissioned in April 2021. Governor Obiano made this disclosure on Thursday, while performing the official groundbreaking ceremony of Anambra Luxury Place Estate, a public, private partnership project between Anambra state government and Rotech Energy Services Limited in Nkwelle, near Onitsha. “The Anambra international cargo airport will be inaugurated in April next year. It will be one of the best in the country,” Obiano said. He encouraged Anambra people to invest in the luxury estate, saying that the Nkwelle G.R.A project, which he said is just 10 minutes drive from the airport. “The airport is just 10 minutes drive from here, and a few kilometres from Onitsha town. Itis strategically located and is a worthwhile investment.” He praised the promoter of the project, Chief Austin Oguejiofor who is the Chairman/Chief Executive of Rotech Energy Services Ltd for heeding to his government’s ‘Aku Luo Uno’ call and urged Ndi Anambra who have created wealth outside the state to also consider investing some of their wealth in Anambra state. Opposition politicians had dismissed the airport project in 2017 as a campaign gimmick by the governor to win reelection. Former aviation minister, Femi Fani-Kayode, who inspected the project weeks back confessed that work is at an advanced stage, and that the airport will be one of the best in the country when completed.

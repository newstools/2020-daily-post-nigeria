Disqualified BBNaija ‘Double Wahala’ housemate, Tacha, has thrown shades at organisers of Big Brother. Tacha on Thursday called out those tagging and sending messages to vote for Lockdown housemates up for eviction. Tacha, who was disqualified from BBNaija 2019 edition, said votes do not count and advised Nigerians to learn. She said this in a video shared on her Instagram page. According to her, “Stop texting me to vote for your favorite housemate, like your vote counts anyway. “Nigerians you would never learn, does your vote count. So please let me be.” Tacha had a huge fan-base while on the reality show but got disqualified after she got into a fight with the winner of BBNaija 2019 Mercy Eke.

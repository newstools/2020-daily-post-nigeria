The president of Apex Ngwa Socio-Political Organization, Ngwa Patriots Forum, Chief Uzoma Ihuka, says Governor Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State has done tremendously well in ensuring political stability in the state. Chief Ihuka, who was answering questions from newsmen in Umuahia earlier today, said it will be on record that the Governor is finishing his eight years tenure with the same Deputy. He also noted that the Governor is laying a good foundation for the growth of the state pointing out that he has given identity and restored confidence in Aba producers through his Made-in-Aba campaign which has made the demand for Aba products far exceed current supply. Chief Ihuka disclosed that for Abia to be ranked among the top five states in Nigeria in the Ease of Doing Business index is courtesy of the good leadership the Governor has brought to bear upon the state. He further expressed satisfaction that the Governor has broken every record in infrastructural development, especially, in constructing quality roads with drainages that will stand the test of time. Chief Ihuka revealed that the perennial flooding at Ama Ikonne is now a thing of the past while oil palm has been revolutionized, especially, with the planting of four million Tenera oil palm seedlings in the state. He averred that the Governor will be remembered, even, by generations unborn. The Ngwa Patriots Forum chieftain used the occasion to call on the media to change their pattern of reporting the state but look inward to see the positive revolution going on in all parts of the stateâ€™s economy.

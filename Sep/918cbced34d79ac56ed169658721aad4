Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has finally returned to the club’s pre-season training ahead of the 2020/21 season. Barcelona disclosed this known in a post via the club’s official Twitter handle on Monday. Messi now wants to reintegrate himself into the team following his failed attempt to leave Barcelona this summer. The Argentine was seen driving into the Ciutat Esportiva in Sant Joan Despi at just after 4:00 pm on Monday, where he is expected to take part in training for the first time under new manager, Ronald Koeman.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-837822" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mesii.jpg" alt="" width="620" height="330" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mesii.jpg 620w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mesii-300x160.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 620px) 100vw, 620px"> The 33-year-old said last Friday that he would continue to give his best for the Blaugrana, despite admitting defeat in his bid to depart the Catalan club for free.

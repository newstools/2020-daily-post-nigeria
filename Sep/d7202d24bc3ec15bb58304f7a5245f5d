Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted his team deserved to lose against Crystal Palace. The Red Devils began their Premier League campaign with a 3-1 home defeat. Palace took the lead through Andros Townsend, before Wilfried Zaha doubled their advantage from the penalty spot. New boy Donny van de Beek pulled one back, but Zaha netted again for Roy Hodgson’s men. Solskjaer did not make excuses for his men, after United suffered only their third opening-day home defeat in the Premier League era. “You could see that they came flying out of the traps. You could see the difference between their prep with four friendlies and this is their third game this season whereas this is only our first game. We had one friendly last week but I think it showed. We were way short. “You could see the physicality here this evening. They were sharper than us, they were stronger than us and we’ve got to catch up quickly. We can’t wait to have a normal pre-season and our next game [against Luton Town in the Carabao Cup, live on Sky Sports] is already on Tuesday,” he told Sky Sports.

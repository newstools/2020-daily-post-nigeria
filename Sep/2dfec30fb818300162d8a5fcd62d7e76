Trickytee has revealed that he warned Erica that she was going to regret her actions during her ranting on Saturday. Trickytee also insisted that Erica’s predicament was caused by excess alcohol, she took during the Saturday night party. He said the alcohol help stirred up the grudges Erica had against Laycon and Prince and made her go weird. “As for the disqualification of Erica…I feel…I know I tried as a friend to calm her down. “I tried but I feel that everybody in the house had taken the position I took, I assure you it wouldn’t have degenerated to that point. “I can remember saying that when she started that day that, ‘see, you’ll regret this thing tomorrow, try to go and sleep’ because I knew that it was the alcohol that was bringing all those things out. “In my own opinion when you drink too much alcohol has a way to amplify some things inside of you.”

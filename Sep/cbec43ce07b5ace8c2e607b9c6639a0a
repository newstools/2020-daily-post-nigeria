A 38-year-old pastor, Idowu Samson, was on Monday arraigned before an Iseyin Chief Magistrate’s Court for allegedly defiling a nine-year-old girl. Shaib Shedrack, the prosecutor, told the court that the defendant, who operates a church in the Iseyin metropolis, committed the crime on August 19. “He inserted his finger into the private part of the victim with the claims that he wanted to cast out demons in her. He defiled and had carnal knowledge of the young girl before people could notice or get to the church. “He lied to the parents of the young girl that he would help in washing her off the devil and demons and asked them to go home before he committed the offence”, NAN quoted the police officer as saying. The offence was contrary to and punishable under Section 210 (A) Cap C38, Laws of the Federation 2004. Samson pleaded not guilty to the two count-charge of defilement and impersonation. Ade Bamgbose, the defence counsel, pleaded for bail for his client in a liberal term. Chief Magistrate Maaruff Mudashiru ordered that the accused person be remanded in prison custody pending the ruling on the bail application. The case was adjourned until October 12.

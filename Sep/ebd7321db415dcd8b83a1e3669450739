Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Ka3na, has reacted to Lucy’s attitude at this week’s wager task. Lucy had broken down in tears because housemates were allegedly mocking Ka3na during rehearsals. Biggie had given housemates a task to mimick and pay tribute to evicted housemates in the show. However, Lucy refused to participate in the task because housemates were not considering her suggestions. When approached by Dorathy, Lucy broke down in tears. According to her, housemates were disrespectful while mimicking Ka3na. Reacting, Ka3na on her Instagram page said she has found a sister in Lucy. “All my life, I have had my big sister as my only friend. Reason because I hate being judged and gossiped about. “I went for BBN with one intention of promoting my brand but I got lucky. God blessed me with a true friend I can proudly and openly call my sister. Lucy thank you for loving me right back. I love you.”

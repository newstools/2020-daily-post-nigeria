The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has directed nationwide registration and capturing of all retired police officers for the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS).

The registration and capturing would be in three batches and conducted at police area commands nationwide. The ex-officers were advised to visit the command closest to them with their National Identity Number, letter of retirement and retiree’s identity cards. The registration will be held from September 7 to September 23. North-West, North-East and part of North-Central, Federal Capital Territory and Nasarawa – September 7 to September 9.

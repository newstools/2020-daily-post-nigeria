Arsenal striker, Alexandre Lacazette, on Saturday afternoon made Premier League history after scoring in his side’s 3-0 victory against Fulham. Lacazette netted Arsenal’s first goal in the ninth minute against Fulham at Craven Cottage. Gabriel and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang then scored two goals for Mikel Arteta’s side in the second half to give the Emirates club all three points against the host. However, Lacazette’s goal against Fulham means the France international has now become the first player to open the scoring in a Premier League campaign twice, according to Opta Joe. The 29-year-old had previously become the first player to score in a Premier League season in 2017-18, when he scored within two minutes during his side’s opener against Leicester City, on his debut in the competition. Lacazette was recently linked with a move away from Arsenal to Juventus and Atletico Madrid respectively this summer, but he insisted on Friday that he wanted to remain at the North London club. The forward will now hope to continue his brilliant form for Arteta’s side when they host West Ham United in their next fixture on September 19.

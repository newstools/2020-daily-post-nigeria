The Commissioner of Police in RIvers State, Joseph Mukan has disclosed that kidnapping, car theft and child trafficking syndicates are major prevailing crimes in the State. CP Mukan made the revelation while showcasing the achievements of the command and parading suspects arrested during operations in different parts of the State. He added that the command is not also relenting in tackling the issue. Some of the suspects paraded included those involved in various offences: child trafficking, kidnapping, as well as the suspects involved in the kidnap and murder of the Divisional Crime Officer Afam Division, Late DCO Moses Egbede. Mukan said men of the anti-kidnapping unit led by the commander, in a covert operation arrested one 22-year-old, Idoroyen Friday Ogale in Eleme LGA who on interrogation confessed to have kidnapped the now Late Officer along with others. Among the suspects paraded are also Chinedu Nwachukwu who allegedly killed a forty-year-old woman and stole her three-months-old baby and Mary Ishmael, a 60-year-old woman who allegedly bought the baby at the sum of N350,000 and among others. “Operatives of the Anti-Kidnapping Unit again arrested one Temple Emmanuel ‘m’ 27yrs of Ngo Community in Andoni LGA, where they recovered forty pieces of one Thousand Fake Naira Notes. “You will no doubt agree with me that since my assumption of duty in the State, I have worked assiduously with my Team to neutralize all criminal activities/elements and stabilized the Command; which is the reason for the fragile peace we enjoy today in Rivers State. This of course, is due largely to the rejigging and re-strategizing mechanisms I put in place that paid off handsomely.

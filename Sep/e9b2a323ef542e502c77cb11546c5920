Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Laycon has advised Vee on her relationship with Neo outside the house. Vee and Neo have had breakups, and quarrels over food despite being lovers in the house. This has posed a threat to their relationship and has given Vee a reason to think if they are compatible. Speaking to Laycon on Friday night, she asked what he thinks will happen to her and Neo after the house. Laycon advised her not to overthink it, saying they would know if their love was real after they have sex. Laycon said: “After you have sex with Neo which I know you both can’t wait to do, you’ll know if the relationship will work or not. “Don’t beat yourself up right now about it.”

The United States President, Donald Trump has again asked Joe Biden to take a drug test. The American leader made the call on Sunday ahead of their debate. The first presidential debate will be held on Tuesday in Cleveland. “I will be strongly demanding a Drug Test of Sleepy Joe Biden prior to, or after, the Debate on Tuesday night. Naturally, I will agree to take one also. His Debate performances have been record-setting UNEVEN, to put it mildly. Only drugs could have caused this discrepancy???,” he tweeted. Just over a fortnight ago, Trump alleged that the Democratic presidential candidate takes performance-enhancing drugs for public speeches. Despite repeated allegations about Biden’s mental fitness for the presidency, the president has not provided any evidence. Trump and Biden will go head to head at the polls on November 3.

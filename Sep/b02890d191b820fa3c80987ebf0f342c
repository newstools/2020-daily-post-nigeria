Former Leeds United star, Vinne Jones, has urged Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, to join the Whites this summer. Messi looks set to leave Barcelona after he told the club last week to activate a clause in his contract that would allow him to leave Camp Nou for free. The 33-year-old Argentine, who still has 12 months in his current contract with Barcelona, has drawn interest from Manchester City, Manchester United, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan in the past few days. But Jones wants the Barca number 10 to join the Premier League newcomers this summer. Writing in his column for Easy Odd, Jones said: “I’m making one last plea for Lionel Messi to join Leeds. “Come on, Lionel. You know it makes sense. Bielsa’s getting things together at Elland Road and you know his reputation as a coach – he’s already been linked with Barcelona as a possible replacement for Quique Setien. So you a little genius, come to Yorkshire! “He’ll be in good company. Leeds have signed Robin Koch from Freiburg, a top German defender, as well as Valencia striker Rodrigo – so Messi will know all about him, too. And anyway, I’d have Leeds over Barcelona as a city any day.”

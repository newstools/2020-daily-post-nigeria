Tottenham Hotspur boss, Jose Mourinho, has taken a swipe at Nigeria striker, Victor Osimhen, for rejecting a move to the club because he does not want to compete with Harry Kane for a spot, SportingLife reports. Osimhen eventually joined Napoli from Lille this summer. But his agent, Ariyo Igbayiola, had admitted that he held talks with Mourinho before completing the transfer to Serie A. Igbayiola says he informed Spurs that Osimhen will only join if Kane leaves the club. However, speaking on the lack of attacking options in his squad, Mourinho said he will not sign a striker who is afraid to compete with Kane. “The point is not me convincing the striker, it’s the striker convincing me. “And if the striker is afraid to come to Tottenham and the striker is afraid of competition, then I don’t want the striker. “If he says I don’t want to go because I don’t want to be in a squad where we have Harry Kane and Sonny, (Erik) Lamela, Lucas (Moura), I don’t want to go to that squad, then goodbye,” Mourinho said.

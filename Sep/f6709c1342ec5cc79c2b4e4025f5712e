Former Liverpool star, Mark Lawrenson, has predicted that Arsenal will beat West Ham United 2-1 in today’s Premier League fixture at Emirates Stadium. Lawrenson also backed Manchester United to secure a 2-0 win against Crystal Palace at Old Trafford. Providing his prediction, Lawrenson told BBC Sport: “Arsenal have been top of the league all week, which doesn’t mean very much after only one game, apart from the confidence you get from knowing you’ve made a really good start. “West Ham, on the other hand, were wishy-washy in their defeat by Newcastle, and they always seem to be fighting fires off the pitch. “How Arsenal gets on this time could tell us a lot about how much progress they have made in the past six months. Arsenal 2, West Ham 1.” Commenting on the Man United vs Palace game, Lawrenson said: “This’s Manchester United’s first game back, while Crystal Palace started well, with a good win over Southampton. “With Michy Batshuayi on loan from Chelsea, the Eagles look like they’ve got a few avenues for goals, which has been a problem for them in the past. “I still do not think they will get anything at Old Trafford, though. Man United 2, Crystal Palace 0.” The kick-off time for Arsenal vs West Ham is 8 pm, while that of Man United vs Crystal Palace is 5:30 pm.

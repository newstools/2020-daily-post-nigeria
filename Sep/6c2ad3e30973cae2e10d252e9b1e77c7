The Police in Delta State have arrested three suspected child traffickers. They also recovered a 2-month-old baby allegedly sold out by the traffickers in Igbodo Community, Aniocha North Local Government Area. The suspects were arrested following information by one Kelvi Anyia of Qushi Quarters in Onicha-Ugbo Community that his twenty-year-old girlfriend, Ogechi Godwin gave birth to a baby boy and sold the child out to an unknown person and lied to him that the baby died and was thrown into a pit toilet. Swiftly, the police swung into action, arrested and interrogated the suspect who confessed that she sold her baby with the consent of one Nkiru to one Ifeoma at Umunede Community.

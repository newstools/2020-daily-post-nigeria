A member of the Interim Management Committee of the Niger-Delta Development Commission, NDDC, Caroline Naagbo, has commended security agencies for foiling an “assassination attempt on her life”. Nagbo told newsmen in Port Harcourt that the incident happened in Ozuoba, a community in Obio-Akpor Local government area of Rivers state. The NDDC IMC member narrated that she narrowly escaped the assassination after she attended a church service in Ozuoba. Special Adviser to Naagbo on Technical and Youth Matters, Sogbeye Eli, in an interview told newsmen that, “the attempted assassination was aborted due to the swift reaction of security agencies, following a distress calls made to the Police and the Department of State Services (DSS).” Without going into specifics of the attempt on her life, Caroline Naagbo thanked her colleague in the IMC and acting Executive Director, Finance and Administration, Effiong Akwa, for his prompt response to the rescue effort. While noting that criminal elements terrorizing the State must be flushed out to secure the lives of law-abiding citizens, Nagbo said she had already reported the incident to Police, just as she called on, “the Commissioner of Police, Joseph Mukan, and other security agencies operating in Rivers to intensify efforts in tracking down those who were after her life. “Criminal elements should be contained to stop scaring away investors in the oil and gas sector, who are providing gainful employment to the teeming graduate and skilled population in Rivers.” The NDDC has been embroiled in controversies caused by allegations of misappropriation of funds. While the Federal Government Executive Council has sanctioned an audit of the NDDC, the National Assembly has also launched a probe into the activities of the commission.

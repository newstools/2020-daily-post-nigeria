Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, Boss Mustapha, has urged religious leaders to advise their congregations to wear facemask. Mustapha gave the advice, during Mondays’ PTF media briefing on COVID-19 on Monday in Abuja. Expressing displeasure over Nigerians moving about without facemask, Boss Mustapha said that religious leaders and traditional rulers have a lot to do to curb the spread of the disease. According to him, the best Nigerians can do is to adhere to the non-pharmaceutical interventions which includes wearing face mask, observing social distancing and staying away from large crowd. “It is sad when people gather and they do not think it is appropriate to wear mask. What we can do is to continue to appeal to our people that COVID-19 is still alive, it has not gone on any vacation. “People are dying on a daily basis from COVID-19 and as we expect vaccines to show up on the horizon, the only vaccine we have in our hand now let us apply it,” he said.

A housewife, Ladidi Abbas, on Tuesday, dragged her husband, Shehu Abbas to a Sharia Court sitting in Magajin Gari, Kaduna, seeking divorce over alleged battery. Abbas, a resident of Rigasa, Kaduna, said her husband usually beats her over any misunderstanding. According to her, she was hospitalized for 13 days the last time he abused her. “He usually beats me in front of our children, the last time he beats me, I was hospitalized for 13 days,” Abbas said. She prayed the court to dissolve the marriage and grant her custody of their children. The defendant, Abbas, a retired journalist who also resides at Rigasa, denied the allegation. “It is now I love my wife the most,” he said, and prayed the court to grant him time to resolve their marital problems. The judge, Murtala Nasir, after listening to both parties, directed the complainant to bring witnesses to testify on her allegation of battery. He then adjourned the case to September 10, for further hearing, NAN reports.

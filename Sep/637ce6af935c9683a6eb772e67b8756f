Paris Saint-Germain are in negotiations with Arsenal over a £30million move for Hector Bellerin, according to SportsMail. The Gunners do not want to lose the 25-year-old, but could be tempted to sell if they get a substantial offer. Juventus and Bayern Munich are also keen on Bellerin, but PSG have made the first move. Bellerin is under contract until 2023, but the Spaniard is open to a new challenge. PSG have been long term admirers and persistent in their pursuit. They are offering £25m with a further £5m in add-ons. Arsenal value him higher than that and talks will continue. Bellerin’s departure could see Ainsley Maitland-Niles remain at the Emirates.

Big Brother Naija, lockdown housemate, Prince on Thursday demanded that Biggie be lenient with fines. His statement came after Biggie issued Nengi a fine for microphone infringement. Speaking during his diary session, Prince begged Biggie to be lenient with fines adding that fines could lead to the housemates losing their wager which will dampen the mood in the house. “No bad blood, no fights, good attitude to tasks among housemates and HOH has been amazing “I’ll like to plead that you be lenient over the infringements. The only person that has incurred an infringement this week is Nengi and it’s surprising. “If we lose the wager Nengi will be responsible but the house will still rally around her, it’s a common issue for everyone.”

New Chelsea signing, Kai Havertz, has said that the club’s manager, Frank Lampard, was the person that convinced him to join the Blues from Bayer Leverkusen. Havertz said that Lampard won him over to Chelsea because he loved him as a player and watched him very often during his playing days. DAILY POST had reported that Havertz officially joined Chelsea from Leverkusen on a five-year deal on Friday. Havertz, 21, joins Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Malang Sarr, Thiago Silva, and Ben Chilwell as Lampard’s new signings this summer. “Of course, he [Frank Lampard] had a big impact on my decision because I loved him as a player and watched him very often,” Havertz told Chelsea’s official website. “I think I can learn from him as a manager as well and I think he’s a very humble person. “He’s a great guy, and I cannot wait to play with him and learn from him. “He was very offensive like me, and he loved to score goals. I love to score goals as well, so he’ll help me a lot in my position and also maybe on the things I can improve. “I can’t wait to work with him.”

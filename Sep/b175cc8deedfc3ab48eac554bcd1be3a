The Presiding Priest, Emmanuel Baptist Church, Abraka in Ethiope-East Local Government Area of Delta State, Rev. Onoriode Oghenerhoro on Sunday urged religious leaders in the country to rise up and kick against the Companies and Allied Matters Act of 2020 and ensure that it does not see the light of the day. The Cleric made the call during a chat with our correspondent while marking his 10th-year Appreciation Service in the Church. While noting that a Muslim might be appointed to head the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, Rev. Oghenerhoro expressed fears that things will become tough for Christians if the CAMA law is allowed to stay. He said”Well, on my own, our fathers, the fathers of faith should fight and ensure that the law does not come to be because, the bottom line is that, tomorrow a Muslim is going to head that Committee which will make things tough for Christians. “So, right now, all our fathers of faith should do their best to stand against it.” It would be recalled that President Muhammadu Buhari recently signed into law the Companies and Allied Matters Act, CAMA 2020. There have been agitations against the law from religious groups particularly from the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, and the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, PFN and many others.

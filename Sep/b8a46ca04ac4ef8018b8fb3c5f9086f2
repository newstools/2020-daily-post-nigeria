Goodluck Jonathan, former President of Nigeria, on Sunday, congratulated the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki over his reelection. Jonathan urged Obaseki to set aside partisan politics while governing the state for the good of all. In a series of tweets, the former president commended the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for conducting a free and fair election in the state. Jonathan wrote: “I congratulate His Excellency @GovernorObaseki on his re-election as Edo State Governor. I also congratulate @inecnigeria for overseeing a process that allowed the votes of the good people of Edo to count. “Democracy can only be consolidated to promote good governance in our nation and continent when our elections become credible, transparent and truly represent the wish of the voters. Through their ballot papers, Edo people have spoken in favour of Governor Obaseki. He should therefore rise above partisan politics and govern for the good of all.

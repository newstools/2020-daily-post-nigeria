The Ogun Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) says 217 people died in 547 road traffic crashes from January to August in the state. The state Sector Commander, Mr Ahmed Umar, disclosed this during the flag-off of the last quarter of the year “Ember months’’ campaign in the state on Tuesday in Abeokuta. Umar explained that the command rescued over 1,338 persons in different motor traffic accidents during the period under review. According to him, the high traffic on Lagos -Sagamu, Sagamu-Ijebu Ode-Ajebandele and other expressways in the state made the state prone to a high record of crashes and injuries. “Economic and social activities increase during Ember months, these activities make the roads busier and more prone to crashes and gridlock. “FRSC’s Ember months operation is therefore aimed at minimising crashes and gridlocks along major corridors in the country,” he said. The sector commander said that the command would continue to engage the leadership of various transport unions to ensure compliance with traffic regulations and COVID -19 protocols, NAN reports.

Atletico Madrid are in talks with Arsenal over a loan deal for Lucas Torreira. Italian transfer expert, Fabrizio Romano, confirmed this via a tweet on Sunday night. According to him, the Gunners want a permanent deal for Torreira, so they can try again for their midfield targets this summer, which includes Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey. Apart from Partey, Mikel Arteta is also very keen on Lyon’s playmaker, Houssen Aouar. “Atlético Madrid are also in talks with Arsenal to sign Torreira on loan with buy option. “Arsenal want to sell him on a permanent deal to try again for Thomas or Aouar.
Torreira is desperate to leave. But Atléti need to sell before signing new players,” Romano wrote.

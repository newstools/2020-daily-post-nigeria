The candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Edo Governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, on Saturday, voted at Ugboko Ward 4, unit 26, Orhionmwon Local Government Council of the state. NAN reports that Ize-Iyamu joined the queue at his polling unit at Iguododo Primary School at about 9:20 a.m and voted in less than 10 minutes. He commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the peaceful and smooth electoral process. “The process is good and going on smoothly; there is no thuggery and violence, the place is peaceful and calm. I am happy that INEC has a thermometer to check temperature and they also give out face masks to our people.” The candidate said he had not been able to get information about the conduct of the election across the state due to the poor network at his voting community. Ize-Iyamu also expressed optimism that he would emerge victorious in the election. “I am confident of victory across the 18 LGAs of the state,” he declared.

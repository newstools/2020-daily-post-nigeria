Former Barcelona star, Rivaldo, has insisted the club’s fans will give captain, Lionel Messi a heroic reception if he ends up staying at Camp Nou amid interest from Manchester City. Messi handed in a transfer request last week as he pushed for a move to join Pep Guardiola’s Man City. Messi’s father and agent, Jorge, met with Barcelona’s senior officials on Wednesday over the player’s future at the club and more talks are planned. But Rivaldo believes that the Barcelona faithful would forgive Messi due to his qualities as a player. “Negotiations are continuing between Lionel Messi and Barcelona, as the player and club try to reach an agreement about his future,” Rivaldo told Betfair. “Blaugrana fans still have lots of love for him and know that he’s a legendary player who made and can still make the difference at the club, so things can still end up nicely. “But if he stays at the club, I am not imagining a scenario of fans booing him at the Camp Nou or anything similar, not at all. “He has taken responsibility for the team for too long and is probably tired of the pressure.”

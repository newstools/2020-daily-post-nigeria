Throwing more lights of the T Pumpy Kiddies Estate Splash, Mr. Akintayo said the company is not unaware of the law of the land, which forbids underage from owning a landed property, but this is achievable through the parents. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-836552 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0002-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="494" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0002-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0002.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"> “I know some people would ask, how possible it is because the law forbids underage from owing a landed property, but that is not an issue, the parents would sign on behalf of the child. By the time the child turns 18, the land automatically becomes his or hers. If you recall that when we signed Oreofeoluwa Lawal-Babalola of the Mummy Calm Down fame; as one of our ambassadors, it was the mother that signed on his behalf. So, with this, even a day old child can own a land through their parents.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-836553 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0018.jpg" alt="" width="907" height="605" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0018.jpg 907w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0018-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px"> On the build yourself promo, Mr. Adaralegbe said, “Build Your Self is a package that allow the subscriber to buy our land, build yourself and the house is all yours. Note that all the lands come with certified Certificates of Occupancy.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-836554 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0006.jpg" alt="" width="621" height="878" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0006.jpg 621w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0006-212x300.jpg 212w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px"> Speaking further, the MD/CEO said the only requirement needed before partaking in the ongoing Rent to Own promo is that one must have a job and must be citizen of Nigeria. “This package will be beneficial to all classes of income/salary earners. ‘Rent to Own’ package is available at our newly-acquired locations across Kyami, Life Camp, Katampe, Jabi, Jahi, Wasa, Kuje, all in Abuja with C-of-Os. “This offer is expected to last from now till the end of the year.” The T-Pumpy Concept team have decades of providing industry-acclaimed off-site home designs and constructions. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-836555 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0038-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="494" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0038-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0038-300x200.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0038.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"> Whether you’re interested in a manufactured home or an innovative modular design, the T-Pumpy Concept team continues to deliver what home buyers are looking for in their new homes along with the quality construction they expect and deserve. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-836556 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0021.jpg" alt="" width="907" height="605" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0021.jpg 907w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200903-WA0021-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px"> Corporate Office address: No. 12, Monrovia Street, Off Aminu Kano Crescent, Wuse II district, Abuja, Annex House 23, (F) Road, Beside RCCG Resurrection Parish, FHA Lugbe, Abuja.

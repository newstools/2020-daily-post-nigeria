Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has insisted that Liverpool’s new signing, Thiago Alcantara, is an absolute world-class midfielder. Thiago joined Liverpool on a four-year deal from Bayern Munich on Saturday for £20m. Speaking on the development before Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Liverpool on Sunday evening, Lampard said as quoted by Metro UK: “He is an incredible player. “As you say we saw him first-hand quality on the pitch, personality on the pitch and off the pitch. “The quotes from Hansi Flick this week have been talking about him on both fronts and when you hear that from their manager, who has just such success with him at the centre of the team, I think it speaks for itself. “He’s an absolute world-class midfielder in the modern day.” Thiago won multiple La Liga, Bundesliga and Champions League titles during his time at Bayern Munich and Barcelona respectively.

Arsenal have announced that Mikel Arteta’s job title has changed from head coach to first-team manager. This was confirmed in a club statement posted on the official website on Thursday night. “Right from the day he walked through the door, he was doing much more than being our head coach. “So we’re going to be changing his job title going forward. He’ll move from head coach to be the first-team manager. That’s recognition of what he’s been doing from the day he walked in the door, but also where we see his capabilities,” part of the statement read. Arteta replaced Unai Emery in December 2019. The Spaniard ended a turbulent campaign for the Gunners with silverware, as they beat Chelsea 2-1 in the FA Cup final. Arsenal also defeated Liverpool to lift the Community Shield last month.

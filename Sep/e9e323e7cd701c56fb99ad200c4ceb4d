The Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress and a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Obadiah Mailafiya has again been invited by the Directorate of State Services (DSS). DAILY POST recalls that it is the third time that the DSS is inviting Mr. Mailafiya over comments he made on radio, concerning Boko Haram. Mailafiya had alleged that a repentant bandit told him that a serving northern governor was a commander of the terrorist group. DAILY POST also recalls that, a few days after his second invitation by the DSS, the criminal investigation unit of the Police in Abuja, asked him to appear before it for criminal investigation. But, the former CBN Deputy Governor, refused to honour the invitation, instead filed a lawsuit at a Jos High Court seeking a restraining order against his invitation by the police. According to his Counsel, Yakubu Bawa, “My client has once again (for the 3rd time) been ordered to appear before the DSS at their Jos headquarters this coming Monday, 14th September, 2020, at 11.00 am”. He said no reason was given for his client’s invitation by the DSS.

Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano on Friday, presented 130 vehicles to traditional rulers in the state despite long-running controversy between the governor and some monarchs. The presentation is also coming weeks after a businessman, Arthur Eze allegedly presented 12 SUVs to 12 traditional rulers who were suspended for joining him to Abuja to see President Muhammadu Buhari. Eze had also accused Obiano of mistreating traditional rulers in the state by refusing to give five percent of the state’s revenue to the traditional institution as had been agreed by the federal government. Obiano while handing over the vehicle at Dr Alex Ekwueme Square, Awka at the state capital, said it was to appreciate their efforts in entrenching development including the security of lives and properties at the grassroots. He also commended them for overseeing the successful execution of the N20 million community infrastructure project at their respective communities, assuring that his administration would continue to provide for the traditional institution. Also speaking, the Commissioner for Local Government, Community and Chieftaincy Affairs, Mr Greg Obi said the traditional rulers were the bedrock and foundation for government’s achievement in all areas of the economy. Responding on behalf of the monarchs, the Chairman, Anambra State Traditional Rulers Council and Obi of Onitsha, HRH Alfred Achebe tasked his colleagues on unity and loyalty to constituted authority, while pledging support of the traditional rulers to the government. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-836962 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FB_IMG_1599230798198.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="316" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FB_IMG_1599230798198.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FB_IMG_1599230798198-300x132.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

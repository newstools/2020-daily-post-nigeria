Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has insisted forward, Gareth Bale is still one of the best players in the world. Bale is set to return to Tottenham Hotspur from Real Madrid in a one-year loan deal. The Wales international arrived in London on Friday, along with Real Madrid teammate Sergio Reguilon, with both players ready to put pen to paper on deals with Tottenham. Bale returns to Spurs after seven years, while Reguilon joins on a permanent deal. Lampard believes the 31-year-old will be a huge asset for Jose Mourinho’s side. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday ahead of Chelsea’s Premier League clash with Liverpool on Sunday, Lampard said: “Gareth Bale is an incredible player, incredible individual talent, who we remember very well from his days at Tottenham. “We have also seen from afar the incredible success he’s had a Real Madrid and if he does come to Tottenham – and I keep seeing that it’s virtually going to happen soon – then I think he’s going to be a big addition to their squad, of course. “Of course, they’ve got very good individuals at Tottenham, and they are going to be a team that’s expected to challenge in and around the Champions League places and above. “They have fantastic individuals, and if they get Gareth Bale, then they add one for sure. He is one of the best players in the world, in my opinion, over the last four or five seasons.”

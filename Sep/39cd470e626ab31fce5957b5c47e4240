Spanish midfielder, Dani Ceballos, has said that he decided to rejoin Arsenal on a second successive loan spell and turn down offers from Real Madrid and other La Liga teams because he wants to win titles with the Gunners. Ceballos impressed in his first loan at Emirates last season after joining Arsenal from Real Madrid. “I’m very pleased to be back with Arsenal where I had such a good time last season,” the 24-year-old told Arsenal’s official website after his second loan was confirmed on Friday night. “I am very happy to have come back to a club where I feel important. He added: “It’s true that I had other options, such as staying at Real Madrid and going back to the Spanish league, where there were teams interested in me. “I spoke to the coach last season, before the FA Cup final, and told him that I wanted to stay at Arsenal and win titles. I would be really happy with what Mikel [Arteta] had built at the club since I came in. “I had a great time at this club last season, and there was never any doubt in my mind that I wanted to come back.”

The rematch between Dillian Whyte and Alexander Povetkin will take place on November 21, 2020. Whyte has revenge on his mind after the Russian produced a dramatic knockout win last month “I’m looking to do what I said I would the first time, and that’s beat Alexander Povetkin,” Whyte told Sky Sports. Povetkin said: “I’ve rested well, spent time with my family, and now that the date of the rematch is known, I will soon return to my training camp and prepare as thoroughly as I did for the first fight.” Last month’s defeat was Whyte’s first since Anthony Joshua put him down in 2015. It also ended an 11-fight winning streak and cost him the WBC mandatory status.

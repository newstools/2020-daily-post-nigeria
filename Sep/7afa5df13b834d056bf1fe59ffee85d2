National Universities Commission (NUC) has ordered schools to conclude arrangements for reopening. This followed federal government’s approval for resumption. NUC directed Vice Chancellors to ensure that resumption plans are in sync with Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) guidelines. The memo was signed by Chris Maiyaki, a Director in NUC Executive Secretary’s office. NUC told universities to expect visits for inspection of staff officers, lecture theatres, laboratories, libraries, accommodation, healthcare facilities, among others. “Universities must under no circumstances, violate the full cycle of the semester system, consistent with the NUC approved Benchmark Minimum Academic Standards (BMAS),” the letter warned. Schools are to also ensure strict compliance with other extant NUC quality assurance standards and guidelines.

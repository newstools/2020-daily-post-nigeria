The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, has ordered the restriction of vehicular movement in Edo State. The curfew starts 11:59pm on Friday and ends 6pm on Saturday. Police spokesman, Frank Mba, in a statement said this would ensure public order and safety during the governorship election. Mba also cited the need to prevent the movement of illicit arms, hard drugs and political thugs. The IGP enjoined citizens to go out en-masse and vote, assuring that security agencies have been sufficiently mobilized to provide a safe, secure and conducive environment. He told citizens to see the restriction as part of necessary sacrifices towards the enthronement of democracy. Adamu warned against any form of violence, snatching of ballot boxes, vote-buying, vote-selling, hate speeches, and other acts capable of compromising the electoral processes.

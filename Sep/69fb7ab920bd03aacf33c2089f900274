Gabriel Magalhaes has revealed that Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta and technical director, Edu, convinced him to join the club. The Gunners officially announced the Brazilian’s £27million switch from Lille on Tuesday after weeks of speculation. Magalhaes was the subject of interest from Manchester United, Everton and Napoli. But the 22-year-old was convinced to move to the Emirates, after speaking with Arteta and Edu. “[Edu and I] had several chats about Arsenal and the new project, we had many good conversations,” he told Arsenal Digital. “Then I had a call from the coach and that was very reassuring. “Having the coach himself calling you to say he wants you in his squad motivates you a lot. That is the very reason I am here today.”

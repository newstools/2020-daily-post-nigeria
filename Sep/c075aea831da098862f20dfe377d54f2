President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday met with the Caretaker Committee members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mai Mala Buni and Kano state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State, at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Ganduje was Chairman of the APC Campaign Committee for the just concluded Edo governorship election, which saw Governor Godwin Obaseki re-elected for a second term on Sunday. Obaseki polled 307,857 votes, while the APC’s candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu got a total of 223,622 votes. Although the meeting between Buhari, Buni and Ganduje was described as private, it may not be unconnected with the Edo gubernatorial election. Both Buni and Ganduje left the president’s office using a route to deliberately avoid State House reporters. Ganduje and his Imo State counterpart, Hope Uzodinma, had spent the weekend in Benin City, as they hoped to oversee the victory of the APC in the elections.

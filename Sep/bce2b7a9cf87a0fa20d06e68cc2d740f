The Chairman of the Ekiti Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Prof Femi Akinwumi has warned contractors handling the construction of the four public secondary schools recently established by the Fayemi administration that the September 30th deadline to complete work remains sacrosanct. Speaking during a meeting with the contractors handling the projects in Ado-Ekiti, the SUBEB boss assured of the boardâ€™s continued support towards ensuring the completion of the project on schedule. While stressing that the board would ensure proper supervision of the projects for strict compliance with specifications, Akinwumi urged the contractors to make sure that the deadline on the projects was met. The SUBEB boss who stressed the commitment of the Fayemi led administration to the provision of free qualitative basic education to all children of school age in the state said the four new secondary schools would, upon completion, improve access of students living in the outskirts of the State capital to secondary education. Speaking earlier, the Commissioner, Projects Management in the Board, Dr. Kayode Adeoye noted that though the COVID-19 lockdown initially slowed down construction work at the four schools, the contractors covered lost ground in the last few months as work had reached advanced stages on the projects. Also speaking, the new Permanent Secretary of SUBEB, Mr. Oluwadare Ajayi urged the contractors to note the observations and adhere strictly to the directives of Governor Fayemi during his recent visit to the project sites. Responding, representatives of the contractors pledged that they would deliver the projects as scheduled, saying that they had already commenced roofing, plastering, fixing of the doors and windows, electrification and plumbing works as well as the landscaping of the playground and environment of the new schools.

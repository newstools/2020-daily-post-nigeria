Heads of State and Governments of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), at the behest of their Chairman, President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana, may confer again to discuss outstanding grey areas in the Mali political situation, President Muhammadu Buhari has indicated. The President spoke after receiving a briefing at the State House, Abuja on Monday, from the ECOWAS Special Envoy to Mali, former Nigerian President, Dr Goodluck Jonathan. Mali has appointed a civilian as Interim President, who will stay in office for 18 months, and lead the country back to constitutional order, after the military had taken over power in the country. The move is part of the irreducible demands by the West African leaders before sanctions imposed on the country could be lifted. However, according to the Special Envoy, the military leaders are yet to satisfy ECOWAS demands of a full civilian as Vice President, and what his roles would be in government. That position is currently being held by a serving military officer, who was also one of the leaders of the take-over. President Buhari counseled the Special Envoy to present a formal report to the new ECOWAS Chairman, President Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana, “who will then write them officially to determine the next steps.” The President said with about two-thirds of Mali currently under occupation by terrorists, “the priority of the military should be to secure their country,” rather than hold on to power.

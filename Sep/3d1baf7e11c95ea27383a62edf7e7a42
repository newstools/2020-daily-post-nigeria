President Muhammadu Buhari has joined the academia, particularly members of staff of the University of Ibadan (UI) and Nigeria Economic Society (NES) in mourning the passing of Prof Femi Kayode. His reaction was contained in a statement on Monday by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina. Buhari commiserated with the family of the scholar, friends associates, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and government and people of Kogi State. He described the economist as an asset to Nigeria and the world. The Nigerian leader recalled the key role Kayode played in the structuring and operations of many development institutions. Buhari noted that his passion for learning marked him out early for academia. “His careful choice of research, writing and publishing on development issues, with interest in ameliorating poverty and encouraging growth by building human capacity further reflected his selflessness and kind heart”, he said. Buhari hailed Kayode’s contributions as the first doctoral graduate of the Department of Economics, UI; Head of Department of Economics; Pioneer Director of the Consultancy Services Unit; and Pioneer Coordinating Director, Centre for Resource Control & Management (CEREMAC). The President prayed that God will accept his soul and comfort the family.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has hit out at Jose Mourinho, after the Tottenham Hotspur boss criticized his side’s fixture scheduled ahead of their Carabao Cup tie. Spurs play the Blues on Tuesday, Maccabi Haifa in the Europa League on Thursday and Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday. Speaking after their 1-1 draw with Newcastle United on Sunday, Mourinho suggested he might have to name a weakened side against Chelsea. Responding to his former boss’ remarks, Lampard stated his belief that Spurs do not have things any more difficult than many other teams so far this season. When asked about it, he said: “Yeah, I mean, I know that, and I know it’s a busy time for Tottenham because of the Europa League. “It’s a busy time for us all. They had a free mid-week last week, we didn’t. “I know they have a busy week this week. But when I analyse Tottenham and know the squad they have, and analyse what might be a team that maybe didn’t play 90 minutes pretty much yesterday. “They have a fantastic squad, so I feel that any squad Jose will put out can be very strong. “I think we all know that the Carabao Cup, for teams like ourselves and Tottenham – who are challenging for the top four and Champions League, like we are – then the Carabao Cup does have its place and we certainly respect it and every tournament we go in we’ll try and win.”

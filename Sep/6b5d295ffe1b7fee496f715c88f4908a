AC Milan striker, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, on Monday night, made history in his side’s Serie A 2-0 victory against Bologna. Ibrahimovic scored both of Milan’s goals against Bologna at San Siro to give the host all three points against the Rossoblu. The 38-year-old’s brace against Bologna means the Swedish star has now scored in 23 consecutive seasons and in 4 separate decades since his debut in 1999. Speaking after the game, Ibrahimovic told Sky Sport Italia: “I am fine, I am working, this is the second official match. “We won, I could have scored more goals. If I was 20, I would have scored another two. I am like Benjamin Button, I was born old, and I die young.” Ibrahimovic re-joined AC Milan from LA Galaxy last January’s transfer window. He has played for 9 different clubs in his extraordinary career so far. The former Manchester United and Paris Saint-German star has played in Sweden, Holland, Italy, France, England and the USA. Ibrahimovic will now hope to lead Milan to victory when they face Crotone in their next Serie A fixture on Sunday.

Prophet T.B Joshua of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, SCOAN, has advised Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi against leaving Camp Nou amid interest from Manchester City. Barcelona is currently battling to keep Messi as the 33-year-old pushes for a free transfer to reunite with his former manager, Pep Guardiola, at Man City. Messi’s release clause will have to be paid if he is to leave Barcelona this summer. The Argentine captain believes he is no longer an employee of the Blaugrana, but the Barca board insist he is still their captain. Messi, who has played for Barcelona for almost 20 years, informed the Catalan club last week of his intentions to leave. The Barca number 10 missed the club’s training on Monday and Tuesday as he no longer considers himself a part of Ronald Koeman’s squad. His father and representative, Jorge, arrived at Barcelona on Wednesday morning to meet with the Barcelona chiefs, including, president Josep Maria Bartomeu to discuss his son’s future Reacting to the development, TB Joshua, in a tweet via his official Twitter handle, urged Messi not to leave the Blaugrana bitter and offended.

It is impossible to establish a healthy relationship with a person who left a previous relationship bitter and offended. This is my candid advice to Messi. History is our boss.”

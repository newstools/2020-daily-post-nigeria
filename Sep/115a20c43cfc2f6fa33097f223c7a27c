Manchester United are in talks over a possible deal for Edinson Cavani, according to Gianluca Di Marzio. It is believed that United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is searching for a new striker in the transfer market. Cavani is a free agent, after his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expired this summer. Another option available to Solskjaer is Real Madrid outcast, Luka Jovic, with tentative discussions also being held there. “Man Utd looking for a new striker: talks ongoing with @ECavaniOfficial and with @realmadrid for #Jovic,” Di Marzio tweeted. Marcus Rashford, Anthony Martial and Odion Ighalo are Solskjaer’s current options in centre forward.

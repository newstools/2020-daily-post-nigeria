Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki on Tuesday said President Muhammadu Buhari should be remembered as the father of democracy in Nigeria. “This is because the president had a choice to ensure and insist that his party wins in the state but he rose above partisan politics and insisted the right be done,” he said. Obaseki said this after receiving his certificate of return. He also extended a hand of fellowship to Osagie Ize-Iyamu, and other colleagues in the APC to move Edo forward. Obaseki also commended the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC’s National Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, for his steadfastness and withstanding pressure during Saturday’s election. “Despite all the criticisms, the ability of INEC to view results as the counting was taking place in polling units is one innovation we urge INEC to maintain and improve on. “This has introduced a different element of transparency in the way we conduct elections in Nigeria. Obaseki also hailed His Royal Majesty, Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, for his fatherly role, for the prayers for peace, and for being that symbol we all look up to.

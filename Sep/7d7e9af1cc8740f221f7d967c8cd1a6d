Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has predicted Arsenal and Tottenham will miss out on a place in the top four this season. The two north London rivals finished sixth and eighth respectively last term. Ferdinand believes that the two clubs will miss out, because Manchester United and Chelsea will finish ahead of them. Speaking to the Five YouTube channel, Ferdinand named his top four in order: “I’m going Man City, Liverpool, Manchester United and Chelsea.” Arsenal have not played Champions League football in four consecutive years. Tottenham desperately need to finish in the top four consistently, to help pay for their new stadium.

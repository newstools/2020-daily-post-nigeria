An FCT High Court sitting in Nyanya on Wednesday sentenced a man, Akindele Ajewole to life imprisonment for defiling his nine- year- old daughter. The prosecuting counsel, Mr Donatus Abah told the court that Ajewole of Sauka Village, Lugbe, Abuja sexually abused his daughter severally since 2014 when she was 9. He informed the court that this offence contravenes section 31 (1) of the Child s Right Act. However, Ajewole pleaded guilty to the first count out of the five-counts levelled against him by the police, NAN reports. The Justice, Peter Kekemeke while delivering judgment after the guilty plea, held that count one for which the defendant was charged is of strict liability. “The court has no discretion to exercise in the matter, the offence of sexual harassment is becoming rampant in the society. ”There is a need to protect our children particularly, the female children from every form of exploitation and abuse even from their parents as in this case. ”There is need to bequeath to the society sanity and rectitude the defendant is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment &quot,” the Judge said.

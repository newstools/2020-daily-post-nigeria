Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has backed Jurgen Klopp’s claim that some clubs in the Premier League, have bypassed financial difficulties during the COVID-19 outbreak because they are owned by oligarchs and countries. Liverpool boss, Klopp, made the remarks after his side’s transfer business this window was repeatedly compared to the big-spending Chelsea and Manchester City. Backed by owner Roman Abramovich, Chelsea is close to a £250 million outlay in transfers so far, but Mourinho said Tottenham were run differently just like Liverpool. “The other day Jurgen was saying Liverpool wasn’t a club of oligarchs and a club that belongs to countries,” Mourinho said in a press conference on Friday. “We are the same. So we are not the kind of club that can go to the market and spend a fortune on players. “We are all working hard, I want to make it very, very clear, to get a good balance and that good balance would be to get one more striker.” Liverpool has made just one signing so far, while Tottenham has spent a combined £30m on Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, Matt Doherty and Joe Hart.

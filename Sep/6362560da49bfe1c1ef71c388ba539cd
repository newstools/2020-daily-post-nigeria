Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, has tested positive to COVID-19, France Football reports. Mbappe, who has no symptoms of the virus, has left the France national team squad on Monday. He will not feature for Les Bleus in their next UEFA’s Nations League fixture with Croatia in Paris on Tuesday. The 21-year-old featured in France’s 1-0 victory against Sweden on Saturday and scored the winning goal in the encounter. He could also miss PSG’s Ligue 1 clash against Lens on Thursday. Mbappe is now the latest PSG player to have contracted COVID-19 after Neymar, Angel Di Maria and Leandro Paredes all tested positive last week.

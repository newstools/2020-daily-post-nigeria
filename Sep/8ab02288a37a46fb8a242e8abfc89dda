The Ogun State Government has said it is not ready to reopen schools at the moment. Following the directive of the Lagos State Governor, Mr Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to reopen schools in the state, there have been speculations that Ogun State might follow suit. Because of its proximity to Lagos, there were thoughts that Ogun may copy the state and reopen places of learning. DAILY POST reports that all schools in Ogun State have been closed since March to forestall the spread of coronavirus. But, the Ogun State Government said it is not going to copy Lagos in the reopening of schools. This was disclosed by the Special Adviser to Governor Dapo Abiodun on Public Communications, Hon. Remmy Hazzan. Hazzan, while featuring on Splash FM Abeokuta on Monday, said the government of Ogun State was not in hurry to reopen its primary and secondary schools as well as tertiary institutions of learning. Hazzan maintained that the state will wait for the Federal Government’s directive to reopen schools, saying Ogun would avoid taking an uninformed decision in following Lagos to do same. According to him, the schools were shut on the directives of the Federal Government, stressing that the reopening can only happen after the Federal Government must have given further directive on the matter. While saying the state will look at the various database using available empirical data, Hazzan said Ogun will not love to be seen as a state that is “anti-Federal Government.” He said the government would also put into consideration, the safety of students when they return to schools amid COVID-19. “The fact that Lagos has done it is not an indicator that we have to be in a hurry to do it,” he stated in clear terms. He recalled the efforts put in place by government at all levels for the resumption of pupils for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination, adding that the full reopening of schools will follow the same model to avoid a surge in cases of COVID-19.

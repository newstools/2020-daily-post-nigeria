Manchester City left-back, Joao Cancelo, has predicted that Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi will have a ‘great season’ if he eventually joins Pep Guardiola’s side this summer. Messi’s future at Barcelona is unclear after the Argentine surprised Barca board last week when he asked for his contract, which has 12 months still to run, to be terminated under an end-of-season release clause. The 33-year-old forward had drawn the interest of many European top clubs including Man City, Manchester United, Juventus, Paris Saint-Germain and Inter Milan in the past few days. But Cancelo believes Messi will thrive in English football because he would be surrounded by great players at Man City. “Messi is a great player. I won’t say that he’s not. He’s a great player,” Cancelo told RTP, via Sport Witness. “And in a team like Manchester City, of course, also with great players on his side, he would have a great season.”

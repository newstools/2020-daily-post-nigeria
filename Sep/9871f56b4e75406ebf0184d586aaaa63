Police in Jigawa State have sealed and taken over the state headquarters of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Dutse. DAILY POST correspondent observed that well armed policemen have barricaded all the access roads preventing motorists and passersby from accessing the main building of the party’s headquarters. This may not be unconnected with the current leadership tussle that hit the party recently. DAILY POST had reported that the party chairman, Habibu Sani Sara was suspended after the meeting of state party caucus held last week at Government House, Dutse. He was suspended over alleged misappropriation of fund. They appointed his secretary, Muhammad Dikuma Umar to serve as chairman in acting capacity. The embattled chairman, however, said the suspension was null and void and contrary to the party’s constitution. There were insinuations that the suspension of the APC acting chairman may not have been unconnected with 2023 election as he was alleged to be behind one gubernatorial aspirant which is said to be against the wish of top party figures in the State. The state Public Relations Officer of the party, Alhaji Nasuru Jahun, who confirmed the suspension of Alhaji Habibi Sara told DAILY POST that the caucus and top party officials are currently holding meetings and would address the press later.

The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has said that President Muhammadu Buhari’s assumption of office in 2015 prevented Nigeria from becoming a failed state. Mohammed said Buhari saved Nigeria after what he called a “long stretch of rapacious and rudderless leadership.” The minister stated this in a statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST by his Media Aide, Segun Adeyemi. He stated that Buhari assumed power at a time when the country was besieged by insurgents, stressing that many Nigerian towns and cities, including the capital city of Abuja, were a playground for insurgents. Mohammed also pointed out that prior to Buhari’s assumption of power, Nigeria’s wealth had been looted dry, with little or nothing to show for the nation’s huge earnings. He said: ”Nigeria today faces a lot of challenges. But whatever situation the country has found itself in, things would have been much worse but for the deft management of resources, unprecedented fight against corruption, determined battle against insurgency and banditry as well as the abiding courage of Mr President in piloting the ship of state. ”Nigeria today is not a failed state, but a nation that is courageously tackling its challenges and building solid infrastructure that will serve as the basis for socio-economic development, a nation that is unrelenting in battling insecurity and working hard to ensure greatest prosperity for the greatest number of people.”

The Presidency has said that Nigeria is ‘collapsing’ forward under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government. Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, made the remark in response to a remark by former President, Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo had said Nigeria was more divided and becoming a basket case under the Buhari-led administration. Speaking at an event in Abuja, the former president had said Nigeria needed to be rescued from the brink of collapse. Faulting Obasanjo’s remark, Adesina said Nigeria was collapsing forward under Buhari in forward trajectory. Adesina stated this in an article posted on Facebook titled: “YES, NIGERIA IS COLLAPSING FORWARD.” Adesina said: “The former President says the country is collapsing. I agree. Nigeria is collapsing forward. In diverse ways, under President Muhammadu Buhari, the collapse is in a forward trajectory, despite all the odds. “Chief Obasanjo talked about the mismanagement of our diversity, saying it is leading to collapse. True? False. Nigeria, since 1914, had been an uneasy Federation.”

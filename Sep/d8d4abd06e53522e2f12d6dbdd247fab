Controversial Nollywood actor, Uche Maduagwu, has blasted Big Brother Naija lockdown housemate, Laycon, for failing to win the Head of House (HOH) challenge for once. Maduagwu said that Laycon is too ‘weak’ to win the HOH, adding that the 26-year-old singer can’t win the N85m grand prize. Recall that Erica won the HOH challenge for the week and chose Prince as her deputy HOH which means that both housemates are saved from Sunday’s eviction. “If Laycon is too weak to win ordinary head of house challenge that kiddwaya wins even while asleep, how is it possible for Laycon to smell winning bbnaija5 towel or erica sex decorated bbnaija pant not to talk of bbnaija2020 money?,” Maduagwu wrote on Instagram on Saturday. “Do you want the poor boy to faint in Lagos before Davido finally signs him as a dmw houseboy? Meanwhile, Laycon had on Friday told Biggie that he is seriously pained and feels like crying for having failed to win the HOH challenge for once. According to Laycon, it’s a shame that he will again be standing this Sunday as one of the housemates up for possible eviction. Speaking at his diary session, Laycon told Biggie, “This week has been going successfully except for the Head of House thing. “I am really pained about that. To be frank, Big Brother, I feel like crying and [I ask myself], am I really going to step into that place [HOH room] before leaving this place?

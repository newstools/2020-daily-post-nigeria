The Olofin of Iseri, Oba Nurudeen Adebowale, has joined his ancestors. Confirming the demise of the traditional ruler on Monday, the immediate past Governor of Ogun State, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, said he commiserated with the Egba Traditional Council. Amosun, who is the incumbent Senator representing Ogun Central also sympathised with the people of Ifo Local Government and the entire people of Iseri Olofin on the passage of the monarch. In a statement signed by his Media Aide, Bola Adeyemi, on Monday, the Senator described Oba Adebowale as a royal father with dignity; saying he was a fearless defender of the interest of his subjects and the people in general. “Kabiyesi supported government’s developmental efforts through useful advice on government programmes throughout his reign. “He was frank in his submissions at various fora and highly committed to the welfare of the people in his domain,” Amosun was quoted as saying. Amosun said the demise of the Olofin has created a great vacuum in the Egba Traditional Council. He prayed that Almighty God will grant him eternal rest and give his people the fortitude to bear the demise.

Atiku Abubakar, former Vice-President and presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections, on Sunday, said the victory of Governor Godwin Obaseki has put an end to godfatherism in Nigeria’s politics. Atiku, in a statement entitled ‘The End of Godfatherism Has Come in Nigeria’, described Obaseki’s victory as a new chapter in Edo state. He said: “There is a new dawn in Edo State, and the hard-won victory of Governor Godwin Nogheghase Obaseki is not just a victory, but a declaration of Independence from the anti-democratic forces of godfatherism and militarism. “Edo has a rich history as the centre of Black civilisation, and to this, she is adding a new record as the bastion of Nigerian democracy.” According to Atiku, Obaseki’s win is a “double whammy of ancient and modern glories is a testament to a people who have for centuries set the pace as a beacon of light on the African continent.” The former Vice President further congratulated the PDP who stood by the people of Edo state adding that the “PDP has shown that they are not fair-weather friends to the good people of Edo. “In bad times, we will be your loyal ‘comrade’. We will never be a turncoat. PDP will never abandon the principles we once espoused so that we can dine with our nemesis. According to him, “Edo election has proved that democracy has no nemesis. And this, the PDP has again proved.”

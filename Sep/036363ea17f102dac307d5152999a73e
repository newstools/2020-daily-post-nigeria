Education Minister, Adamu Adamu, is reportedly in a hospital in Berlin, Germany. SaharaReporters says the latest trip was the third time Adamu would be flown abroad in recent months. The minister is reportedly undergoing treatment for a kidney related procedure. However, the reason for the current trip is still unknown. There are concerns that his absence has affected issues including reopening of schools, the University of Lagos (UNILAG) leadership imbroglio, among others. The federal government eventually named John Momoh as acting Chairman of the Governing Council after removing Wale Babalakin. Adamu, who has not been seen in public in recent weeks, is expected back in the country soon. Born May 25, 1956, Adamu is a long time ally of President Muhammadu Buhari. Prior to his appointment as Minister in 2015, the Bauchi indigene was the Secretary of Buhariâ€™s Presidential Transition Committee.

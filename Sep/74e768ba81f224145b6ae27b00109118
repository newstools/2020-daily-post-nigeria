Vanessa Bryant has reacted to the allegation by her mother, Sofia Laine who claimed that she kicked her out of her house after Kobe Bryant’s death. Sofia Laine in an interview with Univision‘s El Gorda y La Flaca said Vanessa took her car from her and stopped being supportive in the wake of Kobe’s passing. She said: “[Vanessa told me, ‘I need you to get out of this house.’ She said she wanted her car immediately too.” However, Vanessa Bryant, whose husband and daughter died only months ago, in a statement released to Univision accused her mother of trying to play the victim’s card and trick the public to get sympathy. Part of her statement read: “My husband and daughter passed away unexpectedly, and yet my mother had the audacity to do a television interview speaking negatively of me while shedding tears for a car and a house that were not in her name. “She has removed all her diamond jewelries, emptied the apartment I provided, and put away the furniture to make it look like she doesn’t have my support. “Kobe and I supported her financially for the past 20 years, and continue to do so, in addition to her monthly alimony.”

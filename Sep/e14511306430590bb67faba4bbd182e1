Forwards, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronnaldo, are the two players that scored more goals than winger, Gareth Bale, at Real Madrid since 2013. According to Opta Joe, only Benzema (160) and Ronaldo (249) scored more goals than Bale (105) in all competitions for Real Madrid since the Wales international joined Real Madrid from Tottenham Hotspur seven years ago . Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo were the only players at the Los Blancos to score 60 goals plus within the period. Bale has already bid farewell to his Real Madrid teammates and even wished coach Zinedine Zidane good luck, ahead of his move to Tottenham Hotspur this summer. The 31-year-old has undergone his medical in Madrid and will return to his former club on a one-year loan. Both Real Madrid and Tottenham have reached an agreement, which will see his £600,000-a-week salary split between the two clubs. Bale is due to fly to London on Friday alongside Real Madrid defender, Sergio Reguilon, who Tottenham are also signing from the La Liga champions in a £27.6 million deal. He visited Madrid’s training complex on Thursday to say farewell to his teammates despite being cast aside by Zidane last season at the Santiago Bernabeu.

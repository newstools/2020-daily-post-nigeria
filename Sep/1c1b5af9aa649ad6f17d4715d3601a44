Manchester United striker, Marcus Rashford, has won the club’s Goal of the 2019/20 Season. Rashford won the prize for his brilliant strike against Chelsea. The England international unleashed a phenomenal free-kick from long distance to give the Red Devils a 2-1 victory against Chelsea in the Carabao Cup fourth round-meeting at Stamford Bridge last October. It was one of 10 efforts selected for the club’s goal of the season last month. Rashford saw off competitions from Bruno Fernandes, Anthony Martial, Mason Greenwood, Odion Ighalo, Scott McTominay, Daniel James and Harry Maguire to win the award. Man United announced this in a post on its official website on Thursday. The 22-year-old scored 22 goals in 44 games for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side last season.

Manchester United have made a breakthrough in their efforts to land Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund, by resolving the issue of agent fees and personal terms, according to Sky Sports. United have not given up on signing Sancho, despite Dortmund’s sporting director Michael Zorc suggesting the 20-year-old will not leave in this window. However, despite the Bundesliga club’s stance, during the last 24 hours progress has been made between United and Sancho’s representatives. It is understood that United are remaining tight-lipped on these developments. Dortmund value Sancho at £108m, a fee the Red Devils view as “unrealistic” for a player the Bundesliga side signed for just £7.2m three years ago. Sancho provided 17 goals and 16 assists in 32 league games last season, as well as helping Dortmund win the German Super Cup.

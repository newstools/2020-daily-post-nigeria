The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Lagos State has said that the October 31 by-election in the State would be in compliance with the COVID-19 pandemic protocols. The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr Sam Olumekun, gave the assurance on Thursday during a courtesy call on him by the National Youth Service Corp (NYSC) management, led by its new State Coordinator, Mr Edwin Megwa. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the visit was part of preparations for the October 31 by-election in Lagos East Senatorial district and Kosofe II Constituency Lagos State House of Assembly. The INEC Commissioner noted that elections should not serve as an avenue to spread the virus. He said that all the protocols issued by the NCDC, Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, State Committees on COVID-19 and other relevant health authorities shall be observed by election officials and all stakeholders during the bye-elections. Olumekun also commended the Federal Government for including the NYSC management in the conduct of an election, noting that it was a turning point for good in the country. According to him, it is quite ingenious to come up with the idea, adding that things are getting better with the arrangement. “Our conduct of elections are credible, and we now enjoy international acceptability. “I appreciate the support the Commission enjoyed from the NYSC in the last general elections, especially the role played by the immediate past Coordinator, Prince Mohmoh, to the success achieved in the state,” he said

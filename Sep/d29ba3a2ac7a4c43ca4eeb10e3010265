Speaking on the development, Santo said at his pre-match press conference on Saturday ahead of Wolves’ Premier League clash with Manchester City on Monday night, “First I want to apologise to those on Thursday for my answers, but you understand. “What Diogo did for us was absolutely fantastic. I think Diogo is going to the right place and we wish him all the best. “He’ll never be forgotten by our fans. Now we have to balance our squad better. We know the type of player we want to bring and where we need to work on in our squad.” “Diogo is joining Liverpool, and Ki will join us. He’s not eligible for the match on Monday. “Liverpool is going to have a great player and boy, Diogo was really happy here, but it’s normal that players like to face new challenges.”

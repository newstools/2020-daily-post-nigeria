Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has expressed happiness at the news that captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has signed a new contract with the Gunners. Arteta said it was important for Aubameyang to stay at the North London club, adding that the Gabonese international can achieve his heart desires at the club. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Aubameyang on Tuesday signed a new three-year contract with Arsenal that will see him remain at Emirates until 2023. “It was important for Pierre-Emerick to stay with us,” Arteta told Arsenal’s official website. “He is a superb player with an incredible mentality. Being the player to have taken the least amount of time to reach 50 goals with this club tells you everything you need to know about him and his way of working. “He is an important leader for the team and a big part of what we are building. “He wants to be up there with the best players in the world and leave his mark. He can achieve that here.”

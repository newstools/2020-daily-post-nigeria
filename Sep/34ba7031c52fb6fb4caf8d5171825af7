It is very unfortunate that the incident happened. May Almighty God in his infinite mercy forgive and reward them for their sacrifices and may He grant you the strength to bear the fortitude of this huge loss. “It is so sad, looking at what happened. It is quite unfortunate and I am pained by that incident. However, those men died as heroes, as patriots and as people that have brought honour to their families even though we never wished that it happened”, Zulum said. The Borno helmsman assured that the state government will assist the families at this trying time. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-843891" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EjBnqhbXgAIUp2-.jpeg" alt="" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EjBnqhbXgAIUp2-.jpeg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EjBnqhbXgAIUp2--300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EjBnqhbXgAIUp2--1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> “Government will not publicly announce the nature of support, so that it does not appear as if the support equalled the values of the lives of those killed. Nothing can compensate for the life of a human being. Insha Allah, we shall do everything possible to support the families. “The education of their children is very important in addition to the support for their means of livelihood. I want to once again sympathize with the families on behalf of the grateful people of Borno State. I condole with the Borno state police command, the CP, the Inspector General of Police, the Nigeria Police Force and entire Nigerians over the sad moment.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-843892" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EjBnqH_WkAIM9h_.jpeg" alt="" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EjBnqH_WkAIM9h_.jpeg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EjBnqH_WkAIM9h_-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/EjBnqH_WkAIM9h_-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> Zulum was also at the State Specialist Hospital in Maiduguri to console security operatives wounded in the ambush.

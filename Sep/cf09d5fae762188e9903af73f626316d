The people of Ozalla-Abor Community, in Udi Local Government Area of Enugu State, have invited the state government to acquire community land measuring 132 hectares for development projects including a housing estate. The invitation was contained in a letter from Ozalla-Abor General Assembly, signed by the Traditional Ruler of Abor, HRH Igwe Chukwudi Ngwudile, the Chairman, Ozalla-Abor General Assembly, John Nnabuchukwu Onyechi, the Chairman, Power of Attorney Ozalla-Abor General Assembly, Uchenna Njeze and the President General of Abor Town Union, Mr. Ifeanyi Ekwo. Other signatories to the letter were the Secretary, Power of Attorney Ozalla-Abor General Assembly, Ferdinard C. Agbo and the Secretary, Ozalla-Abor General Assembly, Emmanuel Emefu. While expressing their heartfelt gratitude to Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi “for the good governance, peace and security his administration has brought to the state”, the people of the community said: “We hereby grant Enugu State Government access to enter the land measuring approximately 132 hectares, acquire and develop same for the good of Enugu State on terms of compensation to be mutually agreed”. They pointed out that “the benefits accruing from this housing project would not only bring unprecedented development to our ancestral home, but would also have a multiplier effect on the fortunes of our people”. According to them, “the siting of South East Area Office of the Industrial Training Fund in this location would also come with employment opportunities, contracts, infrastructural development and most importantly, access road to our community”. The people of the community, therefore, requested that “all those who legitimately bought land belonging to Ozalla-Abor Community, prior to the official acquisition by the Enugu State Government, should approach the community leadership with evidence of such transactions, for ratification and reconciliation, saying: “Thank you, Your Excellency, for your magnanimity to our people”.

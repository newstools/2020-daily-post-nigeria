Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, faces a defining day in his football career, with fresh reports claiming he will make a U-turn over his decision to leave the club. On Wednesday, Messi’s father and agent, Jorge, met with Barca president Josep Bartomue. The meeting reportedly ended in a stalement, with no agreement reached over the 33-year-old’s decision to leave the Camp Nou. Messi’s camp insists the six-time Ballon d’Or winner can leave for free this summer, while Barca claim the date for his exit clause has passed. TyC Sports claims Messi is considering a dramatic U-turn and seeing out the remaining year of his current contract. It is understood senior figures at Barcelona have pleaded with Messi to stay, and that he will spend Thursday considering his options, but is “90% likely to stay”.

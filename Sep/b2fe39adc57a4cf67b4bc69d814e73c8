The Senate Chief Whip, Senator Uzor Orji Kalu, on Monday, said that he would serve as Nigeria’s President if given the opportunity by the electorate. The former Abia State governor made the remark when he visited Gen. Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida (Rtd) and Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar (rtd) in Minna. “I am still in the Senate, and I will seek for re-election into the Senate, but if our people want me to serve as President I will not hesitate,” NAN quoted him as saying. He maintained that there was no zoning in the APC constitution, adding that anyone in the APC can contest for the position of the President. Speaking on the insecurity issue in the country, Kalu alleged that there was sabotage in the country’s security system. He, however, expressed optimism that the National Assembly would continue to collaborate with the executive in tackling the security challenges in the country.

Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, has reacted to the increment of petrol pump price by the Nigerian government. Fani-Kayode recalled warning Nigerians against voting Muhammadu Buhari in 2015. Recall that the Pipelines and Product Marketing Company (PPMC), had announced an increment in the pump price of petrol. PPMC, a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, had announced N151.56 per litre as the new pump price of petrol. However, Fani-Kayode said Nigerians should expect more from Buhari government. In a tweet, the former minister wrote: “Fuel =N87, ECA =$2.5bn, Dollar =N200, Bag of rice =N8,500, External debt =$9.7b “2020, Fuel =N150, ECA =$72m, Dollar =N475, Bag of rice =N25,000. External debt =$27bn. “In the 2015 presidential campaign, I warned Nigerians that this would happen if Buhari was elected. “I shouted it on the rooftops morning day and night but the people refused to listen. Instead, they insulted me and rejected GEJ. Let them continue with their insults and enjoy their plight. This is a sad testimony but worse of all is that there is far more to come. Sai Baba!”

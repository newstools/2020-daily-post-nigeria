Alexis Sanchez has claimed he wanted to leave Manchester United after one training session and return to Arsenal. The Chilean attacker completed a move away from the Emirates in January 2018. He endured a nightmare spell at Old Trafford, scoring five goals in 45 games, before joining Inter Milan on loan for the 2019/2020. Sanchez made the move permanent this summer. He scored just five goals in 45 matches before moving to Inter Milan on loan for the 2019-20 season, a move which he made permanent last summer. And Sanchez, 31, who confirmed a Manchester City move collapsed before he joined United, revealed that he asked to move back to Arsenal after just one day of training under Jose Mourinho. “I got the opportunity to go to United and it seemed tempting to me. It was something nice for me, because when I was a kid I liked that club a lot. “I ended up signing without much information about what was happening in the move. The first days that I was with my colleagues, sometimes there are things that you do not realise until you arrive. “The first training I had I realised many things and I told my representative: “Can’t the contract be terminated to return to Arsenal?” “They start laughing and I told them that something did not sit right with me. It had already been signed,” Sanchez said in an Instagram video.

The federal government has declared Thursday, October 1, a public holiday to mark Nigeria’s 60th Independence Anniversary celebration. Minister of Interior, Rauf Aregbesola, made the announcement on Tuesday. Nigeria is the leading black nation in the world, Africa’s pride and beacon of hope, he declared. Aregbesola congratulated citizens on the Diamond Jubilee and assured of the government’s commitment to socio-economic transformation. “Our warmth, welcoming spirit and love as well as the abundant wealth inherent in our human capital and the richness of our land, makes Nigeria unarguably the leading black nation in the world and Africa’s pride and beacon of hope if we can rally ourselves together to harness our potentials. “A country of about 200 million people whose natural talent, grit and passion glitter like the precious diamond that we are. Nigerians are sparkling like diamonds in the pack, whether in Academia, Business, Innovation, Music, Movie, Entertainment, Fashion and culture.” Aregbesola noted that the celebration would be low-key due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The minister advised Nigerians to join hands with the Buhari administration in its quest to ensure a better nation.

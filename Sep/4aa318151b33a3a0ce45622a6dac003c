A couple, Niyi and Remilekun Folorunso, have been arrested alongside two others for allegedly cutting off a human skull from a grave in Odogbolu area of Ogun State. Men of Ogun State Police Command said the suspects were arrested on Thursday “for unlawfully being in possession of human skulls.” The other suspects were identified by the police as Muyideen Tolubi and Sonubi Taiwo. They were reportedly arrested following information received by the police in Odogbolu division that they were “digging a grave with the aim of removing an already buried corpse who was not in any way related to them.” The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST that the DPO Odogbolu, CSP Afolabi Yusuf, had led his detectives to the scene but the suspects have already removed the head of the corpse and left. Oyeyemi informed that police thereafter “embarked on an intelligence-based investigation, leading to the arrest of the couple as well as Muyideen Tolubi. “The three of them confessed being the persons that dug the grave and removed the head of the corpse. They later took detectives to Ikenne where the fourth person who asked them to bring the head for ritual purpose was apprehended,” he revealed. DAILY POST reports that the Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun has directed the transfer of the suspects to the State CIID at Eleweran Abeokuta for investigations and possible prosecution.

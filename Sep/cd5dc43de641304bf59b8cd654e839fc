The Presidential Task Force, PTF, on COVID-19, has revealed that the low coronavirus cases recorded across the country is due to the decline in testing by states. The Head of Disease Surveillance for the NCDC, Elsie Ilori, who disclosed this on Monday during the COVID-19 briefing said that the low testing was due to low sample collection. According to him, States like Kano, Lagos, Oyo, Edo, and FCT, had the biggest decrease in the number of samples collected in August. “In the month of August, we had a very low number of samples collected. ”In July, we had 13 states that actually collected over 1,000 samples but in August, no state met that target. “That means we had zero states collecting over 1,000 samples. “For the local government areas, in July we had 515 that collected samples and it decreased to 478 in August. “In August, states with the biggest increase are Abia (682), Sokoto (331), Bayelsa (314), Zamfara (55), and Yobe (12), but the numbers are not significant at all. “In the same month, the biggest decrease in sample collection was in Kano (19,108), Lagos (13,146), Oyo (4,902), Edo (3,327), and FCT (3,322) making the August sample collection to decrease drastically. “Also in August, no local government in Kogi collected samples. In Katsina, only 24 local government areas collected samples, Jigawa (22), Kano (20), and Taraba (16). “In Lagos, all the local government areas are collecting samples, but the number of samples collected now is quite low. ‘However, this brought down the number of samples collected for August,” he said.

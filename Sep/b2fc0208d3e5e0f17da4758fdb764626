The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will transfer 6,000 card readers from its Oyo State office to Ondo State. They will be used for the governorship election on October 10. INEC National Commissioner, Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, said this at the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum in Abuja on Thursday. Okoye decried that fire recently destroyed 5,141 cards readers in Akure. “We have given an order that all the smart card readers in Oyo state office be moved to Ondo. They have over 6,000 smart card readers, so we are not going to have any problems reconfiguring and using them for the election.” He explained that the movement was because of the waiting time for purchase of new ones. Okoye said the process of ordering one unit takes at least six months. The official added that INEC was exploring a more secured way of securing its equipment and facilities.

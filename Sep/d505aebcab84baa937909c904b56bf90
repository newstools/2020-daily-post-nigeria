One Fathia Ojewoye has been raped and killed by yet-to-be identified persons in Ogun State. The 14-year-old secondary school pupil, who was expected to resume school on Monday, was found dead in an uncompleted building on Saturday at Agbeloba-Oriyonrin area of Abeokuta, the State capital. The Ogun State Police Command has confirmed the ugly incident. DAILY POST learnt that Fathia had been declared missing by her parents on Wednesday, three days before her lifeless body was found. It was gathered that the teenagerâ€™s mother had sent her to refill their cooking gas cylinder around the area. She did not return home since then.

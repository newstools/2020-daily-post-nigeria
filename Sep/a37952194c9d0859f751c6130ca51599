The President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Rev. Olasupo Ayokunle, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure the suspension of the implementation of the Companies and Allied Matters Act, CAMA. Ayokunle warned that the CAMA Act was inimical to the interest, security, peace and stability of Nigerians, hence should be suspended. He gave the call in a statement he issued, on Tuesday. Recall that Buhari had on August 7, 2020, signed the amended CAMA Act into law. But, Christian leaders have faulted the act which they insisted is targeting the church. He stressed that the Act did not receive input from “various interest groups” and failed “to accommodate their views.” Ayokunle stated that there was no point in seeking “judicial intervention or amendment of the Act by the National Assembly” as such “shall achieve nothing much.” He said: “We consider the Act, as indeed, a complex of statecraft compendium, laden with issues that are grossly inimical to national interest, security (- peace and stability), and overall wellbeing of the Nigerian-state. “Mr. President, we are of the opinion that you should kindly issue the appropriate directives to suspend the implementation of CAMA 2020 and affirm a thorough reappraisal of the legislation that is in correlation with the provisions of the 1999 Constitution of Nigeria (as amended), other extant legal and policy frameworks, the national economy, national security, national interest and the wellbeing of the Nigerian-state.”

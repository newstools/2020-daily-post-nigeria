Liverpool defender, Andy Robertson, has disclosed that he does not want Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi anywhere near the Premier League amid interest from Manchester City. Barcelona is currently battling to keep Messi as the 33-year-old pushes for a free transfer to reunite with manager, Pep Guardiola, at Manchester City. But Robertson hopes Messi stays at Barcelona instead of the Argentine making a sensational switch to Liverpool’s rival, Man City. “From a completely selfish point of view, I hope it does not happen. Hopefully, he stays at Barca,” Robertson was quoted by Goal as saying when asked about the possibility of Messi playing in the Premier League. “He is one of, if not the best player to ever play the game so for him to go to one of your nearest rivals is probably never a good sign. “He is a fantastic player. I’ve no doubt if he came to the Premier League he would bring the exact same quality, the same passion and everything he brings at Barca. “I think Liverpool have ruled out that we are going to sign him, so for me, I do not want him anywhere near the Premier League, and hopefully it stays that way, but we will wait and see what happens with that.”

Chelsea midfielder, N’Golo Kante, has ruled out any possibility of leaving the club this summer despite the club revealing his price tag. DAILY POST recalls that Chelsea had placed a massive £80m price tag on Kante. Kante had emerged as a target for Inter Milan manager, Antonio Conte, who is targeting at least three players from Chelsea this summer. Conte is preparing to raid his former club, to improve his squad ahead of the 2020/21 season. The Italian coach wants to be reunited with Kante, as well as left-back, Emerson Palmieri and striker Olivier Giroud. However, according to Telefoot, France international is happy at Stamford Bridge and has no interest in moving to Inter Milan this summer. The report added that Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard, believes Kante, who is widely considered as one of the best midfielders in the world will be essential for the Blues if they are to challenge for the Premier League title in the 2020/21 season. Kante, 29, struggled with injuries last season. The former Leicester City star made just 22 Premier League appearances for Lampard’s side as they finished fourth.

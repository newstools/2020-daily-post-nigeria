Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said that for him to stay at Etihad beyond the expiry of his current contract, he must first prove he deserves to be kept on as the club’s head coach. Guardiola’s contract with Man City will expire next summer. The Spaniard is in his fifth campaign at Man City, the longest spell of his managerial career. “I would love to stay longer here [at Man City],” Guardiola was quoted by Man City’s official website as saying ahead of Wolves clash on Monday night. “It’s a place I love to be, but I’ve to deserve it. In the last decade, they have maintained standards, and I have to maintain it. “To extend the contract, I’ve to deserve it, and we are going to see if I deserve it this season, in terms of how the team goes forward and improves.”

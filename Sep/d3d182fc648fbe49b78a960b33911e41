Reno Omokri, a former aide to Ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has blasted Nigerians for not showing much interest in resisting the increase in the pump price of fuel by the President Muhammadu Buhari Buhari government. Omokri lamented that the same Nigerians have in 3 hours raised the sum of $9000 for Big Brother Naija lockdown housemate, Erica, who was kicked out yesterday. Erica was kicked out of the Big Brother Naija lockdown house for breaking house rules. Erica who was the head of house also threatened to kill fellow housemate, Laycon outside the house. Omokri tweeted, “In 3 hours, Nigerians raised $9000 for #BBNaija’s Erica. In one week, the same Nigerians have not been able to raise any resistance to General @MBuhari’s increase in fuel and electricity costs. If you talk, they say come and lead it. Who led them to raise $9000?”

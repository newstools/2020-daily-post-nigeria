One Fisayo Akibu, a trader, on Tuesday approached a Customary Court sitting in Mapo, Ibadan, seeking the dissolution of her 19-year-old marriage to her husband, Abiodun over his addiction to gambling. Akibu said her husband puts all his earnings into betting rather than to care for their children. She said, “Since I married Abiodun in 2001, he has not performed the naming ceremonies rites for our children as expected of him. “Worst still, he curses and shouts at me to leave his home. “Please, give me custody of my daughter because I don’t trust what will happen to her in his custody”. Her husband, Abiodun, however, gave his consent for the divorce but denied all allegations against him. He also admitted to having some financial difficulties at some points. According to him, his wife allows any man who is ready to give her small money to sleep with her not minding that she is married. “One of our neighbours who earns his livelihood as a labourer (Baba Oche) is the one currently sleeping with her,” he said. Chief Ademola Odunade, the President of the court while delivering judgement dissolved the marriage and granted custody of the first child to Abiodun and the last three to the petitioner. He also ordered Abiodun to pay N15,000 as monthly feeding allowance, NAN reports.

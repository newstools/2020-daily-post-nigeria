Former Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Anto Lecky, has lamented about the pressures to keep up as a celebrity. Anto took to her Instagram page on Wednesday, opening up on the recent pressure on her as a celebrity. Her post read: “Too many things have been happening to me of late that force me to be honest with myself and accept that “life is hard”. According to her, being a public figure makes it harder for her because the public put a lot of pressure and expect them to keep up and have it together. “ I do not have all the answers like I think I do. Especially as a public figure, yeyebrity, influenza, what have you, we are expected to have it all together. Not sure why because we are humans like the next person. “There is pressure to keep up. We are in a place where our value is based on numbers and not our talent. No lie, shit is f*cked up,” she added. Anto further advised those celebrities by social media or by heart to keep pushing. “We all deserve to be celebrated, you are enough. You are more than enough.”

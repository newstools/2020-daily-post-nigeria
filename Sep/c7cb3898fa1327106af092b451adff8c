Arsenal midfielder, Matteo Guendouzi, has handed in a transfer request in a bid to secure a move away from the club, Lâ€™Equipe reports. Guendouzi has not played for Mikel Arteta, since their 2-1 loss to Brighton back in June. The 21-year-old has neither been involved on the pitch or named among the substitutes since then. The midfielder has now asked the club to leave, amid interest from clubs in France, Italy and Spain. Guendouzi has played more than 50 times in the Premier League for Arsenal, but does not seem to have a future at the club anymore. Arteta is also looking to bring in either Houssem Aouar or Thomas Partey.

Former Abia State Governor, Senator Orji Uzo Kalu, has said he has what it takes to bring Nnamdi Kanu back to Nigeria and convince him to drop the agitation for Biafra. The lawmaker said he only needs the permission of President Muhammadu Buhari to carry on the task. Kalu, in a statement he signed and made available to reporters in Abuja on Tuesday, said he is the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, will listen to him. The Senate Chief Whip said in reaction to the recent altercation between members of IPOB and security personnel in Enugu state. The former Governor stressed that he is a believer in one Nigeria, and believes that people of the country are so entangled with each other that no one should be talking about separation According to him, what Nigerians need to do now is focus on taking advantage of the country’s population to build a stronger economy. “If the Federal Government permits me, I will go to the United Kingdom and negotiate with Nnamdi Kanu to return to Nigeria. “I will convince him to drop the agitation for Biafra because our people don’t need it,” Kalu added. He maintained that what is needed at this point is a united Nigeria that will allow different cultures and tongues to live peacefully in any part of the country.

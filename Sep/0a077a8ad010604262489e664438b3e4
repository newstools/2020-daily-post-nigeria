Big Brother Housemate, Nengi has adviced her fellow housemate Ozo, to focus on why he came to the Lockdown house. Ozo was issued a second strike on Friday for breaking one of the rules in the Lockdown house after he was found guilty of writing a love letter to his love interest, Nengi. However, Nengi who was feeling guilty about the whole suituation told Ozo to leave her and face the game if she’s a distraction to him. She also told him to remember why he came into the house in the first place, adding that she feels she’s a distraction to him. “If I am a distraction please cut me off because I feel like I am a distraction to you. “Let’s leave all this whole love thing and focus on why we are here because this is a once in a life time opportunity. “We can’t come here and misuse the opportunity we have here and I have told you we have to start mingling with other housemates. “I am feeling guilty about all of this because I feel like I am the one making you do these stuffs. “Don’t let anything or anyone make you forget why you are here,” she said.

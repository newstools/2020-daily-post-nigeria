Two people have reportedly died and four others seriously injured in an auto crash which occurred along Anthony-inward-Gbagada in Lagos State. Dr Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, the Director-General, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), disclosed this on Wednesday to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Oke-Osanyintolu said that LASEMA received distress calls on the accident, around 10.30 p.m. on Tuesday. He explained that four vehicles were involved in the accident, which includes one petroleum tanker, one commercial bus and two tipper-lorries. According to him, the cause of the accidents was reckless driving that left occupants of the bus trapped. “With the use of the LASEMA’s light rescue equipment, six people were rescued from the bus. “They sustained varying degrees of injuries, and unfortunately, two female passengers died on the spot,’’ Oke-Osanyintolu said. Oke-Osanyintolu said the agency responders, comprising LASEMA Rescue Unit (LRU), the Nigeria Police, the Lagos Fire Service and the Lagos State Ambulance, were promptly mobilised to the scene for the rescue operation. He, however, noted that operation was still ongoing to recover all the vehicles out of the road.

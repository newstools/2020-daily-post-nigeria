Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya says he would encourage Laycon to keep his head up and be positive about himself if evicted during the Sunday night show. Kiddwaya made the disclosure during his diary session with big brother on Sunday. Kiddwaya said: “Keep your head up, we will meet on the outside, keep being yourself and act positively. “We will meet on the outside but enjoy yourself “I’m proud of your music, your story and be proud of yourself because you’ve achieved it already.”

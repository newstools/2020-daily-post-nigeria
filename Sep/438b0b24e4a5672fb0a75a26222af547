The Premier League says it is “disappointed that the safe return of supporters to matches has been postponed,” following the latest COVID-19 restrictions imposed by the UK Government. The planned return of fans to sports venues in England from October 1 could be delayed for up to six months, amid fears over a second wave. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday, announced restrictions in the House of Commons, including those related to mass gatherings. Johnson said: “We have to acknowledge that the spread of the virus is now affecting our ability to reopen business conferences, exhibitions and large sporting events. “So we will not be able to do this from October 1 and I recognise the implications for our sports clubs which are the life and soul of our communities, and my right honourable friends the Chancellor and the Culture Secretary are working urgently on what we can do now to support them.” However, the Premier League insists that they still believe that it is still possible for supporters to make a “safe return” to stadiums across the country.

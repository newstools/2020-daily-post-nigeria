A 13-year-old boy, identified as Umar Danladi, who was allegedly isolated and abused by his stepmother for more than a year, has been rescued by the police in Borno State. Danladi was abandoned by his biological mother in the family house after she was divorced from his father. It was learnt that the victim was put under the care of two stepmothers in a rented apartment in Maiduguri where officials of the interest group, WINNG, National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and the police operatives rescued him. He is said to be suffering from speech disorder and acute malnutrition following the long stay in an isolated room within his father’s home. A NHRC monitor, Junaid Jibrin Maiva, confirmed to DailyTrust that the stepmother has been arrested and detained for questioning. “The suspect and the victim have been taken to a police station where the father and the stepmother are detained. “The boy in question is presently at a clinic for treatment,” Maiva added.

Nnamdi Kanu, Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Wednesday, accused President Muhammadu Buhari of alleged plot to Islamize Nigeria. Kanu alleged that Buhari was plotting to use nepotism and Islamic terror to Islamize Nigeria. He made the allegation in a tweet on his verified Twitter handle. The IPOB leader explained that the alleged Islamization move was responsible for the nepotism in the appointment of Nigeria’s security forces. Kanu tweeted: “The nepotism by @NGRPresident and the ISLAMIC terror sweeping #Nigeria are part of a secret plot to Islamize Nigeria. “It’s not by accident that Nigeria’s security forces are led by extremist Fulani Islamists in uniform. If Northern Christians are cowed, the South can stop it.”

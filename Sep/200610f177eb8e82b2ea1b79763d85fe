Popular rapper, Cardi B has explained why she filed for divorce from her husband of three years and Migos rapper, Offset. The rap queen during an Insta Live session, on Saturday, disclosed that Offset’s infidelity was not the reason for their split. She also said she did not file for divorce as a publicity stunt for her upcoming album but because they couldn’t live together as a couple anymore. “I have seen all the love and prayers that you guys have been sending me, however, I don’t really need it. “ I want to let you all know that I’m okay and I have not shed not one tear. “Every single time that this guy has been so crazy, and it hits the media, I’m always crying, always sad because I don’t like that type of energy. “But this time, it’s different because I wasn’t crying. “You want to know why? The reason for my divorce is not because of any of that stuff that ever happened before. “It’s also not because of cheating because I’m seeing people be like, ‘Oh, he has a baby on the way. “That’s a whole complete lie and this is the second time people are trying to pin babies over here. “The issue is that I just got tired of constant arguments, I got tired of not seeing things eye to eye. “I felt like things aren’t the same anymore, so before anyone actually get cheated on, I rather just leave. “Nothing crazy out of this world happened, sometimes people really do grow apart. “I have been with this man for four years, I have a kid with him and also a household. “Sometimes you’re just tired of the arguments and the build up. “You get tired sometimes and before something bad happens, you leave,” she said.

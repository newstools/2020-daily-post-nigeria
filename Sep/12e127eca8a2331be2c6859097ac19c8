The Nigeria Police, Zone 13 in Ukpo, Anambra State in charge of Anambra, Enugu and Ebonyi have launched an investigation into a viral video alleging the influx of people from the north into the state. A video circulating in Anambra purports that some persons from the north have invaded the state, with a view to engaging in trouble. But the zonal public relations officer, DSP Nkiru Nwode in a press statement called on the people to discountenance the video, saying that there was no threat to security presently. She said, “We have come into the knowledge of a viral video purporting an influx of elements who according to the source purported to have been Fulani insurgent migrants into Agulu and Adazi areas of Anambra State by a barrage of motorcycles. “The content of the video also stated that the migration was intended to wreak mayhem on some communities of the state and called on the people to be vigilant and resist any attempt at heisting their localities. “The Assistant Inspector-General of Police; Danmallam Mohammed warned that while raising alarms on security, caution should be adopted so as not to incite the public against law and order and cause disaffection, tension and false security impression on the people and the land.” He said the AIG has, however, directed the Anambra State Command Commissioner of Police Abang John to tighten the security of Anambrarians and also to investigate the video and examine the contents so shared. “We employ you to be calm and go about your legal duties without fear of harassment,” the release read.

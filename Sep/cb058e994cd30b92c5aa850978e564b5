No fewer than 3,000 families have been affected by an erosion menace ravaging Okohia Akwakuma in Owerri North council area of Imo state. DAILY POST gathered that the affected families have been ordered by the government to immediately relocate to avoid loss of lives. The state Commissioner for Environment, Iyke Njoku who spoke to journalists on the issue disclosed that the government is considering short, medium and long term measures to prevent the slide from escalating. He lamented that the situation was beyond the state considering the dwindling economic state. According to him, Imo has over 300 erosion sites which are gradually being looked into, stressing that the best for the inhabitants of these sites was to vacate the places to avoid calamity. He said, “we are calling on the Federal Government, Ecological Fund Office and international agencies to come to our aid to save the places from submerging.” Meanwhile, one of the affected persons who spoke to newsmen (name withheld) frowned at the lackadaisical attitude of the government in proffering a solution to the menace. “They have ordered us to relocate. Where are we going? Did they provide a place for us to stay? The government should act fast and stop being insensitive to our plight. Our homes are being submerged by the gully erosion and the government is paying lip service.”

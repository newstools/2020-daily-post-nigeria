UEFA are set to announce that clubs will be allowed to use five substitutes in the Champions League and Europa League for the 2020/2021 season, SportsMail reports. It is a ruling that could put English teams at a significant disadvantage. LaLiga, Serie A, the Bundesliga and Ligue 1 have all continued using five subs this season, but the idea introduced during Project Restart, has been stopped by the Premier League. This means England’s top clubs could find themselves playing by different rules in domestic and European competitions. Europe’s top clubs have been lobbying UEFA all summer for five subs to be permitted, on the grounds of minimising player fatigue, in a season that has been cut by four weeks due to the impact of COVID-19. A decision will be made at UEFA’s Executive Committee meeting on Thursday. Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea will be England’s representatives in the Champions League.

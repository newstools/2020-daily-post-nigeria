Kola Ajayi, Alliance for Democracy (AD) Chairman in Lagos, has said that most opposition parties in the State are lazy. He declared that they had little or no fighting spirit to win elections. Ajayi spoke to NAN on Thursday while commenting on chances of the opposition parties on October 31. The date has been slated for Lagos East Senatorial and Kosofe State Constituency II bye-elections. “The problem we have is that most opposition parties are lazy. They are lazy in the sense that anytime there is an election, they only look for what to gain; they don’t prepare fully for the elections. “What they always do is trying to align with the ruling party for monetary gains. That is why I said most opposition parties are lazy,” said the former Chairman of Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC). He insisted that opposition parties can defeat the ruling party in the state (All Progressives Congress) if united and determined. “We have about 5.5 million registered voters in Lagos and during elections, only about a million come out to vote, the opposition parties can work on these people to unseat the ruling party. “At the 11th hour to elections, you see them (opposition parties) moving to the ruling party or main opposition, telling them they want to work with them, thereby endorsing those parties for peanuts.” Ajayi told opposition to work hard in order to earn respect. He said if there will be any alliance later, it should not be on monetary bases, but on appointments. “In some states where this alliance is necessary, the opposition are given appointments, but in Lagos the party they endorse pays them off.” He urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to be neutral to all parties and candidates to deepen the nation’s democracy.

Evicted Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemate, Kaisha, has predicted that Laycon will emerge winner of the ‘Lockdown’ season. Kaisha, who had earlier said she wanted Dorathy to win the show, said her mind changed upon watching the show from home. According to her, although Dorathy is consistent and real, Laycon has more fans. “Based on when I was in the house I felt like Dorathy will win. Dorathy was someone that was real, from day one she didn’t change. “This is a reality show and she was consistent in being the Dorathy that I know so, I felt like she should win, but when I got evicted and saw the ‘Icons’, I realized that Laycon is really giving them hot outside. I think he will win.” Laycon’s fans are popularly called the ‘Icons’. See Video: “I thought Dorathy was going to win when I was in the house, but coming out to see ICONS changed my mind. Laycon is winning this year.” – Kaisha Icons, una dey intimidate sha. 😊#LayconNeedsYou#BBNaija #TVC pic.twitter.com/C39TNECpsr — BBNaijaFacts (@BBNaijafacts) August 31, 2020

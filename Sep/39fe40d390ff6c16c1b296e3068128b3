Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, wants to build the team’s midfield around Lyon’s Houssem Aouar, according to ESPN. The 22-year-old has become one of the best young midfield prospects in Europe, following his performances for the Ligue 1 outfit. Aouar has attracted interest from Juventus, Real Madrid and Manchester City. But Arsenal have made the Frenchman their priority target this summer window. Arteta views Aouar as a key part of the midfield trio he plans to use in a 4-3-3 system with Arsenal. The Gunners had already gone for Aouar which was rejected by Lyon, after they offered cash plus Matteo Guendouzi. Lyon are not interested in a deal that includes Guendouzi and are demanding a €60 million (£55.5m) fee.

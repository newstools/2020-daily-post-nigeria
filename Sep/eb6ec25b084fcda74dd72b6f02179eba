The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the Ondo governorship election, Eyitayo Jegede, has revealed why he did not pick the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, as his running mate. Agboola had defected to the PDP from the All Progressives Congress (APC) in a bid to secure a governorship ticket, but lost out to Jegede in the primaries. The Deputy governor eventually left PDP for Zenith Labour Party (ZLP), where he emerged as the flagbearer. Many observers had expected Jegede and Ajayi to team up against the APC candidate and incumbent Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu. But Jegede announced Gboluga Ikengboju as his running mate. Speaking on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily, Jegede said, “Ajayi chose not to be my deputy. His ambition is to be a governor under a political party. He left the APC, came to PDP, defeated in our primary, and went to ZLP. “I took opinions from virtually everybody. People chose who became my running mate. When a choice is made we must respect it. One should not allow his ambition to override the choice of the people. “All the policies that we are fighting, the pains we want to end are the product of Akeredolu and his deputy. He was in our party (as a member) for just six weeks. He is a very powerful person and humble, you cannot do away with that.”

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Ozo, on Sunday, attempted to kiss Nengi after he was evicted from the show. Ozo was evicted after Trikytee exited the reality television show. When the anchor of the show, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu announced Ozo’s eviction, he hugged Nengi and attempted to kiss the BBNaija housemate. Nengi, however, dogged Ozo’s turned it down but rather hugged him tightly. The current BBNaija Head of House also broke down in tears as Ozo walked out of the house. Watch video here… I always knew Ozo will try to kiss Nengi, lmao Ozo.
But Vee’s expression tho#BBNaija so Nengi

To boost the state’s internally generated revenues (IGR), the Bauchi State government has expressed its total commitment to harness other sectors of the economy for sustainable development. This was disclosed on Tuesday by the state Commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning, Dr Aminu Hassan Gamawa, at a stakeholders engagement on diversification of Bauchi State economy. According to the commissioner, the stakeholder’s engagement was meant to deliberate on how to identify areas capable of contributing to the economic growth of the state. According to Gamawa, who was represented by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Alhaji Yahuza Adamu, Bauchi State has a lot of economic potentials, particularly in the areas of tourism, agriculture and solid minerals, waiting to be harnessed. He submitted that the state cannot continue to rely on monthly allocations from the Federation Account. The commissioner informed that it was in view of this that the state is collaborating with the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) to look at other sources of revenues. “The whole essence of this interactive session is on economic diversification as it will not be good for us to continue relying on the federation account. “We are now collaborating with the Revenue Mobilization Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) to look inward in harnessing other sources of revenue generation because we have a lot of economic opportunities in Bauchi State especially in the areas of tourism, agriculture and solid minerals,” the commissioner said. He then assured stakeholders that the state government under the leadership of Governor Bala Mohammed is ready to provide the enabling environment for private sector participation in the state’s economic diversification bid.

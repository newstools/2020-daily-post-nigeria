The host of the Big Brother Naija reality show, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, has warned the remaining Lockdown housemates ahead of the final week. Nengi, Ozo, Vee, Dorothy and Neo are the final five contestants left on the show. Trikytee and Ozo were evicted on Sunday. After the evictions were over, Ebuka took time to advise the housemates to be careful. “Some housemates will want to trigger or trip you up this week, so they can put you in trouble and win the prize. “Be patient and enjoy your week.” The ultimate winner of this year’s competition will win N85m.

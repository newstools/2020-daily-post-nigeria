Disqualified Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Erica has said Kiddwaya played a role in her getting strikes. Recall that Erica was issued first strike for whispering with Kiddwaya. Her third strike on Sunday for flouting house rules got her disqualified from the show. Erica in an interview with Africa Magic on Monday said she thinks Kiddwaya played a role in her getting strikes in the house but it’s also her responsibility. “I don’t think Kiddwaya feels the same way I do about it but I don’t care about that. “I think Kiddwaya played a role in me getting strikes but it is still my responsibility. “I also played a role in him getting strikes too,” she said. Erica is out and shinning! 😊 #bbnaija pic.twitter.com/1iReGHpcAA — Truetalk9ja1 (@Truetalk9ja1) September 7, 2020

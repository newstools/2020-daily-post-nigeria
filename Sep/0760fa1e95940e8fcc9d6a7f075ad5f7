Kidnappers have abducted three children of Zamfara State Sub-treasurer, Alhaji Yusuf Marafa. His neighbour in Nahuche community of the Bungudu Local Government Area of the State, was equally killed in the process. According to insiders, the kidnapped children are Mansur Yusuf, Sa ’adu Yusuf and Anas Yusuf, while his neighbour, Malam Kamalu Nahuche was shot dead by the notorious armed bandits. One indigene of the area who identified himself as Alhaji Dahiru, told DAILY POST that the kidnappers, who were on many motorcycles, drove into the community and went straight to the sub-treasurer’s house, where they whisked away the three children. His neighbour, Kamalu, was reportedly shot dead as he came out of his house. Dahiru narrated that the bandits had also entered into the house of one Ibrahim Maishago, who is a businessman, in an attempt to kidnap his children. “They discovered some large sum of money in the house, which they took away with them along with the children,” he said.

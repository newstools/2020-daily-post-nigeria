Former Arsenal defender, Sol Campbell, has said the club has a “good chance” of finishing in the Premier League top four this season. This follows their 3-0 victory over Fulham at Craven Cottage on Saturday. Alexandre Lacazette scored the first goal of the season for the second time, before Gabriel Magalhaes doubled their advantage with a bullet header. Captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang rounded off scoring with a stunning finish inside the box. Arsenal finished eighth last season, but Campbell feels they can climb further up the table this time around. He told Premier League productions: “I’m more optimistic [about that now] because if they can carry on like this and grow with confidence and the new players settle in, then why not? “Yes, there are other teams in there who have invested a lot of money and are vying for those positions. “But I think if they can carry on like they were at the end of this season and today then they have a good chance.”

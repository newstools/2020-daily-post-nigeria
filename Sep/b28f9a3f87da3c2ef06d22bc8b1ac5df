Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Neo has warned Vee to minimize touching him because it gets him in the mood. Neo said this during a conversation with Vee on Thursday night at the dinning. Vee was rubbing Neo’s hands while conversing but the Delta born cautioned her. He said, “You are gorgeous, I am beggining to struggle now. Your touches and kisses set this thing in the mood lately and standing tall.” The couple have promised not to have sex while in the house. Vee had last week said she was eager to have sex with her lover, Neo. She told Laycon that she cannot wait to have sex with Neo. Vee said, “Neo is the first person I will have sex with when I leave the house.”

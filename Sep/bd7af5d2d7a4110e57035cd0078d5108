Manchester United stars, Mason Greenwood and Brandon Williams have been given new jersey numbers at the Red Devils. Greenwood previously wore the No.26 shirt in the 2019/20 campaign, while Williams wore No.53 shirt. The striker will now wear the No.11 shirt for Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s side for the 2020-21 season, while the left-back will wear the No. 33 shirt. Man United made this known in a post via its official website on Friday. Greenwood and Williams were both impressive for Man United last season as the Old Trafford club finished in the third position on the Premier League table ahead of Chelsea (fourth position). Greenwood and Williams will now hope to feature for Man United when they take on Crystal Palace on 19 September in their first Premier League fixture.

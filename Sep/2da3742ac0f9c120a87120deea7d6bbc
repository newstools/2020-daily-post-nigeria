The police in Ogun State said they have arrested two herdsmen, for allegedly robbing and defiling a teenager. The suspects were identified by the police as Abu Adamu and Muhammadu Aliyu. A statement by DSP Abimbola Oyeyemi, the State Police Public Relations Officer, on Sunday, revealed that the suspects were arrested after a distress call received by the police at Ewekoro Divisional Headquarters at about 1am. Oyeyemi said the armed herdsmen had invaded a farm settlement at Afowowa Gbelu village in Ewekoro, attacking a family residing in the farm settlement. According to him, the suspects ransacked the house of one Aminat Okeshola and made away with cash of N140,000. After this, they were said to have taken a 16-year-old daughter of the family to the cassava plantation and took turns to defile her. DAILY POST learnt that policemen from Ewekoro division went to the farm settlement, combed the entire area and arrested two of the suspects who hid in a nearby bush at the sight of the policemen. The third suspect with them reportedly escaped. “The two arrested suspects were immediately identified by the victims,” Oyeyemi said. “Preliminary investigation revealed that the herdsmen have always been passing through the farm settlement with their cattle in the day time before they came back to strike on the fateful day,” he said. The Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, DAILY POST reports, has ordered that the fleeing member of the gang be hunted and the case be transferred to the State CIID for investigation and prosecution.

Rochas Okorocha, the Imo West Senator, has said the people of Edo State revolted against injustice during the just concluded governorship election. Okorocha made the remark in response to the reelection of the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. Speaking with journalists yesterday, the former Governor of Imo State recalled warning of a possible implosion in the party if the leadership of the All Progressives Congress, APC, failed to address some issues threatening the party’s sustenance. Okorocha: “I will not congratulate the PDP, I will congratulate the Edo people. I congratulate them for standing up against injustice because the people that voted for Obaseki are not only PDP, even people in the APC voted for him. “They want to stand up for injustice, Edo people are not docile, they know what they want and how they want it.” Recall that Obaseki had defeated the APC’s governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu over the weekend.

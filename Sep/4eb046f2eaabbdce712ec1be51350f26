The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has released a flight schedule, as international flights begin Saturday, September 5. In a memo signed by the Director-General of the agency, Musa Nuhu, it was noted that incoming flights are only permitted to carry a maximum of 200 passengers. Nuhu, however, confirmed “there is no limit” on the number of outgoing passengers. “Kindly note due to the limited number of approved incoming passengers (1,280) allowed daily per each airport, it is not possible to accommodate the requested schedule of airlines. “Each operator has only one frequency on an approved day of operation irrespective of the capacity of aircraft utilised,” it read. The approved airlines for international flight schedule include Turkish Airlines, Air Senegal, Virgin Atlantic, Qatar, Africa World Airlines (AWA) Ghana for the Lagos and Abuja airports. Others include Emirates, British Airways, Ethiopian, Asky, Air Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt Air, Delta, Middle East and Kenya Airways. Here is the flight schedule released by the NCAA.

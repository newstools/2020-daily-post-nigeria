Salihu Tanko Yakasai, the media aide to Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has admitted that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has lost the Edo governorship election. Governor Godwin Obaseki is currently leading with over 80,000 votes in the official results posted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Yakasai, in a Twitter post, said the defeat provides “important lessons” to APC as a party. He also warned the ruling party to do “some soul searching for our survival”. “The outcome of #EdoElection has some important lessons for APC as a party, not just in Edo but equally at the centre. “But most importantly, the outcome has some insights into the future of the party as well. Let’s look inwards and outwards and do some soul searching for our survival,” Yakasai wrote.

The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, National Youth Frontiers on Thursday threatened a nationwide protest against the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government. National Coordinator of the group, Usman Austin Okai, disclosed that the planned protest was due to the increase in the pump price of petrol. In a statement he issued after a meeting with members, Okai warned that the group would go ahead with the protest if the new price of petrol was not reversed. Okai lamented that the new price was aimed at shortchanging the poor in society. “The increase in the pump price of petroleum products, always has multiplier effects on the living standard of ordinary Nigerians, without commensurate adjustment of workers’ salaries and allowances, saying this is capable of creating uneasy calm in the country. We are mobilising for a nationwide strike. ”

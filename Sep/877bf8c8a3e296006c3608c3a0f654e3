The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has said that Nigerians must dwell in unity, if the country must become great. Tinubu stated this on Saturday, when he paid a condolence visit to Senator Aliyu Wamakko, on the death of his daughter, Sadiya Aliyu. “We have to unite to develop our country. The blood that runs in my veins is the same blood that runs in every Nigerian vein. “Whether I am Yoruba and you are Fulani, Hausa or Igbo, the essence of our life is that we are Nigerians. “Therefore, we should always dwell and take Nigeria first in everything we do for the good of our country,” he said. His remarks come amid comments from former president, Olusegun Obasanjo, stating that Nigeria is becoming a failed state and divided under President Muhammadu. Obasanjo also claimed the country needs to be rescued from the brink of collapse.

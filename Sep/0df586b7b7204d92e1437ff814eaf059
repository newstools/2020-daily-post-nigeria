Ba N’Daou, Mali’s former Defence Minister, has been named as President of the transition government. Coup leader, Colonel Assimi Goita, has been appointed Vice President. The state television made the announcement on Monday. N’Daou will be in office until the election of a new civilian government. Goita heads the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP). He led soldiers to remove President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on August 18. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had warned the military to appoint a civilian leader or face additional sanctions. ECOWAS had imposed border closure on Mali. The regional body also suspended financial flows in the country.

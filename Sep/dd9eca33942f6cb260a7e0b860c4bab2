Maverick entertainer, Charles Oputa, popularly known as Charlyboy, has reacted to Pastor David Ibiyeomie’s attack on a popular On Air Personality (OAP), Daddy Freeze. Charly Boy took to his official Instagram account on Monday to condemn Ibiyeomie’s threats to kill Freeze. He also warned that If Ibiyeomie has decided to make Freeze a topic, he will make the pastor his ‘assignment’. It all started when Freeze criticized Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church for saying women should submit to their husbands. Reacting, Ibiyeomie called the media personality a bastard, threatening to kill him. In a viral video from his Sunday service, the Port Harcourt-based Pastor threatened to deal with Freeze. He also cursed the day the OAP was born. And reacting to this, Charly Boy, wrote: “Look at these Con Men Of God. “So pastor Ibiyeome is saying that The Chief Racketeer, Pastor Oyedepo can’t make mistakes because he’s all-knowing? “Even in the house of worship calling my anointed Daddy Freeze a Bastard? “Pastor Ibiyeome, Who is your father? “Were you not born on the express road because that is where most accidents happen. Is Oyedepo man or God? “I know you have your head far into Oyedepo’s ass that you cannot see or hear clearly any more. “If you decide to make Daddy Freeze a topic, I will make you my Assignment. “God punish useless fake Pastors.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-837958" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/charlie-boy.jpg" alt="" width="905" height="495" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/charlie-boy.jpg 905w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/charlie-boy-300x164.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 905px) 100vw, 905px">

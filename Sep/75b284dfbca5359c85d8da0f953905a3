The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has declared that killing a Kano-based singer, Yahaya Sharif for blasphemy in one of his songs will clearly show that Nigeria is being ruled by a terrorist. He appealed with the governor of Kano State, Umar Ganduje to temper justice with mercy. Recall that Ayodele had previously warned against the killing of the Kano-based musician, Sharif-Aminu. According to him, killing the singer will amount to spilling blood of the innocent. In another statement to DAILY POST on Friday, the cleric added, “I am still begging, killing of Yahaya Sharif will mean we have a terrorist ruling us, I will advise the governor of Kano not to attest to this. If he does, it means he isn’t a good man. He should forget about religion. He needs to temper justice with mercy, he needs to forgive this young man. “We are serving the same God in a different way, I’m begging that he should be forgiven. ”He is a star, he has a mission on earth, killing him means killing the hope of those he will help tomorrow. He should be forgiven.’’

John Oyegun, former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has congratulated Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State over his reelection. Oyegun said Obaseki’s victory was an indication that egocentric politicking could be overcome in Nigeria. A statement he signed, however, stressed that Obaseki’s victory at the just concluded election has put more responsibilities on his shoulders. Obaseki, who was the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had emerged winner of the Saturday’s governorship after polling the highest number of votes. However, the former APC National Chairman said, “Please accept my deepest congratulations, Mr. Governor on your re-election as Governor of our great Edo State. “You and your exemplary Deputy have shown that with good work and principled leadership, the ills of overbearing and egocentric politicking in our nation can be overcome. “Your very significant victory marks a watershed in Edo and indeed Nigerian politics and so places additional responsibilities on your shoulders. “I wish you and your Deputy four more years of inspired and productive leadership of our people who have reposed so much confidence in you.”

The Chairman, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Governor’s Forum, Aminu Tambuwal, has expressed worry over the fire which engulfed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Headquarters, in Akure ahead of the October Ondo governorship election. DAILY POST reports that over 5000 card readers were destroyed in the inferno, which engulfed the ICT unit of the commission on Thursday. Tambuwal, during the Ondo PDP campaign flag-off on Saturday, said the party suspected foul play from the All Progressives Congress, APC, in order to rig the poll. The Sokoto State Governor said the PDP will not allow the APC to rig the opposition party out of the Ondo election. Tambuwal, therefore, called on INEC to investigate the fire incident. The Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, who doubles as the chairman of the Ondo PDP campaign committee, on his part, described the forthcoming election as a poll to rescue the state from servitude. In his words, “Eyitayo Jegede, the candidate of the party is a saviour of the state. We want freedom for the entire southwest. Ondo people must replicate what was done by the Oyo people. We were not in power at the center, state and at the local government but we won with the support of the people.” The candidate of the party in the October gubernatorial election, Eyitayo Jegede, said the campaign is a notice to the state ruling party and sign for a new face in the state government house. He promised the people the state to grow the economy of the state, create jobs for youths, reduce school fees and ensure good healthcare.

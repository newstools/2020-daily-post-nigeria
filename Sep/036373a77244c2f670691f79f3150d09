Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has admitted he is disappointed that Cote d’Ivoire has withdrawn from next month’s friendly match. Rohr, speaking to NationSport, however, noted that their replacement, Algeria is a worthy opponent. The Elephants were initially scheduled to face Nigeria on October 9 in Austria. But the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) confirmed last week that their West African neighbours pulled out of the encounter due to internal problems. “Of course, we have Algeria now but I regretted that we are not going to play Cote d’Ivoire again because we had planned to play at least a game against a Black African team. “But now we have to play against two Maghreb teams; unfortunately we don’t have Maghreb teams not for the AFCON qualifiers and not for the Qatar 2022 World Cup too. “But it’s okay because it was very difficult (to get a replacement) in the last moments to replace the Ivory Coast team,” Rohr said.

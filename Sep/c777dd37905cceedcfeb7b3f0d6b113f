Following incessant killing by ‘one way’ drivers in Lagos State, the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu, has vowed that the command would not relent in enforcing traffic rules. He threatened that anybody caught driving against traffic (taking one way) would be severely dealt with, as he warned drivers and okada riders to desist from plying restricted routes and illegal use of the BRT lanes across the State. The Police boss gave the warning during an emergency meeting on the enforcement order with the 14 Area Commanders and Heads of Department in the command at the Conference Room, State Headquarters, GRA Ikeja. Odumosu also ordered the Area Commanders to form Taskforce in their respective commands, which should comprise the Police and other security agencies, to enforce the orders and arrest any violator for immediate prosecution. He appealed to Lagosians to obey traffic rules, saying their compliance would assist tremendously in managing the traffic situation in the State, while charging all traffic management agencies to be proactive in enforcing the traffic rules.

Thiago Alcantara has been told by Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti, that he joined the wrong team. The Spain midfielder and Ancelotti worked together at Bayern Munich during the 2016/2017 season. The 29-year-old has now signed for Everton’s Merseyside rivals, Liverpool, after winning the Champions League with Bayern. “Breaks my heart, breaks my heart,” Ancelotti told the Echo. “The only good thing about this signing is that he is a neighbour and that’s it. I think he chose the wrong team. “He could choose the blue team, not the red team. I am joking. He is a fantastic player and my friend, Jurgen, will be happy.”

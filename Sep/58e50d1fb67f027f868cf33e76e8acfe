Burna Boy has supported Rema after the “Iron Man” singer had an emotional breakdown on Twitter. Rema in a series of tweets touched a number of topics ranging from critics, management issues, fake love and rejection from girls and friends. His tweets raised eyebrows and questions on social media about his relationship with his music label, Mavin. However, Burna Boy who has been away from Twitter in his reaction to Rema’s tweet encouraged and hailed him for being real. “I’m so happy I had to come back on Twitter for two minutes. Big up Rema for real bro, you really made my day. I dey for you officially,” his tweet read. Burna Boy quoting one of Rema’s tweets in which he talked about how some friends left after his brother’s death said that his revelations warmed his heart and proved that he is a real man. “It’s not too often (probably never) that an artiste from Nigeria says something so real that a ni**a like me can relate to. “It warms my heart to see that there is still a place for real Ni**az in this weird world where lies are the new truth and spoilt kids and people who have never even been in a real fist fight in their lives are the new ‘Real Ni**az” He further advised Rema not to change, adding that he is one of the young artists he mentions when asked for new artists to look out for. “You are one of the last of a dying breed. Don’t ever let them break you or change you. “Since I heard his music, his name has been one of the names I have mentioned when asked what new artists to look out for. Check my interviews,” Burna Boy added. Recall that Rema’s hit single “Iron Man” was featured on former US president, Barack Obama’s 2019 summer playlist. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-844066 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_9242-633x1024.jpg" alt="" width="633" height="1024" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_9242-633x1024.jpg 633w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_9242-185x300.jpg 185w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_9242.jpg 828w" sizes="(max-width: 633px) 100vw, 633px">

Oghenekaro Etebo has moved to Galatasaray, where he will spend the 2020/2021 season on loan from Stoke City. This means that the Etebo will not link up with fellow Nigerian midfielder, John Mikel Obi, at the Bet365 Stadium. Etebo signed for the Potters before the 2018 World Cup in Russia. The 24-year-old made 45 appearances for the Championship side, before heading on loan to LaLiga outfit Getafe in January. Mikel Obi joined Stoke this summer as a free agent. The former Super Eagles captain, now 33, last played for Turkish Super Lig club Trabzonspor, where his contract was cancelled amid the COVID-19 outbreak. Mikel is gradually settling in at the club, having featured in their pre-season friendly fixtures against Leeds United, Shrewsbury Town and Newcastle United.

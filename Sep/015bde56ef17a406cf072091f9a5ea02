The Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has alleged foul play in the just-concluded governorship election in the state. It, however, called on party members to stay calm while party leaders study the result and decide what is next. In a statement sent to DAILY POST by the Chairman of the APC Media Campaign Council, John Mayaki, the party rejected the result of the just-concluded governorship election. Mayaki alleged strong-arm tactics in the Saturday’s governorship election. According to Mayaki: “Our people were arbitrarily arrested, many of the figures were fabricated. “Areas where we won, they cancelled them. They decreased the votes in areas we had advantage. “They rejected our results and jerked up theirs.” Mayaki also alleged that there was an arbitrary arrest of local party members, who could have resisted the outrage, while the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki was busy allegedly “diverting attention with false alarm.” “Obaseki shouted that he was being rigged out and blamed INEC at the initial stage but that was to divert attention from the evil going on in the field”, the statement said.

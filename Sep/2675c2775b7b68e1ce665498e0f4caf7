Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has provided the latest update on midfielder, Paul Pogba, ahead of his side’s pre-season friendly clash against Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon at Villa Park. Pogba returned to Man United training earlier this week after recovering from COVID-19 infection. The Frenchman also remains a doubt for Man United’s Premier League opener against Crystal Palace on Saturday 19 September. Providing an update on Pogba, Solskjaer told MUTV on Friday, “Paul’s had a couple of training sessions, so he is lost out on a few sessions because of the virus, of course. “But Paul is quick to get fit. Of course, he worked really hard to get back after lockdown last time and played the majority of the games. “Hopefully, he’ll be ready for next weekend. I am not 100 percent sure, though.”

He warned rapists and people who take delight in defiling minors that this singular behaviour contravenes the extant laws of the land and against humanity. “The Command is not unmindful of the challenges attributed to the last quarter of the calendar called Ember months and wish to passionately solicit collaborative participation in crime prevention through Community Policing strategy. “Residents are hereby assured of safety, advised to make conscientious efforts in studying their environments and report possible dangers, suspected movement and other criminal activities to the Police for proactive measures at all times” he stated.

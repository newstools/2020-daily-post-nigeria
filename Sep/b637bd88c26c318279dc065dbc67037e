Atletico Madrid midfielder, Thomas Partey, wants to move to Arsenal, according to Goal. The 27-year-old Ghana international has become a mainstay in Diego Simeone’s side. But he can leave the Wanda Metropolitano if his £44million release clause is triggered. Partey’s current contract expires in 2023, but Atletico may be forced to sell due to the financial impact of COVID-19. The LaLiga club have to make sales and would not be able to offer the player a more lucrative extension to his deal. The Gunners are believed to be also keen on Partey and reportedly offered striker Alexandre Lacazette in a swap deal. However, Atletico want full payment for Partey.

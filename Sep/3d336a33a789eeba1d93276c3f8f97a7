The Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has conceded to the demands of the organized Labour in Nigeria over the welfare of public servants in the State. The Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC and the Trade Union Congress, TUC, had in conjunction with allied unions planned a major demonstration against Wike’s government The demonstration will be swiftly followed by a strike today, Tuesday 8th September, according to the NLC President Comrade Ayuba Wabba, and Comrade Quadri Olaleye of the TUC. But on the eve of the protest the Rivers State Governor entered a closed-door meeting with the labour leaders where DAILY POST gathered that some agreements have been reached. In a joint resolution signed by representatives of the Rivers State government and Labour, both parties agreed to sign the agreement on the implementation of the new National Minimum wage and consequential adjustments. “The NLC Secretariat which was sealed for the correction of structural defects will be immediately unsealed while the government continues the correction work. “The Rivers State government shall immediately commence the remittances of check-out dues and pay all the outstanding arrears to the respective Labour Unions. “Rivers State government commits to the payments of the salaries to the health workers due to the strike action of 2017. “Organised Labour agrees to immediately suspend the planned protest scheduled for Tuesday September 8, 2020,” the agreement read.

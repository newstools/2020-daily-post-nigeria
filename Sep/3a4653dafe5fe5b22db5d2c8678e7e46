The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) says Lagos-Ogun Mass Transit Train Services operations will resume next Monday. Operations were suspended in March after the outbreak of coronavirus. Jerry Oche, NRC Lagos District Manager, made the announcement in a statement on Thursday. “NRC is set to resume its Mass Transit Train Services on Monday, September 14, 2020. The resumption is coming after a compulsory shutdown of train operations on March 23, 2020 due to the novel coronavirus outbreak.” He said in line with Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) guidelines for the reopening of rail transportation, changes have been made. “Our MTTS would now cost N460 flat per trip and the trains would no longer stop at some stations.” Before now, fares between Iddo in Lagos and Ijoko/Kajola in Ogun was N230 per trip. Trains originating from Ijoko will only stop at Ebute Metta Junction and Iddo stations, while return trains originating from Iddo would terminate at Ijoko only. Trains from Iddo used to stop at Ebute Metta, Yaba, Mushin, Oshodi, Sogunle, Agege, Iju, Agbado, Itoki, Opo Suuru, Ijoko and terminated at Kajola. “It is to be noted that the MTT train would leave Ijoko by 6.30 am and Iddo by 17.30 pm. In strict adherence to NCDC’s guidelines for public engagement, no passengers would be allowed to board the train without a face mask and hand sanitiser.” On social distancing measures, NRC stated that seats marked ‘X’ are NOT to be sit on. Also, standing or hanging on the train will not be allowed.

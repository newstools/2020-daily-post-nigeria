Nicholas Afel, Acting District Head of Kamuru-Ikulu in Zango-Kataf Local Government, Kaduna State, has alerted of rising insecurity in his domain. The traditional leader said murder and kidnapping have been on the increase recently. He spoke on Thursday during a medical outreach organised by the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) in the community. Afel complained that Kamuru-Ikulu doesn’t have a police station. He said the military personnel posted there were grossly inadequate. “Our people are being kidnapped and killed on daily basis. We are suffering and losing our people because of the high level of insecurity. This is a very serious problem for us. “As I speak, we don’t have a police station and the few military men posted here are inadequate. We call on the federal and state governments to come to our aid,” NAN quoted him as saying.

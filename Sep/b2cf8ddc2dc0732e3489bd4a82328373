A coalition of activists from 54 Commonwealth nations has faulted a report of alleged unfolding genocide in Nigeria. The coalition, under the aegis of Commonwealth Activists United Kingdom, UK, said the declaratory assertion by the UK All-Party Parliamentary Group could create fresh problems for a country that is dealing with problems it did not create. They stated this during a protest at the United Kingdom Parliament, Westminster London, on Tuesday. This was contained in a letter signed by its President, Hameed Williams and sent to Rehman Chishti, Special Envoy for Freedom of Religion or Belief, House of Commons. According to the activists, the activists said APPG’s report is a deliberate falsehood to destabilize Nigeria along sectarian lines. It described the report as mischievous aimed at tarnishing the image of Nigeria before the international community. The coalition stressed that some aspects of human relationships were not captured in the report by APPG. According to the letter: “There are many news stories that detailed how the military is combating terrorists and arresting those involved in attacks and communities but the APPG Report mischievously avoided reflecting this aspect of the situation in Nigeria. “We also see a deliberate exploitation of Nigerian dead citizens from terrorism related incidents by mischaracterizing their demise as the product of a Christian massacre when the truth is that Nigerians – Christian, Muslims, animists, agnostics, atheists and persons of other creeds – are being killed under circumstances in which the United Kingdom is complicit. This should not be the case in a civilized world. We condemn every single instance of a human life being unjustly taken as we condemn the dislocation of families and communities for any reason.”

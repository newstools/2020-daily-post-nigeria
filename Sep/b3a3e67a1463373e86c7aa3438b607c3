Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has been commended on infrastructural development in spite of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the world. An Ibadan-based property expert, Akeem Olayinka-Martins, spoke at a press conference on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the Real Estate industry in Nigeria. Olayinka-Martins described the ongoing projects of the administration as “highly impactful”. He listed N2.9billion Moniya/Iseyin road, Phase 2 light up project, completion of the 12.5 km abandoned Akala road, and the N5.5billion renovation of Lekan Salami stadium. Others are the 21 km Airport road, 44 kilometres Saki-Igboho road, Under G stadium-Lautech Gate road, Ogbomosho and Takie-FGGC roads. Olayinka-Martins stressed that Makinde’s achievements in 16 months affirm the sincerity with which he was running Oyo affairs. “It confirms that he came to office with the zeal to implement programmes that would alleviate the suffering of the people and equitably distribute dividends of democracy.” Speaking further, the renowned facility manager called for increased patronage of local contractors. “We are unanimous in our call on the state government to increase patronage of local practitioners. We have also been adversely affected by the lockdown caused by coronavirus”, Olayinka-Martins said.

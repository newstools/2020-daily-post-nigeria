Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Nengi has called off her friendship with Ozo. Nengi took her stand on Sunday morning after her argument with Ozo. It all started during the party when Ozo made advances to Nengi again and told her he loves her. But Nengi who was not having it easy with him bluntly told him to “keep his stupid love.” Speaking also after the party, Nengi told Ozo she cannot be friends with him anymore. According to her, she cannot be friends with someone who gets upset over food. Nengi said: “I don’t want to talk to you again. I don’t want to be friends with you. “How would you get upset over meat? “I don’t know what will happen outside but for the period we are in this house, I don’t want to talk to you.”

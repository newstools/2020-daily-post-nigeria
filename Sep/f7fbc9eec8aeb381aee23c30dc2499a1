The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Command, Hakeem Odumosu, has instructed operatives to disallow societies, under whatever disguise, from staging rallies or protests on October 1. He read the riot act on Wednesday during a security meeting with the Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and Heads of Department at the State Headquarters in Ikeja. Odumosu warned that the command will not allow gatherings against the sovereignty of Nigeria. The Police boss warned parents and guardians to warn their children and wards to stay away from demonstrations against the federal government. “Anyone arrested for such actions will be prosecuted”, the commissioner warned. He appealed to the public to be law-abiding and desist from acts capable of disrupting the sovereignty of the nation. Deputy Inspector-General of Police, Information and Communication Technology, Celestine Okoye, on behalf of the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, told police officers to maintain law and order in Lagos and repel forces that can disintegrate Nigeria.

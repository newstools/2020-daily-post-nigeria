Popular Nollywood actress, Lala Akindoju has reacted to Pastor David Ibiyeomie’s attack on controversial media personality, Daddy Freeze. Ibiyeomie had called Daddy Freeze a bastard, threatening to deal with him for criticising Bishop David Oyedepo of Winners Chapel. In a viral video from his Sunday service, the Port Harcourt-based Pastor also cursed the day the OAP was born. His statement has since stirred reactions from Nigerians. Reacting on her Twitter page, Lala Akindoju berated Pastor Ibiyomie for his statement, adding that he misrepresented Christians and the gospel of Christ with his actions. She further advised Nigerians to know God for themselves and don’t get blinded by ‘religion’. Her tweet read: “Meanwhile I just watched the video of that pastor. It is wrong, SO WRONG! First as a supposed Christian, then as leader and finally as human being. I’m even more shocked at the congregation echoing the insults. “Please that is not what the Bible preaches, this is why it is important to know God for yourself, read your bible yourself and don’t get blinded by religion. “I am very ashamed of him only because he has misrepresented the gospel of Jesus. Proverbs 18 is a good scripture to meditate on today.”

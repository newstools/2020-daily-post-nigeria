Suarez was spotted crying in his car after he attended his last training session with Barcelona, Evening Standard reports. The 33-year-old looked visibly emotional as he left Barcelona‚Äôs Ciutat Desportiva Joan Gamper training complex, holding up a hand to bid farewell as he drove off in his black Range Rover Sport.

Nigerian defender, William Troost-Ekong, has completed a permanent transfer to Watford. The Hornets announced his signing in an official statement on Tuesday. The 27-year-old, who has 42 caps for the Super Eagles, represented his country at the 2018 World Cup. Troost-Ekong has signed a five-year contract with Watford and becomes the latest addition to Vladimir Ivić’s squad. He spent the past two years in Italy with Udinese, playing 66 times for the Serie A side after joining from Turkish Süper Lig outfit Bursaspor in 2018. “A former Netherlands youth international, Troost-Ekong made his senior international debut for Nigeria in 2015 and has since proven himself to be an important part of the Super Eagles’ defence, playing three times at the World Cup in Russia and making six appearances at last year’s African Cup of Nations in Egypt. “He will wear squad number 5,” the statement added.

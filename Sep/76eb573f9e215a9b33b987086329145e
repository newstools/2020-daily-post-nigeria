Paris Saint-Germain forward, Kylian Mbappe, has warned the club that they must spend money on new players, if they are to bounce back from their Champions League heartbreak next season. Mbappe played in their 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in last month’s final. And while his fellow forward Neymar has pledged to stay with the Ligue 1 champions for at least another season, Mbappe feels fresh additions are needed to mount another serious challenge. “Of course I am optimistic that we will win the Champions League. We have to because, if we don’t believe it, no one is going to believe it for us,” Mbappe told Telefoot . “It’s football and you have to get over it. Lots of teams lost a final and won the year after. Obviously, PSG grew up with this final. Before, we had this block of the quarter-finals, now we broke that. “You have to recruit well, you have to buy players. I hope we will have good recruits and that we can restart the season with the aim of doing better.”

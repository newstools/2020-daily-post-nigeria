Suspected hoodlums and land-grabbers invaded Isiu palace on Sunday in Ikorodu, Lagos State in a failed attempt to abduct the newly-installed monarch following sporadic gunshots at the premises. NAN reports that Oba Okukayode Raji was given the staff of office by Wale Ahmed, the Lagos State Commissioner for Special Duties, on August 24, 2020. Raji told NAN that the hoodlums came in dozens with dangerous weapons before the intervention of local vigilante groups that averted their evil plots and chased them away. The monarch said: “Suddenly, we started seeing strange faces and many boys coming closer to the palace with different weapons in their hands. “While they moved closer, they started shooting; one of my sons was wounded in the process. “My house, my car and many people who came to pay homage to me were also wounded. “More than 60 people were shot, those who sustained serious injuries have been taken to the hospital for treatment.” Raji explained that he contacted the Area Commander and the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) for help. “They responded very late but later sent their officers to patrol the community,” he said. “However, three suspects have been arrested so far.” Raji, however, urged community leaders and indigenes to cooperate and solve land matters themselves to ensure absolute peace within the communities.

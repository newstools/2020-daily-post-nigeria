Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State; Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and Seyi Makinde of Oyo State have commended the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, and security agencies ahead of the announcement of the Edo State governorship election result. The PDP Governors also called on the various stakeholders in the election to ensure the collation centres are secured. They addressed reporters in Benin City, the Edo State capital on Saturday, during the governorship election. The Governor commended INEC and those in charge of security for conducting what they described as a peaceful election in the state. Meanwhile, Obaseki on Saturday defeated Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the APC in Oredo Local Government Area of the state. “The Edo election has been quite peaceful and I want to commend everybody for the peace we have enjoyed,” Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, to Governor Obaseki, Crusoe Osagie, quoted Wike as saying. Wike, however, said he believes that problems do not arise at the election but during collation. He then called on the electoral umpire to fulfil its promise of releasing the Edo election results at real-time. “We are very happy with the election so far. But you cannot find a security presence at the ward collation centres. After results have been announced at polling units, we expect that police presence will be more at the ward collation centres,” Wike added. Wike called on the President Muhammadu Buhari government to mobilise security agents to the various ward collation centres so that the people’s mandate can be protected

An Ikeja Magistratesâ€™ Court in Lagos on Wednesday ordered that a 41- year-old security guard, Chuks Onyebuchi, who sexually assaulted a 12-year-old girl, be remanded in a Correctional Centre. The police charged Onyebuchi with sexual assault. Magistrate O.A. Olayinka, who did not take the plea of Onyebuchi, ordered that he be remanded in Kirikiri Correctional Centre. Olayinka ordered the police to duplicate the case file and send to the Lagos State Department of Public Prosecution (DPP) for legal advice. NAN reports that Olayinka adjourned the case until Nov. 11. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, ASP Ezekiel Ayorinde prayed the court to refer the case to the DPP for legal advice. Ayorinde told the court that Onyebuchi committed the offence in March at 4.30 p.m. at his residence. The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 263 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, which attracts three years imprisonment if found guilty.

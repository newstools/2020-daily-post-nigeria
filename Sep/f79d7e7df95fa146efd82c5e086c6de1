Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya has dashed the hopes of those rooting for a relationship between him and Erica outside the house. The housemates are known as the strongest couple in the house. Erica on Wednesday night asked Kiddwaya of his plans for her outside the house. Kiddwaya responding, said he has no plans of relationship outside the house and would see her just like every other housemate. Giving reason, the billionaire son said his life at the moment is very difficult to bring girls in and that he needs to be independent before having any relationship. Kiddwaya said: “Someone can show you one side of their life, If you are smart enough you will depict the other side. I don’t want to make promises to you on what will happen outside the house. “I would see you when I’m in Lagos, we hang out with housemates. “I have my reasons for not giving you more and this is me doing what I feel is right for me and you. “There are a million guys out there for you and everyone is different “Me showing you more of my life would lead you on and I don’t want to be lying to you. Even if I show you the other side of me, you wouldn’t believe me. “My life is very difficult to bring girls in. I’m not ready because I need to be more independent. “I don’t know what future holds or fate.”

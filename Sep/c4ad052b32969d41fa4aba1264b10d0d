No fewer than forty-seven thousand (47,000) people applied for 2,000 Amotekun jobs in Oyo State. Chairman, Oyo State Security Network Agency and Amotekun Corps, General Kunle Togun, made this declaration in Ibadan on Wednesday. He spoke during the screening and verification exercise that commenced on Wednesday across the state. DAILY POST gathered that the security outfit was formed in order to complement the efforts of the police and other security agencies. Governor from the six south-western states had agreed to form the Western Nigeria Security Network also known as Amotekun in a bid to put an end to security challenges in the geopolitical zone. But Togun, while addressing journalists on Wednesday disclosed that a background check on criminal records of the applicants will also be done. He said, “Over 47,000 persons applied, while we are to take 2,000 for now. Graduates, school certificate holders and those that do not have any educational background applied. “We asked them questions on what operations they had done in the past. We want to know if they are experienced and active, what role they played in their various groups. We’ll also check to know if they have had criminal records. “Some gave incoherent information about where they came from; some did not give facts about the local government areas they claim to hail from.”

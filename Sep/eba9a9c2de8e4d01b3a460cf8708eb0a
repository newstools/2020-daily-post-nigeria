Big Brother Naija housemate, Kiddwaya, has explained why he continued being friends with Laycon, despite his alleged part in the disqualification of his love interest, Erica. Erica was asked to leave the reality show after she insulted Laycon and received a third strike two weeks ago. However, Kiddwaya and Laycon continued their bromance. During an interview on the Beat FM on Tuesday morning, Kiddwaya was asked if his friendship to Laycon amounted to disloyalty to Erica. He replied: “That would have been me being disloyal to myself because I had no issues with him. “I even asked Erica if I could call Laycon, so we sit down and talk things over. “Because I was not really the problem. My name just comes up in everything.”

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Neo has said he is ready to do anything to have Vee as his girlfriend again. Vee and Neo broke up their relationship for the second time on Saturday night. They always fought about sharing of food and minimal things. This time around, Vee insisted that she is not reconciling with him and asked that they remain friends till they leave the house. Neo, who seems not too comfortable, begged Vee on Tuesday night to take him back. According to him, “Please I need you back, I’ll do anything to have you back as my girlfriend. “I miss you asking me to do things for you, I miss us.” Vee immediately ignored him and stood up to fry plantain in the kitchen. Recall that Biggue issued Neo and Vee a strong warning on Sunday for breaking the house rules.

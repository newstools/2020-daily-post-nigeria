Barcelona are set to add Atlético Madrid to the list of clubs Luis Suarez cannot join this summer. Onda Cero reports that there is a list of ‘vetoed clubs’ already, which includes Real Madrid, Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain. Suarez has been told he has no future at the club, with Barca trying to take him off their wage bill. Nou Camp chiefs are willing to let him leave as a free agent, but are specific about teams he cannot sign for. It is believed the LaLiga giants are worried about him scoring against them for a direct rival this season. Atletico have now switched their attentions to Suarez’s international team-mate, Edinson Cavani, in case their deal for Suarez falls through in the latter stages. Suarez, meanwhile, is still in limbo and waiting to know his next club, with a move to Juventus seemingly off the cards.

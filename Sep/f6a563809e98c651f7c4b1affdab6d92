Dean Henderson has told Manchester United that he will seek a move away, if he cannot topple David de Gea as the club’s no 1 goalkeeper. Henderson has returned to Old Trafford after spending last season on loan at Sheffield United. The England keeper also recently signed a new five-year deal worth £120,000 a week. “It wouldn’t be clever for me to sit around and not play football, I don’t think it would help any parties at all. “I’m not going to improve just sitting on the bench. I need that game-time. I feel like a new signing at United. I haven’t been in the building for five years. I’ve had a lot of time away.” United will play three Premier League games before the transfer window closes on October 5 — a period which will prove decisive, as Henderson weighs up his future.

Chelsea defender, Thiago Silva, has revealed what he wants to achieve at Stamford Bridge. Silva, 35, is yet to make his Chelsea debut following his arrival from Paris Saint-Germain last month. The Brazil international has been acclimatising to life at the West London club and is clearly eager to get started for Frank Lampard’s side. Asked what he wants at Chelsea, Silva told Chelsea’s official website on Monday, “My aim is to win.” He added: “As I said before, it is a young team and we are aiming to win as many games as possible. “We know that the opposition will never make life easy for us and will have prepared to win the game, but I will work as hard as I can from the very start. “I always say that if you have a match tomorrow, then you cannot start preparing for it today. Preparation does not work like that; it happens over a period of time.” Silva will hope to make his Chelsea debut when they take on West Brom in the Premier League next weekend.

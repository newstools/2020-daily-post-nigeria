The Peoples Democratic Party in Anambra State has issued a directive, barring aspirants of the party in the 2021 governorship election from maligning each other. The chairman of the party in the state, Mr Ndubuisi Nwobu handed down the directive on Wednesday, during a meeting of the members of the state working committee. Nwobu said, “We shall ensure that the processes leading to the primary election are fair, transparent and free. We are doing this because we know that if the primary election is transparent, aspirants who did not win will support the winner. “We are urging all aspirants not to malign each other. Look at other governorship aspirants as your brothers and sisters and look for a way to liaise with them. If the process is transparent, we know that we can get the losers to join hands in marketing the winner of the party’s ticket for the election.

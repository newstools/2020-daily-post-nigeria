Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemate, Tolanibaj has finally revealed her intention for Neo outside the house. Recall BBNaija official host, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu had asked Tolanibaj on Sunday about her future with Neo, but she had declined to respond on the matter. However, during her media rounds on Wednesday, the evicted housemate said she had no plans to pursue any relationship with Neo. She further clarified that she has no feelings for Neo and was misunderstood. Tolanibaj said: “I will finally address the Neo situation, there is no relationship for Neo and me in the future. “I was misunderstood, I do not have feelings for Neo but I find him attractive. There is a difference between when you find someone attractive or want to have a relationship with the person.” Recall that housemates were in shock on Sunday after Erica revealed Tolanibaj had intentions for Neo. Erica told Ebuka that she advised Tolanibaj to pursue her feelings for Neo despite his relationship with Vee because Vee is not her friend.

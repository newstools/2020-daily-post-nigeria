Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, Nengi, has again told Ozo that she is not keen on having a romantic affair with him. During Saturday’s party, Ozo professed his love to Nengi again, saying “I love you, Nengi”. Nengi’s reply was “I don’t need your stupid love. Love yourself first”. As Ozo tried to hold onto her, Nengi pleaded with him to leave her alone. Ozo is up for eviction this week, along with Dorathy, Laycon and Trikytee. The winner of the show will be announced next week. I don’t need your Stupid love – Nengi to Ozo. #Bbnaija pic.twitter.com/Bl4pmCxKcF — Sweet Potato ✨ (@Drewbaba) September 19, 2020

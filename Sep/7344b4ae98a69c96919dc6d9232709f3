The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has said the death of the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Shehu Idris, is the end of an era. Tinubu stated this in a condolence message released from his media office. He described the late monarch as a “father and a friend” to him. “I’m saddened by the news of the passing on Sunday of the Emir of Zazzau, Alhaji Shehu Idris. “His passing marks the end of an era in Zazzau Emirate and indeed in the North. As the longest reigning traditional monarch in the emirate and perhaps the North, Alhaji Idris ruled with dedication and distinction,” part of the statement read. Tinubu also hailed Alhaji Idris as a detribalised Nigerian, who was “close to many Northern leaders as he was close to Southern leaders. The former Lagos State governor further prayed for the repose of the soul of the late Emir, who passed on at the age of 84. He died at the 44 Military Hospital in Kaduna after a brief illness.

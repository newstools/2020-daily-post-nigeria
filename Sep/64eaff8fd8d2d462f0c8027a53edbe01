Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Venita, has reacted to the disqualification of Erica, another reality star in the 2020 edition of the show. In an Instagram live show, Venita said she disagrees with some strikes being issued to housemates by Big Brother. According to Venita, Erica would be missed by both viewers and fellow housemates because she has content. Recalling that some housemates also got strikes and disqualification during her season, the former double wahala housemate said “The girl [Erica] has content. You won’t take that away from her at all. “And I feel like, …I don’t know, but there is so much that happened …even in my season some people got strikes numbering into two or three. “I don’t know…but some things are…some strikes I disagree with and others I understand but I mean, she’s definitely going to be missed.”

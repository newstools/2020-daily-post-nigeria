Former Liverpool defender, Jamie Carragher, has said he does not see where Kai Havertz fits into Chelsea’s set-up. The German international has made an underwhelming start to life with the Blues. Havertz made his debut in the 3-1 win at Brighton on Monday, but failed to impress from the right wing. He is still awaiting his first goal or assist for Chelsea, after he was taken off at half time during the 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday. Carragher, speaking on Sky Sports, expressed his concerns about Havertz who cost Frank Lampard’s side £72million. “I do look and think, ‘where does Havertz play? Where does he fit into a 4-3-3?’ “He almost looks like a No10 and we don’t see them as much in football now. Where he played today, I don’t think that suited Chelsea,” Carragher said about the 21-year-old.

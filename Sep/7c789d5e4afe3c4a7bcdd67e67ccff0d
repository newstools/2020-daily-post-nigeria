The Oyo State chapter of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) says Governor Seyi Makinde disappointed himself for failing to fulfil the promises made to the party few days to the 2019 gubernatorial election. DAILY POST recalls that ZLP is one of the political parties that worked for the success of Makinde who contested on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Our correspondent learned that the ZLP candidate, Barrister Sharafadeen Alli, African Democratic Congress (ADC) gubernatorial candidate, Barrister Olufemi Lanlehin and Social Democratic Party (SDP) Chief Bolaji Ayorinde (SAN) and some politicians were persuaded by a former Governor of the state, Senator Rasidi Ladoja to shelve their ambitions and support Makinde who defeated All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Mr. Adebayo Adelabu in the March 9th 2019 election. Few days before the election, a meeting was held at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Secretariat in Ibadan where promises were made by Makinde to candidates of other political parties that worked for him. It was, however, learned that seventeen months after the promises were made, Makinde was yet to fulfil the promises to the political parties among whom is ZLP. ZLP Chairman, Comrade Wole Abisoye while reacting, insisted that Makinde did not disappoint the party, but only disappointed himself by not honouring the agreements. Abisoye who addressed party members at the Oyo South Senatorial meeting of the party held in Ibadan on Tuesday, however, vowed that the party is ready to unseat Makinde in 2023. The ZLP Chairman while speaking at the meeting attended by ZLP gubernatorial candidate in 2019, Barrister Sharafadeen Alli, ZLP Senatorial candidate for Oyo South in 2019, Mr. Remi Olajide, ZLP candidate for Ido/ Ibarapa East Federal constituency, Mr. Bimbo Adepoju and state women leader, Mrs. Bola Alonge maintained that the party has a solid structure to defeat Makinde in 2023. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-835881 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200901_130546-1024x768.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="555" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200901_130546-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200901_130546-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200901_130546-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200901_130546-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"> He said, “Makinde disappointed himself for not honouring our agreements.

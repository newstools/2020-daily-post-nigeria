Some candidates who successfully completed the police online recruitment registration and proceeded for physical screening have been left stranded after Benue State Police Command suspended and threatened to cancel the process. DAILY POST gathered that the affected candidates from Ogbadibo Local Government Area were stopped from participating in the screening. It was learnt that the police authority who did not give any reason for the act vowed not to screen candidates from the local govt. The officers tear-gassed and chased out applicants from the venue. Most of them who came from other states such as Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Port Harcourt and a host of other states are now stranded in the state. See Video below:

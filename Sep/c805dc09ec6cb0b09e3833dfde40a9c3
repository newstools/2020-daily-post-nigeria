President Muhammadu Buhari has said that his government has begun the distribution of palliatives worth N10.9 billion to households in the country. The President spoke yesterday via video-message, on the first day of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly. The disbursement, according to the Nigerian leader, is part of the efforts of the government to reduce the suffering of Nigerians imposed by the Coronavirus pandemic. “In order to mitigate its impact on Nigerians, our administration has commenced the disbursement of the sum of N10.9 Billion to households and Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises as palliatives,” he said. Buhari restated that the country under his watch is committed to working with other member states to better the lives of its people. “Nigeria will continue to partner with the WHO and some countries to ensure accelerated development and manufacturing, as well as the uninhibited supply of safe and effective Coronavirus vaccines to all,” he said. He said that his administration has set up a N500 billion fiscal stimulus package and sustained delivery of humanitarian and social interventions to poor and vulnerable households. Recall that the government had earlier in the week opened the portal for its Survival Fund, a supportive initiative for Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, MSMEs in the country. The government, through this initiative, is set to spend N2.3 trillion to manage the economic fallout of COVID-19 and help prevent the country from going into a deep recession. The Survival Fund is part of the government’s economic sustainability plan.

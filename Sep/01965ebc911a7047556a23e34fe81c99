The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has reacted to the recent increment in electricity tariffs and fuel price in Nigeria by the Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. The federal government had a few days ago hiked the fuel pump price of petrol to N151.6 per litre, a piece of news that was greeted with widespread reflection. Ayodele, however, said the development marked a confirmation of one of his prophecies in 2015 during the release of his annual book of prophecy titled ‘Warning to the nations’. He frowned at the government for making policies that will not make life better for Nigerians, noting that the government is in a confused state, hence, difficult for it to know what to do. He further prophesied that Nigeria could break up and warned citizens to brace up for more crises. While berating the performance of the government in security and employment, he lamented that the dollar may soon likely exchange for N500. “Nigeria has just started to suffer, this government has nothing to offer, they don’t know what to do, they don’t have direction, we are not talking about that alone, we are talking about security, the government of Buhari is not interested in making lives better for the citizens, how long do we continue to manage this? “The Lord spoke to me that Nigeria will break, international debt is nothing to write home about, the rate of unemployment is high, Nigeria will still go into recession no matter what, the people in charge of the economy are confused, this is the fulfilment of my prophecy. “I said in 2015 that Nigeria will still buy petrol at 150 if care isn’t taken, the dollar will jack up to 500 naira, some governors will not be able to pay the N30,000 minimum wage. “Nigeria needs prayers, the crisis has not started, as from next year, there will be a water shortage, famine, food scarcity.’’

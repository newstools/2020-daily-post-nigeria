Bauchi State government on Monday distributed 3,500 units of food items to victims of flood in the Warji Local Government Area of the state. The state governor, Senator Bala Mohammed, who performed the distribution exercise at the council secretariat, said the gesture was to cushion the hardship caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the devastating flood in the area. While handing over the food items to the district head of Warji, who is the chairman of the palliatives committee in the area, Governor Mohammed informed that Warji LGA is the 11th local government area in the state to have benefitted from the distribution. The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Senator Baba Tela, said the items are meant for 3,500 households, adding that the items are only meant to ameliorate their sufferings. According to him, “So far, the Bauchi State government has distributed palliatives to 10 local governments. In Warji, we are bringing 3,500 units of relief materials to 3,500 households.” “As we get more palliatives from donors such as Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID) who has been in the forefront of sending relief materials to us and the Federal Government through the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, we will continue to gauge and continue to distribute palliative materials to the people of Bauchi state as at when due,” he assured.

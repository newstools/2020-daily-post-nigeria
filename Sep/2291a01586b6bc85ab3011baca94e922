Manchester United’s first summer signing, Donny van de Beek, will wear the no.34 shirt after goalkeeper Dean Henderson accepted his request to give up the number. The Dutchman’s £40.3million move to Old Trafford was confirmed on Wednesday. Van de Beek wore the no.6 shirt at Ajax, but was keen to take the no.34 shirt in tribute to his former teammate and close friend, Abdelhak ‘Appie’ Nouri, who was in a coma for nearly three years after collapsing during a game against Werder Bremen in 2017. Nouri wore the no.34 shirt for Ajax. United confirmed on their official website, that Henderson had ‘kindly’ accepted Van de Beek’s request to take the shirt and the goalkeeper will be allocated a new number. “This is a special thing for me because my good friend Abdelhak Nouri.. maybe you know the story. “So I decided to take his old number on my shirt. I want to get good memories with this number,” the 23-year-old said.

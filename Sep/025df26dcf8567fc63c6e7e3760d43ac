The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) has said it will release the results of the just concluded West African Senior Secondary School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) within 45. The examination ended on Saturday nationwide and in other four West African member countries of WAEC – Ghana, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Gambia. A total of 1,459,463 students sat for the exams in Nigeria. The head of public affairs of WAEC Nigeria, Demianus Ojijeogu, on Sunday told newsmen that the results will be available soon. “Certainly, we will still work towards achieving this 45 days time lag target,” Ojijeogu said. He described the conduct of the exams as a huge success, saying it was hitch-free nationwide.

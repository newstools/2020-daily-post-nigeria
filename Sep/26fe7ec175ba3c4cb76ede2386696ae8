The United States America (USA) has said it will reconsider its ban on some categories of migrant visas on Nigeria. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Amb. Mustapha Sulaiman, stated this while speaking to newsman at the end of the inaugural meeting of the U.S/Nigeria Forum on Wednesday in Abuja. According to Sulaiman, Nigeria has accomplished almost 90 per cent of the requirements by the US government, which had resulted in the ban. He said the Nigerian government’s efforts have led to the US re-evaluating the country. “From the assessment of the recipient of our response, I think we have accomplished almost 90 per cent of the requirements that has been established in that regard. “And I am sure that if you follow the information that has been passed on the level of compliance, for instance sharing of information, we have done so much in that regard. “That is why I believe the U.S government is having the comfort to even re-evaluate otherwise, we wouldn’t have been candidates for re-evaluation,” he said.

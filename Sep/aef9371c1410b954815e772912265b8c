Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Prince, has said that disqualified housemate, Erica needs to see a therapist. Prince said this after Sunday night live eviction show, which also had Lucy evicted. Speaking with Dorathy, Prince said he spoke to Erica in the afternoon and realised she has bottled anger towards her mother and that’s a major reason for her actions. He advised that Erica talks with her mother and visit a therapist to solve her issues. Prince said: “Erica has bottled anger towards her mother. I told her to meet her mother after she leaves the house to help her get over whatever vacuum she feels in her life. “I told her not to try to seek out companionship from people because people will disappoint you. You need to be contented in yourself.”

Big Brother Naija lockdown housemate, Nengi, has confronted Ozo, her ‘best friend’ in the house over his recent attitude towards her. Since after the Sunday night eviction show, Ozo, who was one of the housemates put up for possible eviction, has obviously been acting strangely towards Nengi. The Bayelsa-born housemate had even cried to Biggie about the matter during her diary session. Nengi, during a private conversation with Ozo on Monday night, also made it clear that she wouldn’t come to his (Ozo) bed for any reason, insisting that, “I don’t like coming to your bed.” “It’s not like you were the only person feeling the eviction thing. Really you are like my best friend in the house and I want you to be here. “I was feeling it too. Just like you always do every night, why was yesterday night an exception that you couldn’t keep your pillow here, as I always told you, keep your pillow here it’s very easy, so that we can talk? “But you said I should walk all the way to your bed…you can just keep your pillow here and we just talk. It’s easy. I don’t have to come to your bed. You know I don’t like coming to your bed. “I feel like you’ve been given an attitude from Saturday. I don’t know. I feel you’ve been giving me a weird vibe since then. Do you know what I think? “I feel like it started after our conversation on Saturday, then Ebuka’s question now worsened it. Tell me I’m lying. I’m not lying of course, I know. “I don’t want the picture either. You can have it. Yesterday I was telling you that we should have a conversation but you ignored me. You ignored me.”

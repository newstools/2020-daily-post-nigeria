Luis Suarez had a Manchester United clause written into his Barcelona contract, according to the UK Mirror. The clause bars Suarez from signing for the Red Devils on a free. The Uruguay striker is now on the verge of joining Atletico Madrid. New Barca manager, Ronald Koeman, told Suarez that he is now surplus to requirements at the Camp Nou. Juventus were initial favourites to sign the 33-year-old, subject to him passing an Italian language test. It is understood that despite Atletico being a direct rival to Barcelona, Diego Simeoneâ€™s team is not included on the list of teams Suarez is barred from joining. Clubs on the list reportedly include Manchester United, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid.

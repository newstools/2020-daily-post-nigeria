The Comptroller-General of Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Muhammad Babandede, has directed all intending passengers to China, to obtain COVID-19 negative test certificate before departing for the Asian country. They are required to take a Nucleic Acid test three days before departure with effect from September 1, 2020. This was contained in a statement signed by the NIS spokesman, DCI Sunday James, on Friday. It noted that Chinese citizens must apply for ‘Green Health Codes’ with ‘HS’ mark, while other foreign nationals including Nigerians, are to complete the health declaration forms. Foreigners travelling to China and Chinese citizens must submit COVID-19 negative test certificates to the Chinese Embassy or Consulate in Nigeria, so they can be issued the required clearance for their journey to China. It added, “Non-resident Nigerians in Europe and North America are to avoid transiting France pending the lifting of travel restrictions due to COVID-19. Transit passengers to Europe and North America transiting through Paris must endeavour to present a valid permanent resident permit for their final destination and COVID-19 negative test certificate to enable them to gain entry into France.” The statement further disclosed that from September 1, only French nationals and residents will be allowed into France with respect to the note verbale from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The immigration service advised all China, Europe and North American-bound passengers, to abide by the rules to avoid denial of departure from Nigeria and repatriation from the countries concerned due to non-compliance.

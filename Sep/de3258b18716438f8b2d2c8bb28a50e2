Former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi, has declared that Edo State and South-South region are strongholds of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). He spoke on Tuesday in Oza, Orhionmwon Local Government Area while campaigning for Governor Godwin Obaseki. Obi and PDP leaders addressed supporters during his ward-to-ward campaign in Oza Ward 2. The former vice-presidential candidate urged Indigenes to vote massively for the party. “Your governor is working, the whole of South-South is PDP, Edo cannot be different. You have a working governor, go anywhere outside Edo, people are proud of him. “He is doing the right thing, he is doing well in education, he is doing well in health, he is doing well in poverty alleviation, he is the man we want,” Obi said. The Edo governorship election will be held on September 19.

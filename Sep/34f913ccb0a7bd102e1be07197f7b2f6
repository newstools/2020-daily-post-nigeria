Former Manchester United captain, Gary Neville, has said the club can only win the Premier League this season, if they go out and sign four top players before the summer transfer window closes. The Red Devils finished in third place last season, 33 points behind champions Liverpool. January signing, Bruno Fernandes, became a key player as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men clinched a Champions League ticket. The squad has been bolstered already this summer with Dutch midfielder, Donny van de Beek. But Neville believes United are still a way off competing for the title. He also admitted that they might have to until Jurgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola leave England, before they realize that dream. “It’s out of the question for me, if you ask me today, with the squads that they’ve got,” Neville told MirrorSport. “If United were to sign two outstanding forwards, an amazing centre-back and a fantastic left-back in the next three weeks, then maybe. “The one thing I can guarantee you is that United will win again. “That might not be this year or next year, but it will be amazing when they win again, and the longer it builds up, the greater the actual feeling is when you do it. “It will be, maybe, when Klopp and Guardiola leave Liverpool and City – hopefully in the next couple of years!” United begin their 2020/2021 campaign against Crystal Palace this weekend.

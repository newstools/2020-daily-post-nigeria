American Professional tennis player, Serena Williams has pulled out from the 2020 event because of an Achilles injury. The 39-year-old three-time French Open champion came into the tournament nursing an Achilles injury she picked up during her semi-final defeat at the US Open earlier this month. She was also scheduled to play her second-round match against Bulgaria’s Tsvetana Pironkova on Wednesday and was aiming to equal Margaret Court’s all-time record of 24 before she pulled out from the event. However, Williams in a statement released said she and her coach already discussed her pulling out of the game because of her injury. According to her, she needed more time to get healed properly. “After I warmed up, though it was a very short warm-up I talked to my coach and I was like, ‘What do you think? “We both thought about it and we really realised that it likely wasn’t the best for me to play today. “I love playing in Paris, I really wanted to give an effort here. “My Achilles didn’t have time to properly heal. “I’m struggling to walk so that’s kind of a tell-tale sign that I should try to recover,” she said.

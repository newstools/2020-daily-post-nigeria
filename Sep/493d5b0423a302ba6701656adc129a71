The United States Government has praised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security personnel, for the roles they played in the just concluded Edo governorship election. In a statement issued by the US Mission in Abuja on Wednesday, it, however, expressed concern over reports of vote-buying, some violence and intimidation of voters and civil society domestic observers during the election. It also recognized the critical role that Governor Godwin Obaseki and Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu played in promoting peace. “We thank the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the Nigerian security services on the positive role they played in the election and commend their work in strengthening Nigeria’s democracy. “The United States remains concerned with reports of some violence that did emerge during the election and by reports of vote-buying and intimidation of both voters and civil society domestic observers. “We will continue to encourage all stakeholders including INEC, political parties, and the security services, to improve the electoral process in the upcoming Ondo State governorship election,” it read. Obaseki defeated Ize-Iyamu at the polls with a margin of 84,336 votes.

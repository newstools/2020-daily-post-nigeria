The governorship candidate of the Edo State All Progressives Congress (APC), Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has called off his rally at Usen, following a road crash. This was after a trailer ran into the travelling campaign entourage of top chieftains of the APC and claimed many lives before the popular Oluku junction in the State. In a statement signed by the Chairman of the APC Media Campaign Council, Mr. John Mayaki, the campaign said it was suspending the scheduled event, to honour the dead. The statement, which was made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday, also condoled with the families of the victims. It pledged that the campaign would do everything within its powers to ameliorate their grief. Reaching out to the families of the policemen involved in the fatal crash, the campaign said Edo would never forget their supreme sacrifice. It called on everyone to pray for the soul of the dead and against the recurrence of such tragedies.

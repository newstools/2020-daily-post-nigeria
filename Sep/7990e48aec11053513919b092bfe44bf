The Executive Chairman, Yobe State Independent Electoral Commission, (YOSIEC), Dr. Mamman Mohammed has explained that the desire by the Commission to save lives is the motive behind shifting the local government councils election to next year. He said the resurgence of two new confirmed cases recorded recently in the state has compelled the Commission to shift the election by two months. According to Mohammed, the Yobe State government is on top of the situation and the state Ministry of Health has taken positive steps to identify and isolate persons who have been in contact with confirmed cases. “We are confident that the resurgence of the virus will be contained as it was contained earlier by the committed administration of His Excellency, Ho. Mai Mala Buni, the Executive Governor of Yobe State”. The Executive Chairman, YOSIEC Dr. Mamman Mohammed said “To be proactive to save one life is worth it because you don’t know whose life is going. So any step you take to prevent death; medically is alright, socially is alright and even politically is alright. “We were prepared for the elections of local government chairmen and councillors, the extension in the date of the election by two months does mean we are not going to conduct the election, but it makes us very meticulous in all our steps. Dr. Mohammed also announced that the Commission has received policy documents from both the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, (NCDC) containing instructive information on conducting an election under COVID-19 pandemic. He, however, appealed to stakeholders to appreciate the important development and support the state in conducting successful, free, fair and transparent local government election under COVID-19 outbreak, guideline and prevention protocols.

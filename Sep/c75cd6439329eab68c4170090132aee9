Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has described as unfortunate the fire disaster that consumed over 5000 units of card readers at the headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC in the state. Akeredolu who visited the scene of the incident on Friday expressed shock over the development, particularly that the governorship election in the state is less than 30 days. While urging the commission to unravel the cause of the inferno, the governor who is seeking a reelection at the forthcoming poll stated that the incident will no doubt be a huge additional cost to the commission’s preparedness for the October 10 poll. “We sympathize with you and we want INEC to know that the people of this state are really concerned and are with you at this point in time in this calamitous situation. “I can see the determination from how you spoke that the election will still hold on the 10th of October, we are so sorry about this.” On Thursday night, fire gutted the ICT section of the commission where 5141 units of card readers meant for the October 10 governorship election were burnt and destroyed.

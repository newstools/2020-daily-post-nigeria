New Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has told Lionel Messi, that he is expected to replicate his brilliant performances from previous years when the new season begins. Messi is getting ready to play his first match for the club since he failed in his attempt to force a move away. Barca plays Gimnastic Tarragona in a friendly on Saturday and the 33-year-old could feature after Koeman hinted that he will field two separate line-ups in each half. Messi only returned to pre-season training on Monday and has worked on the squad’s days off, as he tries to improve his fitness. “I have already said it several times that Messi is the best. “Messi, when he is physically fit, is a very important player as he has shown for many years and I hope he can repeat it this year,” Koeman told a press conference on Friday.

Novak Djokovic has been disqualified from the US Open. It ended the top seedâ€™s bid for an 18th Grand Slam title. Djokovic had just lost a game to his opponent, Pablo Carreno Busta, falling behind 6-5 in the first set. As he walked to the sideline for the changeover, he hit a ball behind him. The ball hit a female line judge, who dropped to her knees and held her neck. After a long discussion with officials and tournament referee Soeren Friemel, Djokovic shook hands with Carreno Busta. The chair umpire, Aurelie Tourte, then confirmed the default. Djokovic had not lost this season, enjoying a 26-match winning run, and had secured his 17th Grand Slam singles title at the Australia Open.

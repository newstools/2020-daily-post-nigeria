The ongoing probe of Ibrahim Magu, the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, witnessed some drama yesterday as Justice Ayo Salami sent his (Magu) lawyers out of the venue, according to Channels Television. Justice Salami is the Chairman of the presidential panel, probing the activities of the EFCC from 2015 to 2020, a period of time Magu was in charge. Salami reportedly ordered security operatives to walk out two lawyers on the former EFCC boss’s legal team shortly after they were introduced by lead lawyer, Wahab Shittu. Channels Television reports that trouble started when Shittu introduced the two lawyers as members of Magu’s legal team but Justice Salami interrupted him, insisting that only him (Shittu) would be allowed to defend the suspended EFCC acting chairman. The suspended EFCC Chairman had last week asked the panel to recall the witnesses who earlier testified against him in his absence at the ongoing corruption probe. Magu’s letter was dated September 4 and addressed to the Chairman of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry, through his counsel, Wahab Shittu. He argued that the request to recall several witnesses was in the interest of fair hearing.

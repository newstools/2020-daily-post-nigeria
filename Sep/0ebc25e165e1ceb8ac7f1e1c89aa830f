Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has rubbished speculations claiming Mason Mount is unhappy with the £72million signing of Kai Havertz. Havertz moved to Stamford Bridge last week on a five-year deal. The 21-year-old enjoyed another fine with Bayer Leverkusen last season with 18 goals and nine assists. His arrival at Chelsea is likely to limit Mount’s game time, as the duo occupy similar areas of the pitch. “I saw the story about Mason Mount and I know it was absolutely fabricated from someone, particularly if it came from the German end,” Lampard told a press conference on Thursday. “I will be fair on how I pick the team. I won’t pick the team on whether you came from the academy. I will pick the team on how I think it should be picked every week, how they train and how they have been performing.” The Blues begin the 2020/2021 campaign away at Brighton.

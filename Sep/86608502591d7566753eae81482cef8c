The All Progressives Congress (APC) has told a Federal High Court in Abuja, that Adams Oshiomhole-led National Working Committee (NWC) was sacked to ensure an end to the party’s internal crises. APC said the Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee constituted was to put the platform back on track. This was contained in its response to a lawsuit challenging the NWC dissolution instituted by a chieftain, Kalu Agu. APC said Agu’s court case was part of a plot to destabilize it. In a five-paragraph counter-affidavit, the ruling party insisted that by its own constitution, the National Executive Committee (NEC) has power to set up any committee including the current led Yobe Governor, Mai Mala Buni. The affidavit was deposed to by Adenike Adelakun, a Librarian in APC legal department. APC further said that Buni and other caretaker committee members are eminently qualified for their appointment. They party prayed the court to dismiss the suit. Meanwhile, Agu has asked the court to order continued hearing of the substantive suit during the ongoing vacation of the Federal High Court. He also pleaded another order abridging the time within which the 14 respondents are to file and serve jointly or severally their counter-affidavit and other processes in response to the suit. Agu’s motion on notice filed by Ukpai Ukairo was predicated on the grounds that his suit is a pre-election matter which ought to be decided within 180 days prescribed by the constitution. Lateef Fagbemi, counsel to the APC caretaker committee members, argued that the suit has no particular life span. He said subject matter of the suit did not relate to any particular election and urged the court to decline the request. Justice Taiwo Taiiwo, after taking submission from parties in the matter, fixed September 18 to deliver ruling on whether to hear the matter during the court’s vacation or not.

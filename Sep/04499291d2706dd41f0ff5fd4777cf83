The residents of Old-Ewu and Ogunyinka Mafoluku communities in Oshodi-Isolo Local Government Area (LGA) of Lagos State have cried to the state government to save them from the flood in the community. Both vehicular and pedestrian movements have become difficult in the community when it rains, as residents have to battle to cross the heavy flood. The most affected streets include Ilare Close, Muse Oyinbo Close and Tijani kashimawo Close off 7/8 bus-stop, facing the First bank along Airport Road. Other affected places are Dominican school, Saint Jude Catholic Church and Domino shop in Mafoluku Oshodi. The cause of the flood was traced to the bad drainage system in the community and lack of gutters in some streets, hindering the free flow of water. Affected residents have taken to wearing rain boots when going in and out of their houses to protect themselves. Speaking for the residents, the Community Development Association (CDA) chairperson, Mrs. Durotola Akinyemi said they need the help of the government to fix the gutters in the community. She lamented: “Flood has taken over our community. We move around in rain boots despite the fact that we cleared the drainage last year yet, we are still experiencing flood. We need the intervention of the government to fix our drainages to save us from the flood. “Just one rainfall, everywhere in the community has turned to a pool and we cannot move in and out of our houses, what will be our fate when the rain continues intensely as predicted by the Nigerian Meteorological Services (NIMET).”

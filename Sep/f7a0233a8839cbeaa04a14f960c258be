Chelsea are set to ramp up their interest in Rennes goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy, this week. According to the UK Mirror, Mendy comes highly recommended by the Blues’ technical director, Petr Cech. Cech himself played for Rennes before his move to Stamford Bridge in 2004. Chelsea are desperately trying to find a new keeper, having already shown interest in Ajax’s Andre Onana, Burnley’s Nick Pope and Borussia Dortmund’s Roman Burki. But they will turn their attentions to Mendy, as they look for a new No 1 ahead of the Premier League season. Kepa Arrizabalaga has fallen out of favour with manager Frank Lampard, with the Spaniard left on the bench for their final fixtures last campaign. Mendy will reportedly cost Chelsea around £18million, as owner Roman Abrahmovic continues to splash the cash in the club’s summer rebuild under Frank Lampard.

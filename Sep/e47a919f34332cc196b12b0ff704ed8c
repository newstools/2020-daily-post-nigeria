Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State has raised an alarm of children being recruited into the Boko Haram terrorist group. Speaking while receiving a committee of members of the House Of Representatives at his office in Maiduguri, Zulum said the recruitment of kids into the terrorist group was due to the high rate of unemployment in the state. He also revealed that there are more than 700,000 Internally Displaced Persons in Monguno and another 400,000 in Gamboru Ngala without access to their farmlands. “The only solution we have now is to ensure the safe return of our people to their homes in a dignified manner. “If nothing is done believe me sincerely we shall face a very serious challenge even more than what we are facing now. “This is because right now the insurgents are recruiting many of our children into the sect because of the increasing unemployment rate,” he said. He, however, said that the solution to this problem is to shift from short term Humanitarian support to longer-term development and sustainable solution with the safe return of internally displaced persons to their communities.

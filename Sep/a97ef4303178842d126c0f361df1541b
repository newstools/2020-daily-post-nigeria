Speaking when the leaders visited Gov. Ugwuanyi at the Government House, Enugu, the President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Nnia Nwodo, applauded the governor for the recent rating of Enugu as one of the six economically viable states in Nigeria that can survive without federal allocations. Chief Nwodo, who was accompanied by the Obi of Onitsha, His Royal Majesty, Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Achebe and Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, added that Enugu was the only state in the South East geopolitical zone to accomplish such an outstanding feat. He disclosed that they were at the Government House, Enugu on a routine consultation “we are having with our governors on matters of Igbo concern”. The Ohanaeze President-General revealed that they appraised the developmental issues in Igbo land and took brief on Gov. Ugwuanyi’s budget priorities in the areas of digital education, health, infrastructure, security, among others “and we are pleased with what he told us”. The Igbo leaders expressed delight that the governor has maintained a peaceful atmosphere in Enugu State, and has equally reduced political differences to the barest minimum that there is no more issue of bickering or quarrel. According to Nwodo, “we have listened to the governor about things he has done to make Enugu remain peaceful and to ensure that the people of the state live in peace, and we commend him for what he has done to earn Enugu the enviable status as one of the most peaceful states in Igbo land and Nigeria. “This is not the only governor we have visited. This is the third governor we have visited in the ten days. We have paid a visit to the Governor of Imo State; we met with Governor of Ebonyi State this morning and we are going to meet with the Governors of Abia as well as Anambra States in the coming days.

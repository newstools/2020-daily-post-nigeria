The National Union of Local Government Employees (NULGE) in Oyo State, on Tuesday, conducted an election to elect new leaders of the association. DAILY POST gathered that the election, which took place in the early hours of Tuesday in Ibadan, was conducted despite a court order, which restrained the association against conduct of the election in the state. Our correspondent learnt that the election of the new executive, which was held overnight, was in total disregard to a court injunction that the conduct of the election should be put on hold. Investigations by DAILY POST revealed that the restraining order against the conduct of the congress and election of the association was issued by Justice N. C. S. Ogbuanya at a sitting of the National Industrial Court in Lagos. It was issued based on a case filed by Comrade Hakeem Ojo Oyewo over his “unlawful and unexplained exclusion” as a candidate for the office of the state president in the election. The restraining order remains valid pending the hearing and determination of the case. It was gathered that some members of the association in the early hours of Tuesday elected Comrade Ayobami Olusegun Adeogun as the President of the union in the state. Adeogun, who spoke after his emergence promised not to disappoint the union.

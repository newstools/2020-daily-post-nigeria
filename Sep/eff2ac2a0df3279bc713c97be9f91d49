Manchester United have completed the signing of Atletico Madrid striker, Alejandro Garnacho. According to the Manchester Evening News, Man United and Atletico Madrid have agreed to a deal that will allow Garnacho arrive in Manchester from Spain later this week. Garnacho, 16, will then be quarantined for 14 days as part of the COVID-19 protocols before he will join the Red Devils academy. This will make Garnacho the clubâ€™s third signing from Spain following the arrival of Marc Jurado from Barcelona and Alvaro Fernandez from Real Madrid. Jurado, 16, and Fernandez, 17, arrived in Manchester from Spain last month and have been quarantining. However, Man United are yet to confirm the signing of the duo formally.

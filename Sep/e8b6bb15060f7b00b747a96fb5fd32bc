The Nigeria Army has moved to reassure residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja, that they are on red alert to combat crime. This follows a ‘purported memorandum’ from the Nigeria Customs, warning its staff about a possible attack in the nation’s capital. The Customs’ internal memo was signed by the Comptroller of Enforcement at the NCS headquarters, H. A. Sabo. Sabo claimed Boko Haram has selected targets within the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). However, a statement from the Nigeria Army signed by Coordinator Defence Media Operations, John Enenche, on Sunday, said: “the Armed Forces of Nigeria working together with other security and response agencies particularly the core intelligence agencies hereby assure the general public that preventive and preemptive intelligence are ongoing. “The general public is thus advised to go about their lawful businesses undeterred.” It also promised that “offensives against the common enemies of this Nation will not cease until normalcy is restored in all parts of the country. Hence, the general public is equally enjoined to remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity accordingly.”

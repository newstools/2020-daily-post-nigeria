He also gave the names of some party members shot. “We were attacked in Ipele and Owo township in Owo Local Government Area by heavily armed APC political thugs. Hon. Amuda Sikiru, Messrs Taye Akintufede and Seun Ogunlade were all shot and wounded. Our vehicles were burnt and destroyed. “These thugs are threatening the peace and stability of our state, and I call on the Inspector General of Police to protect the lives and properties of the people of Ondo State. We, however, will not be intimidated in the pursuit of victory in the oncoming election”, he tweeted. The governorship election will be held on October 10.

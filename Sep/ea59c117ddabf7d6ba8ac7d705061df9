Chisom Dike, the member of the House of Representatives for Tai-Oyigbo-Eleme Federal Constituency, has decamped from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State. Dike also rejected the Sports Utility Vehicles (SUVs) Governor Nyesom Wike recently gave to all National Assembly members from the state. The lawmaker said he could not accept the Governor’s gift because of the deplorable condition of all the roads in his primary constituency, Oyigbo. Dike said the roads in Oyigbo were death trap and impassible, adding that people of the area were suffering untold hardship because of inability to access Port Harcourt, the state capital. He said: “The state of roads in my constituency made me to reject the car gift from the governor. “I represent Eleme, Oyigbo and Tai. We have made a lot of representation to the government but none had been taken. “Currently, Oyigbo is impassable. You need to travel through two local government areas before you get to Oyigbo. “My former party is in power in Rivers State alongside other indigenes from our area but we could not effect any change,” Dike was quoted by the Nation He said even though the PDP Chairman in the state and other party leaders hail from his local government, everything stops on Governor Wike’s table and the governor has his priorities

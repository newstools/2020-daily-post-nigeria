A foremost banker, Hakeem Bello-Osagie has called on regulators of the nation’s financial technology sector to reduce the entry requirements into the financial technology industry in Nigeria to grant young entrepreneurs the opportunity to play in the sector. Bello-Osagie, who was a guest at an online mentorship program organised by former Aviation Minister, Osita Chidoka on Friday regretted the failure of Nigeria’s leadership in providing a platform for young entrepreneurs to thrive. He noted that Nigeria was filled with people from different backgrounds with loads of talents, who are willing to make contributions in the area of financial technology. The former Chairman of UBA said he acquired the most shares while a banker, noting that the idea of young people coming together to own a bank and accomplish something remarkable showed that a team from different parts of Nigeria could come together, overcome their differences and achieve so much. “Though due to systematic changes in the financial market, it may be difficult for young people in the 21st century to acquire a bank and take it to a higher level, there are other areas young people can key in to bring the necessary changes, especially through technology. “I call on youths to utilize the opportunity in the tech space as a means of entry into the banking, insurance and other parts of the financial sector, as a way to beat the high barriers set up by regulators.” The businessman said that every young person has potential, and should be encouraged once they prove they are trustworthy and have the requisite knowledge. He encouraged the youths to have a clear picture of a Nigeria bound by a common humanity and ambition, and to embrace their differences and work together to achieve the common goal. The mentorship series which is organised by Chidoka in memory of his mentor, Chief Ojo Mmadụekwe, aims to create an online platform where personalities who have carved a niche in their industry share their experiences and help young people figure out their paths in life.

The governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, of planing to declare the Saturday governorship election inconclusive. He said the APC, having discovered that it lost the election, had mounted pressure on the Commission to declare the poll inconclusive over the result from Orhionmwon LGA. The PDP, Edo election campaign chairman, during a press briefing at the Government House in Benin City, called on the international community and President Muhammad Buhari to prevail on INEC. “INEC has earned commendation so far but should not allow the commendation halfway. “I’m aware that this same returning officer for Orhionmwon is right now inside the office of the administrative secretary of INEC in Benin here. They should not subvert the will of the people,” Wike added.

Lionel Messi, on Friday, finally confirmed he will be spending the 2020/2021 season with Barcelona. The 33-year-old unsuccessfully tried to force a move away from Camp Nou this summer, where he has called home for almost 20 years. Messi, speaking to Goal, pointed fingers at president Josep Bartomeu, who he claimed he told he wanted to leave for over a year. “I believed that the club needed more young players, new players and I thought my time in Barcelona was over,” the Argentine said. He further admitted that “it was a very difficult year, I suffered a lot in training, in games and in the dressing room. “Everything became very difficult for me and there came a time when I considered looking for new ambitions.” Everything pointed to Messi heading to Manchester City in the Premier League. The former English champions were ready to pay up to £100m and part with three players to seal a deal. It would have seen Messi finally play in another league apart from LaLiga. However, it appears we will never see the diminutive magician in England. And we will eternally be left wondering if he can do it on a cold, windy night in the North West. Next year, if he eventually leaves Barca, he will be 34 and not even Pep Guardiola will be as keen. Guardiola would have been delighted to be reunited with Messi, without whom he has never won the Champions League. But he now has to scour the transfer market for other reinforcements in his bid to land the holy grail.

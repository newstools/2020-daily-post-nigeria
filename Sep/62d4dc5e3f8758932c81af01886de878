Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has condemned Tuesday’s broadcast by the All Progressives Congress (APC) national leader, Bola Tinubu. Tinubu said he fought for democracy and that Obaseki should not be reelected. The governor and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) will slug it out with APC’s Osagie Ize-Iyamu on Saturday. Obaseki, through his spokesman, Crusoe Osagie, told Tinubu that he cannot extend his political empire to Edo. He vowed that the people will end godfatherism in the state. “It has become obvious that the spirited fight which Edo people have put up against godfatherism has sent tremors beyond the shores of Edo to the likes of Tinubu, who has for years sustained a stranglehold on Lagos and other states in South-Western Nigeria, hence this desperate, last-ditch effort to rescue the unproductive political instrument, now popularly referred to as godfatherism, with which he has feathered his nest and built his political empire at the expense of the people”, Osagie said in a statement. “Tinubu knows clearly that come September 19, when godfatherism would have been dismantled in Edo State, the people of Lagos may just have found the recipe and formula for removing the chokehold placed on their collective destinies for decades by Tinubu, hence the inciting television broadcast. “We call on all Edo people, friends of Nigeria and all lovers of democracy to disregard all the comments by Tinubu, as the allegations about the Edo State House of Assembly and other claims in the broadcast are completely false.”

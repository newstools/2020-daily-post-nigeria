Big Brother Naija lockdown edition third runner up, Nengi has revealed that her friendship with Prince ended because he did not have her back. Nengi in her post-eviction interview with Ebuka said Prince was all about the game and not about friendship. The duo who were friends in the first few weeks of the show stopped talking to each other before Prince’s eviction. She said, ”I felt like the period I was friends with Prince he did not really have my back. I felt Prince had a strategy because he was all about the game.” She also said she had predicted that Laycon will win the show. Nengi said, ”I knew Laycon would win. I told Dorathy at the bathroom that I felt Laycon would win, I just have these really strong instincts.”

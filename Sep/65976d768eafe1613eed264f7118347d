The Obafemi Awolowo University, OAU, has debunked the purported rumour of its resumption calculating on social media. A circular purportedly issued and signed by the University Registrar, which has gone viral, stated that the institution management has order students to resume. The Public Relations Officer of the University, Abiodun Olarewaju, in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday, tagged the circular as fake malicious both in content and context and it should be disregarded in its entirety. He stated that the University Management “wishes to officially inform our students at all levels, their parents and guardians, that the said circular is fake and malicious both in content and context and it should be disregarded in its entirety.” Recall that the Federal Government ordered the closure of higher institutions in the country over the outbreak of COVID-19 in March. The OAU, which is a Federal Government-owned institution, had been on recess sequel to the order which has not been reversed. Abiodun urged the students of the institution to remain calm, and await authentic information from the University Management as soon as the Federal Government gives the order to reopen the University. “We appreciate the patience of our students and we advise them to always remain safe,” he added.

President Muhammadu Buhari has said that his administration is doing everything within its power to put an end to the hike in the prices of food items across the country. The President in a statement released via his official Twitter account on Thursday assured Nigerians that the period of increase in food prices will be a short one. “To ease the current high cost of poultry production, I have approved the release of 30,000 tons of maize from the national reserves, to animal feed producers. “We are very mindful of the challenge of the hike of food prices, at a time when the economy is already in a slowdown which was caused by the global coronavirus pandemic. “We are doing everything in our power to ensure that the prices of food items across the country are brought down. “Let me also assure Nigerians that this situation of the hike in food prices will be a transient one. “We are also engaging with food producers associations and groups to tackle the issue of exploitative behaviour by middlemen and other actors, which is one of the factors responsible for the high food prices being experienced,” the President said.

Former Chelsea striker, Carlton Cole, has claimed that the owner of the club, Roman Abramovich, told the players he cannot do any business with Tottenham Hotspur. Abramovich pulled the plug on Cole’s move to Spurs, despite the player completing a medical with the North London side. The Blues and Tottenham share a bitter rivalry and Abramovich, who bought the Stamford Bridge club in 2003, has made sure it continues. The only player who left Chelsea to Spurs during his time as owner, was goalkeeper Carlo Cudicini, who left on a free transfer in 2009. “I almost joined Spurs. I went and did my medical and everything,” Cole told talkSPORT . “Roman Abramovich found out and he said ‘you’ve got to come back, you’re not joining them’. He said ‘you can’t go to Spurs, I don’t do business with them’.”

Erica on Wednesday night confirmed to Neo that she had sex and would be ashened to watch her videos with Kiddwaya in the HOH room when she’s out of the house. This stirred reactions from some viewers, who described Erica as being ‘cheap’ and uncultured on national Tv.

He wrote: “If you are not a Virgin, If you have ever made out and you condemn Erica because of any fabricated nonsense, then 600 years of suffering for you and your cohorts. “It’s always the struggling ones that blab, Self righteous stupidity going on everywhere! “The ones wey dem de useless for bed turn to dustbin because of small thing like transport fare and even visa or money to eat go still join de abuse Erica! Tufiakwa! “At least star girl #Bbnaija Erica is enjoying hours and hours of Billionaire orgasms not suffer head 5mins tickling.”

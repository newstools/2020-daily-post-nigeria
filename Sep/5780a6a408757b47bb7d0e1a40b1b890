Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Laycon, has demanded for more female housemates in the reality show. Laycon complained that the ratio of female housemates to male counterparts was too low and not fair to him. According to him, the weather in the house is for two people to be cuddled up. Laycon said this while speaking with Dorathy and Kiddwaya. “We need more women in the house, there are just three girls in the house how do we share them. “We have weather for two and no one to cuddle, unless we share one girl with two guys,” Laycon complained. There are six male and three female housemates; Nengi, Dorathy and Vee left in the house following the eviction of Lucy and disqualification of Erica. Recall Lucy was evicted after she scored lowest votes from viewers on Sunday.

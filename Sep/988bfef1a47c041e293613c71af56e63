Femi Fani-Kayode, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has attacked Bola Ahmed Tinubu, National leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, over his broadcast on the Saturday’s governorship election in Edo State. The former Aviation Minister said the broadcast served as nothing but comic relief, adding Tinubu may make Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu lose the governorship election. Tinubu had in a 12-minute broadcast appealed to the people of Edo State to reject Godwin Obaseki, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The former Lagos State Governor said that “Obaseki does not deserve any democratic ballot paper. Don’t vote for him, I appeal to all of you.” He further narrated how he suffered along with many others to gain democracy for the country. “I, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, want to appeal as a committed democrat, and the leader of all democrats regardless of our political parties, to our conscience and commitment to democracy today on the forthcoming election in Edo State,” he said. But reacting in a tweet on Tuesday night, Fani-Kayode said, “Tinubu’s broadcast served as nothing but comic relief. It was more of a long-winded slur and self-serving pepper soup-joint rant than a speech. “It served as nothing but a repugnant and repulsive repellant to Edo State voters and his anti-Obaseki diatribe may cost Ize Iyamu the election.”

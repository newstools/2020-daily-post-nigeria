The deceased was said to have followed two of his friends, Raheem Abdullahi and Dayo to Osun Mall in Osogbo to buy bread, where they met one other Abdulraheem Adekunle Taflad who went to the store with one of his father’s cars. The father of the deceased, simply identified as Mr Ajibola, who could not speak much, told DAILY POST that his son, Idris, was an apprentice of Aluminium fabrication and not an Internet fraudster. He asserted that Idris, who was tagged Internet fraudster by the police, came back from Sagamu in Ogun state last week where he was learning the vocation.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-840425" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200916_161506_159-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="2560" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200916_161506_159-scaled.jpg 1920w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200916_161506_159-225x300.jpg 225w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200916_161506_159-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200916_161506_159-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200916_161506_159-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"> The deceased’s elder sister, Rukayat Ajibola, urged the Inspector-General of Police, Muhammad Adamu, and the Osun state government to investigate the death of his brother. She urged the government to ensure that the matter was not swept under the carpet. She said, “I urge the government and IGP to investigate my brother’s death. The government should do something about the killing of youths in the country.” In the same vein, Damilare Opadotun, one of the uncles of the deceased described the death of Idris as a big loss to the family. According to him, “Idris went to Osun Mall with his friends, on their way back, according to one of the victims, Abdullahi, told me that they noticed JTF chasing them. “He said at some point, they pointed guns at them. But as young boys, out of fear, they could not wait, but the JTF wanted to overtake the car when they swerved out of the road.” While reacting, the Public Relations Officer of Osun Command, Yemisi Opalola, said three police officers sustained series of injuries during a protest by youths of the area and had been admitted at police hospital in Osogbo. She explained that another officer was also attacked with stones and some weapons on Tuesday at Oke-fia while coming from duty. Yemisi, during a phone interview with DAILY POST, confirmed that two protesters in Ofatedo were arrested with guns. She said, “An eyewitness came to report how protesters brutalized and attempted to kill one police officer that was just coming from duty on Tuesday. More so, three of our men were also shot”.

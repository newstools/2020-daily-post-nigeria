A baby factory has been discovered in Ile-Ife, Osun State. The location is Oroyemi Elizabeth Covenant Home and Care Centre. State government officials stormed the purported orphanage after reports that women are impregnated and their babies sold. An undergraduate and 47 children were evacuated. Olubukola Olaboopo, Women, Children and Social Affairs Commissioner, ministry officials and the police sealed off the facility. The official told The Nation that information available suggests that illegal activities have been going on for years. “We got several reports over a period of 3-4 years, of how the children in Oroyemi Elizabeth Covenant Home and Care Centre are malnourished, the environment very dirty and how some illegal activities have been going on, more or less like a baby factory. “We rescued 47 children; 10-15 adult girls were there. Those with physical disabilities, among whom is an undergraduate of Osun State Polytechnic, Iree, were among those that were rescued,” Olaboopo disclosed.

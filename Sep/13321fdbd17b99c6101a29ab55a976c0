The Governor of Kaduna State, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, has called on religious leaders to end the killings in the Southern part of the state. According to him, their reckless statements is at the root of the crisis. El-Rufai stated this on Saturday, when the National Chairman of Jama’atul Izalatul Bid’ah wa Iqamatul Sunnah, Sheikh Abdullahi Lau and other Izala leaders paid him a visit. The Governor noted that the Izala leaders came to be briefed on the security situation in Kaduna and that “they received briefings from the Commissioner of Internal Security as well as the Deputy Governor.” He said, “We also solicited their support and prayers to see the end of this crisis, because we are of the strong view that at the bottom of this crisis are the reckless statements of some religious leaders. “If religious leaders decide firmly that people should live in peace and preach that consistently, it will lead to peaceful coexistence in our state.” El-Rufai also said that the root of the crisis in southern Kaduna “lies in differences in religion and ethnicity.”

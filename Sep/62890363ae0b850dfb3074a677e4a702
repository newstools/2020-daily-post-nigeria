Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Laycon has reacted to his emergencies as a finalist of season 5. Laycon escaped eviction on Sunday and secured a spot in the finale alongside Dorathy, Vee, Nengi and Neo. After Sunday night live eviction, Laycon speaking to housemates, expressed shock that he was still in the house. According to him, he is a nobody and an artiste who was struggling in Lagos but now a finalist. Laycon said: “Who am I to have made it this far. “I’m just one artiste in Lagos that got rejected during my IT days even with my CV. “I’m a nobody but I’m in the finale. Thank God.” One of the five finalists in the Lockdown house will emerge winner of the BBNaija season 5 and go home with grand prize worth N85m next Sunday.

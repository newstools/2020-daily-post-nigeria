Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Ozo, has declared his love for fellow housemate, Nengi. The BBNaija housemate resolved never to take no for an answer from Nengi. Speaking with Nengi, in the garden, Ozo stressed that he has “fallen” for her. “I recall when I saw you the first time and thought she would be snobbish but you are far from that. “Even if you tell me no a hundred times, I am still going to fall for you.” Recall that Ozo had recently disclosed that he wants Nengi more than the N85m brand prize meant for the winner of the reality television show.

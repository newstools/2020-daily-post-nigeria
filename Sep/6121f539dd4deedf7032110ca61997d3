Arsenal legend, Ian Wright, has said his former club will experience more defeats like their 3-1 defeat to Liverpool on Monday, if they fail to land Houssem Aouar from Lyon. The Gunners took the lead through Alexandre Lacazette in the first half, but the champions struck back through Sadio Mane, Andy Robertson and Diogo Jota. Mikel Arteta selected Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, Willian and Lacazette in attack, but the Gunners were pinned back for much of the game. Arsenal improved following the introduction of Dani Ceballos from the bench in the second half. The Gunners have submitted two bids for Aouar in the last week, but Lyon are yet to receive an offer that meets their asking price. Wright has urged Arsenal to pay whatever it takes to get the Frenchman, as he feels the defeat highlighted Arteta’s need for a ball-player in midfield. “It felt like a training game for Liverpool in respect of Arsenal were saying you can try and get out but we will press you,” Wright told Premier League Productions. “You can see that in Liverpool’s team everyone can move forward because Arsenal were starting so deep but what was evident to me was that we didn’t have that person in midfield who was comfortable enough on the ball until Ceballos came on. “[They need] Someone who they can pass the ball to, who is comfortable to receive it with someone on his back, who can pop it off, who can turn it round the corner. “From there Arsenal can play but we can’t do that at the moment. That’s why it’s imperative we get Aouar from Lyon. “He’s someone that can get on the ball and get the forwards going. You saw the chances that Ceballos made when he came on. that’s what Arsenal need.”

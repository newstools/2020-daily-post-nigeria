Nyesom Ezenwo Wike, the Chairman of the PDP National Campaign Council for the Edo Governorship election, has insisted that his party has a field report of results of over 2,000 polling units. He said the results show clearly that PDP is leading in the Saturday’s election. The Rivers State governor stated this in a statement on Sunday by Paulinus Nsirim, Commissioner for Information and Communications. Wike also said that he would gladly accept the outcome of the election results if PDP, APC or any other political party wins. The statement read in part: “So, I urge both INEC and security agencies to protect all the collation centres. When that is done, everybody who has voted will be happy to see that their will has prevailed. “This may likely be the best election ever conducted in the history of Nigeria. “But they must allow the process to continue to the end. Otherwise, they’ll destroy it. “If it is APC that has won, let it be so. If it is PDP that has won, let it also be so. “But I must tell you that we are happy with what we have got. “We have a field report of results of over 2,000 polling units. It shows clearly that PDP is leading.”

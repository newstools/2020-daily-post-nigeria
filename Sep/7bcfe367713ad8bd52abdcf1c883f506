Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Ozo on Tuesday wrote a love letter to Nengi. The besotted housemate appeared to be falling deeper in love despite Nengi’s insistence that she is not interested in a relationship with him. Just yesterday Ozo disclosed he was no longer interested in his love interest. However, his denial did not last 24 hours as he again professed his love on Tuesday to Nengi. The male housemate penned down his feelings for the Bayelsa born on a serviett using lipstick. His letter read: “I know I love you because none other has made me feel this way. “You are a blessing and a kind person. I can watch you for a lifetime. You are my favorite movie.” <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-838045 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nengi.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nengi.jpeg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nengi-300x225.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px">

He said the SS1 students will resume September 28 and proceed on holiday from 6th-15 November 2020 and the JS1-SS1 will resume September 28 and end November 14. “All schools will resume for the first term 2020/2021 academic year on November 16 and end January 30th, the second term will resume February 1, 2021 and end on Thursday 1st April 2021 for the Easter break.

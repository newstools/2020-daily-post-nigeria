Erica, one of the remaining housemates in the Big Brother Naija Lockdown house, has lamented that she has no hope of seeing her lover, Kiddwaya, after the reality show. Erica suggested that Kiddwaya, the son of London-based billionaire, Terry Waya has no plans for her after the reality TV show. This is despite the fact that both housemates have had sex severally in the house. The Abia-born housemate said even though Kidd has been saying that she would see the other side of him outside the house, he does not talk of them being together despite all they share together. Erica had last night admitted having sex with Kiddwaya severally and definitely wants more from him outside the show. But Kidd has insisted that there’s no future between them, and had in more than one occasion told her he would have no time for her. He had, however, insisted that his fellow housemates will know his worth after the reality show. And during their private conversation last night, Erica said, “I’m not complaining about this. I’m not saying you have to see me but just trying to explain to you that I can’t even expect to see the other side of you. “Because you don’t even talk of seeing me outside the house, so how am I supposed to even see the second side of you when we’re outside the house? “You said I can only see the other side of you when we’re outside the house but when we’re outside the house you never talked about being with me or seeing me. “So, how am I supposed to see the other side of you? I’m only close to you inside the house as we’re here right now, that’s it.”

The Osun State Police Command has dragged a 40-year-old man, Kola Adekunle to court for threatening to kill one Isiaka Giwa with a gun. The accused person was on Monday arraigned before an Ile-Ife Magistrates’ Court over threat to life and a breach of public peace. The Prosecutor, Inspector Emmanuel Abdullahi, told the court that the accused person allegedly committed the offence on September 2, around 12:00 p.m., at Oke-Ogbo Junction in Ile-Ife. Emmanuel further alleged that the accused person threatened to kill one Isiaka Giwa with a gun if the latter failed to credit his account with N500,000. The prosecutor said the accused person had no business transaction with Giwa, who is a butcher. He told the court that the accused person approached Giwa and ordered him to pay the sum of N500,000 into his bank account, else he would kill him with a gun. He alleged that the accused person conducted himself in a manner likely to cause a breach of public peace. The offences committed contravened Sections 86 and 249(d) of the Criminal Code, Laws of Osun, 2002. The defendant, who was not legally represented, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges leveled against him. Magistrate Ibitola Oyebadejo granted the accused person bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Oyebadejo said that the sureties must swear to an affidavit of means and be residing within the court’s jurisdiction. He also said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and that one of the sureties must show evidence of three years’ tax payment. Oyebadejo adjourned the case to October 5, for hearing.

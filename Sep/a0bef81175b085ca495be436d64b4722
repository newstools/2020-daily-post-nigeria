The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has claimed that his prophecies about the Edo State governorship election ensured victory for Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Obaseki won the Saturday’s election against his closest opponent and candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu with over 80,000 votes. Primate Ayodele had consistently spoken out on issues around the Edo State election. One of his prophecies was that there will be a fight between Obaseki and a former National Chairman of the APC Adams Oshiomhole that will affect his second term ambition with the APC. He had also prophesied that Oshiomhole will not see 2023 as the national chairman of the APC. He also said it was revealed to him that Obaseki was ordained to win the election but he only needs to work against manipulation “Without mincing words, this is what the Lord said, Obaseki should be focused, do all the needful things, Obaseki will win, not Ize Iyamu, excepts APC rigs and anyone who rigs will die, just as I said COVID-19 will kill those who corrupted Nigeria,” he said. In a statement to DAILY POST on Tuesday, Ayodele said his prophecy has “just been fulfilled as he put it but that it was worthy of note that the words put Obaseki on serious alert,” he said. He added that “These prophecies also helped the people of Edo to have a direction of what God wants for them in the election, which in turn made them vote massively for Godwin Obaseki. “It is evident that Godwin Obaseki worked seriously against every form of manipulation in the election, videos were seen where he was personally searching vehicles against stolen ballot boxes,” he said.

Evicted Big Brother Naija housemate, Neo has revealed why he did not pursue a relationship with Kaisha. Neo told Ebuka on Monday that Kaisha opened up that she liked him in the house. He said although Kaisha is beautiful, he did not want to be ‘mixed up’. The Delta State-born also clarified that there was no triangle between him, Vee and Tolanbaj. ”Tolanibaj was someone I spoke about my life before and how skeptical I was about fashion, entertainment and she advised me about it. “Kaisha is a hot babe, she spoke to me that she liked me but as far as that house is concerned, I was not ready to be mixed up,” he added. Speaking on his relationship and future with Vee, Neo said, “I was not ready to ask Vee to be my girlfriend in the house. Right now I want to chase my money and meet my fans. “I won’t say there is no Vee in the picture but everyone needs to watch out for that.”

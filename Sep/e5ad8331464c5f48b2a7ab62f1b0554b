Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solsksjaer, has personally met with Thiago Alcantara, but the Premier League club is unwilling to meet the player’s current wage demands, according to Dagbladet. The 29-year-old is set to leave Bayern Munich this summer, having entered into the final year of his contract. Liverpool have been heavily linked with the Spainish midfielder, who won the Champions League with the Bundesliga side last month. However, the Reds are yet to submit an offer to Bayern, who are demanding a €30m (£27m) transfer fee for the player. Solskjaer has now spoken to Thiago to discuss a potential switch to Old Trafford this summer. But he is not prepared to sign Thiago on his current wage demands and United will not press ahead with a deal, unless the midfielder reduces his expectations.

The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) says the nationwide protests scheduled for September 23 has been moved to September 28. TUC Chairman in Lagos State, Gbenga Ekundayo, spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday. He said the postponement was for a unified protest with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). The union leader said the federal government and organised labour were yet to reach an agreement on the new prices of electricity and petrol. “TUC’s ultimatum ended today, NLC’s ultimatum will end on September 28. Those are two ultimatums, and the labour movement should not work that way. We have to harmonise our moves together. “At the national level, it was agreed that we collapse together, instead of starting something now and another joining. It was agreed that we all wait till September 28,” he said.

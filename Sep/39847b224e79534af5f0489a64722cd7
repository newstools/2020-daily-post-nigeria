A man who identified himself as Kareem Isiaka Taiwo was on Monday arrested by security agents in Ibadan for posing as an officer of Western Nigeria Security Network (WNSN), also known as Amotekun. DAILY POST gathered that Taiwo tried to defraud people by claiming to be the recruitment officer for the new security outfit. It was gathered that Taiwo on Sunday pasted a notice at the Adamasingba Stadium venue of the Stateâ€™s recruitment screening center with his name and phone number, asking those interested in joining the Amotekun Corps to contact him. Following investigations, Taiwo was then arrested at 11:45am on Monday. He has now been handed over to security agents for prosecution. Chairman, Oyo State Security Network Agency (Amotekun Corps), General Kunle Toogun (rtd.) confirmed the arrest. He said the general public should be wary of fraudsters in their quest to become members of the corps.

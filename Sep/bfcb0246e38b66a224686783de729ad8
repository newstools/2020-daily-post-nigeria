President Muhammadu Buhari has advised political parties, candidates and security agents to behave responsibly during the Edo governorship election. His message was contained in a statement Thursday night by presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu. “I am passionately committed to free and fair elections, but my own commitment is not enough if other actors at ground zero refuse to abide by the rules”, it read. Buhari said he wants to see democratic standards in the country raised higher at every level. “These cannot be achieved when politicians resort to do or die methods to gain power by any means or machination.” The president added that “the do-or-die mentality to politics is a threat to free and fair elections because the actors are more focused on winning than caring about a fair outcome that reflects the Will of the people.” He appealed to all political parties and their candidates to behave peacefully and respect law and order. The Nigerian leader advised election officials and security operatives to remain neutral, ensure free elections and avoid actions capable of compromising the integrity of the elections. “Conducting free and fair elections is one of my main concerns for our democracy, and I want this commitment to be one of the legacies I will leave behind when I depart office,” Buhari added.

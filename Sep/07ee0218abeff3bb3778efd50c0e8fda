Vee and Neo, two of the finalists in the Big Brother Naija Lockdown, were caught on camera last night kissing passionately after they cemented their places in the last five. Neo, Vee and Nengi yesterday secured their places in the grand finale of the BBN season 5. Nengi, a 22-year-old Bayelsa-born, got a spot in the finale after she won the Head of House challenge. However, the only lovers left in the house, Neo and Vee on the other hand escaped nomination for eviction this week. Vee had earlier described the development as miraculous, promising to stand by Neo always. Both housemates, obviously the only surviving relationship in the lockdown house, were seen holding tight and locking lips as a way to celebrate their success.

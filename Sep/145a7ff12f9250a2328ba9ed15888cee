Barcelona midfielder, Arturo Vidal, has insisted that he would be happy to join his former teammate, Andrea Pirlo at Juventus. Vidal’s future at Barcelona is uncertain after the club put up all senior players for sale this summer. Vidal and Pirlo, who is now the new coach of Juventus, spent four years together at the Turin club and won four Serie A titles. The Chile international has now disclosed his desire to reunite with Pirlo at Juventus this summer, adding that the Italian legend has a real vision of the game of football. “It is spectacular that he [Pirlo] has become the coach of Juventus,” Vidal told Daniel Habif’s YouTube channel. “If he was incredible as a player, imagine him as a coach. He has a real vision of the sport that very few have ever had in football, so I think he can do really well. “Pirlo is also a wonderful person too, so I can only imagine he will be a great coach. We spent four years together and won Serie A four times, so if he were to call me, I would be happy.”

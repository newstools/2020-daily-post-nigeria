Mathew Adebayo, a teacher in a private secondary school, has admitted raping a 15-year-old student on several occasions during the ongoing West African Senior School Certificate Examination, police have said. Adebayo has been arrested by the police in Ogun State police “for forcefully having unlawful carnal knowledge” of the victim. The Ogun State Police Command, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST that the said teacher was arrested when the proprietress of the unnamed school reported the incident at Sango police station. The owner of the school had told the police that she got information from one of her SS3 students that “the suspect had been raping her repeatedly since the resumption of the school in preparation for the West African Senior School Certificate Examination.” “She stated further that the said teacher intimidated the victim by telling her that she will not pass the WAEC exams, if she didn’t allow him having sex with her, consequence upon which he has been calling her out of the dormitory in the night and taking her to a classroom where he used to have carnal knowledge of her.” According to Oyeyemi, when the victim could no longer bear the sexual assault of the “randy teacher”, she reported to the proprietress. With the report, the DPO of Sango Police Division, CSP Godwin Idehai, reportedly detailed his men to the scene where the suspect was arrested. Police spokesman said “he has since then made a confessional statement admitting the commission of the crime.” The victim, it was gathered, has been taken to hospital. The State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun has ordered the transfer of the case to the Anti-human trafficking and child labour unit of the State CIID.

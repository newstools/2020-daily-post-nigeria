The federal government has approved October 11 as reopening date for all Unity Schools in Nigeria. Adamu Adamu, Minister of Education, made the announcement in a letter he signed on Wednesday. The minister said the approval was for students in Junior Secondary School and Senior Secondary School. Adamu noted that students at home since the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic can now complete their academic session which ends in December. He advised that COVID-19 protocols be strictly observed in the schools. “Schools that have not concluded their 2nd term examination should round off and commence 3rd term immediately which is expected to end in December,” the minister wrote.

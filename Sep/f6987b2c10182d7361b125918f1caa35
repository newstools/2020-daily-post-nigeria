Atiku Abubakar, a former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has appealed to Edo people to protect their votes. He made the call Saturday evening on Twitter. Counting of votes is going on in some areas, while the results of some units are being declared. Atiku told the people not to relax on vigilance. He tweeted, ”Well done Edo for coming out to decide. But that’s not where it ends. As the saying goes, eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. ”In this case, let’s say vigilance is the price required to make your vote count. We must not lose our guards on this.”

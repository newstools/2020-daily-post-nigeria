The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Command, CP Hakeem Odumosu has warned that the security agency would not be at ease with traffic offenders especially those who drive against traffic, those on the BRT lanes as well as motorcyclists who operate in the restricted areas across the state. The Police boss, who condemned the act as criminal and unacceptable, gave the matching order to Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers, and Heads of Operational and tactical units in Lagos State on Monday during a routine briefing with the officers at the Conference Hall, State Headquarters, GRA, Ikeja. He charged the officers and men of the command to go after and ostracize cultists or any illegal or unlawful society within the state, saying their existence and operations are purely illegal. He vowed that henceforth, every Divisional Police Officer would be accountable and responsible for violation of any traffic law and uprising cult-related cases in their areas within the length and breadth of Lagos State. Odumosu then assured the general public of his commitment to getting Lagos State rid of criminal acts, social vices and violation of traffic rules in Lagos State.

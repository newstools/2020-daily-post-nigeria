A group of politicians in Imo State on Tuesday, stormed the Secretariat of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Owerri accusing the electoral umpire of wrongly shortlisting Frank Ibezim as the party’s candidate for the forthcoming Okigwe zone senatorial election. DAILY POST reports that the protesters numbering up to 300 submitted a petition to INEC against the APC candidate. The group is alleged to be working for Ifeanyi Araraume, an aspirant in the APC primaries. It will be recalled that the APC had earlier submitted the name of a former Commissioner for Agriculture, Frank Ibezim, to INEC as its candidate for the election soon after the party’s primaries. The group’s spokesperson, Raymond Aguguo who spoke to newsmen said that Ifeanyi Araraume won the APC primary election and should be allowed to represent the party at the polls. Aguguo further alleged that Frank Ibezim was disqualified by the screening panel based on an alleged inconsistency in his academic credentials. Our state correspondent reported that the protesters were later prevented from having access into the INEC complex by policemen who barricaded them. One of the supporters of the APC candidate, Obinwanne Onwuchuruba, urged the former senator, Ifeanyi Araraume and his supporters to accept Ibezim’s emergence in good fate.

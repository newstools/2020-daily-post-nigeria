Evicted Big Brother Naija lockdown housemate Brighto has chosen Wathoni over Dorathy. Both Dora and Wathoni have been in a love triangle with the Edo-born former housemate. While in the lockdown house there was confusion as to whom Brighto liked the most as both female housemates showed interest in him. Wathoni had accused Dorathy of using her to get to Brighto after a conversation to figure out his feelings. But when asked to choose between the two during one of his media tours, Brighto said, “I choose Wathoni.”

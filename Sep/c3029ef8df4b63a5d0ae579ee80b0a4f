Tottenham Hotspur’s medical team has confirmed Gareth Bale will be unavailable for selection for at least one month with an injury, Marca reports. Bale arrived in London on Friday alongside Real Madrid team-mate Sergio Reguilon, who joins on a permanent deal, to finalise the deal. The 31-year-old has been carrying an injury, but has been working in a gym at Valdebebas. However, the Spurs medical team took a look at Bale’s injury and determined he will be out for as many as four weeks. It appears that Tottenham knew this may be the case in advance, meaning the £20million loan transfer will still go through. But Jose Mourinho will have to wait until October or even November, to have Bale fit and ready to play.

Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has congratulated the Chairman of the PDP National Campaign Council for the Edo Governorship election and Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, for leading the party to victory at the just-concluded Edo State governorship election. Fayose said this while reacting to Gov. Godwin Obaseki’s victory at the just-concluded Edo State governorship election. He also urged Obaseki to remain in the PDP, adding that the outcome of the Edo State election has shown once again that Nigeria can have free, fair and credible elections. “The outcome of the Edo State election has shown once again that we can have free, fair and credible elections if those in control of the FG allow @inecnigeria and security agencies to do their jobs without interference,” Fayose wrote on Twitter on Sunday. “Gov Obaseki should remain in the @OfficialPDPNig, not minding the pressure that will be mounted on him. “I also congratulate the people of Edo State, Nigerians and most importantly, the PDP for this sweet victory. “Most importantly, I congratulate my friend and “younger brother”, Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for leading the PDP to this very important electoral victory. “May this mark the beginning of that all-important deliverance of Nigeria and its people from the bondage of APC.”

A Chief Magistrates’ Court sitting in Kano State on Friday, remanded a 45-year-old driver, Usman Aliyu, at a correctional centre for allegedly defiling his three nieces. The defendant, who resides at Tumfafi Village in Dawakin Tofa Local Government Area (LGA) of the state, is facing a two-count charge of rape and incest. The Prosecutor, Insp. Pogu Lale told the court that one Aisha Usman of Hotoro Quarters Kano reported the case at Hotoro Police Division on August 5. He said that on August 3, the complainant discovered that her three daughters aged between six and ten were defiled by their uncle. “The victims earlier told their stepmother about the incident, but were not taken seriously,” he said. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. Lale said the offence contravenes sections 283 and 390 of the penal code. The Chief Magistrate, Muhammad Jibril, ordered the remand of the defendant and the case file sent to the state Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. Jibril adjourned the case until Sept.14 for mention.

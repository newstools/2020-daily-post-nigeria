Tea and Bread sellers in Jigawa State have threatened to embark on industrial action over the increase in the price of bread by master bakers. Umar Isah Jahun chairman tea and bread sellers association Jigawa State branch disclosed this in an exclusive interview with DAILY POST in Dutse. He said the bakers in the state have increased #50 for each loaf of bread without considering the current situation. “We have condemned their action in totality, therefore, if they refused to revert to an old price we have no other option than to boycott the bakers who have increased the price or embarked on strike” Umar urged the government to intervene to halt the increased price of bread which is the last option of the common man. He appealed to the federal and state governments to look into the increasing prices of all commodities for the benefit of all. Chairman bakers association Jigawa State chapter said the hike in price is due to the prices of flour, sugar, and other baking ingredients. He said the members of the association had last week embarked on a strike for two days to register their dismay over the price of flour and other baking ingredients.

The Assistant Inspector-General of Police, Zone 2 Command, Ahmed Iliyasu, while parading the suspects on Wednesday, said they were responsible for multiple kidnapping in Yewa North Local Government Area of Ogun State. Iliyasu said the herdsmen used to lay ambush on the Ayetoro-Abeokuta road to attack their victims. DAILY POST has earlier reported the shooting of the driver and the abduction of a female police Inspector by the suspects during the COVID-19 lockdown. Iliyasu, during a press briefing at the command headquarters, Onikan, Lagos, informed that the suspects also abducted an officer of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), adding that a ransom of N3 million was paid for his freedom. It was learnt that the syndicate was also responsible for the kidnap and killing of a cattle herder, known as Alhaji Oro.

The suspects were identified by Iliyasu as Adamu Saliu, Abubakar Sadiq, Tambaye Mohammed, Adamu Sulaiman, Ibrahim Mohammed and Akanni Musa; saying they would be prosecuted.

Governor Hope Uzodinma of Imo State has warned against tribal sentiments in deciding candidates for the 2023 presidential election. Uzodinma said presidential candidates should come on the basis of party system and not tribal basis. The governor stated this while addressing State House correspondents after a closed-door meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa in Abuja. Uzodinma said Nigeria was practicing democracy and not tribal democracy. “We are practicing partisan democracy, not tribal democracy. So, the emergence of presidential candidates will come on a party-by-party basis, not tribe-by-tribe basis,” Uzodinma said. Uzodinma’s comment is coming at a time when some Nigerians have been advocating Southeast presidency in 2023. Former Abia State Governor, Orji Uzor Kalu had expressed his readiness to contest for presidency, if called upon.

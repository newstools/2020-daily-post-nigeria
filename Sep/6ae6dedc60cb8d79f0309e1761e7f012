Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, has said he did not take part in the party’s campaigns before the just concluded Edo State elections. APC’s candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu lost to the incumbent and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Governor Godwin Obaseki. Speaking to reporters in Benin City, the state capital, Oyegun said “I cannot support injustice” and will only do what his conscience doesn’t consider wrong. “Let me put it this way: I am a man of conscience. I am a strong believer in justice and fair play. I am a strong believer that when the rules of an association you belong to have been so flagrantly disregarded, put aside, not complied with, then, you have to go back to your conscience to say, can I support what has happened? I cannot support injustice. “In terms of going out to work for injustice, I hope you get the meaning? Going out, to say, what I in my conscience I considered wrong, I am not supporting working for it, to be instituted, l cannot do that. And normal people should not do that. Your loyalty in life should be what is right, that is principle. “Don’t forget, at every point, my views were known and it is not that I hide and I said nothing,” Oyegun explained.

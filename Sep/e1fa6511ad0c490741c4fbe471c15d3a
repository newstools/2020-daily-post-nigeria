Felix Okoro, a former Nigerian Ambassador to Venezuela has been freed by his captors. The former Secretary to Bayelsa State Government was held for 23 days. The All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain represented Bayelsa West Senatorial District in the Senate. Okoro was seized on September 4 at his hometown, Elemebiri in Sagbama Local Government Area. The gunmen, reportedly dressed in army uniform, stormed his home one day after his return. The Nation quoted Okoro’s stepson, Tuebi Sapre-Obi, as saying three family members travelled by boat to drop N11m ransom. “Father (Felix Oboro) is strong and in a healthy state. When the news of his release came, everyone was happy and jubilating”, he said. Former Secretary, Civil Liberties Organisation (CLO), Morris Alagoa and Ijaw Youth Council Worldwide (IYC) spokesman, Ebilade Eerekefe, condemned the abduction. They urged security agencies to track and arrest the culprits.

A High Court sitting in Jos on Wednesday ordered that a 25-year-old man, Adamu Garba be remanded in a correctional centre for sexually assaulting three minor girls. The Prosecution Counsel, Mr M.A. Chup, Ministry of Justice, while presenting the case, told the court that the defendant lured the minors aged 8, 9 and 10 to an uncompleted building and sexually assaulted them. Chup said that the offence contravened the provisions of Section 208 of the Plateau State Penal Code of 2007. According to him, a statement which was written by the accused at the police station after he was arrested showed he admitted that he lured the minors with Guava fruit. “The girls live in my area, they always come around my house and each time I see them, I offer them guava and put them on my lap,” the accused said. However, Justice Nafisat Musa, ordered that Garba be remanded in a correction centre, though he pleaded not guilty to the crime. He adjourned the matter until Nov. 18, for hearing, NAN reports.

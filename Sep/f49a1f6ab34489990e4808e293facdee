Premier League clubs are on red alert to sign Barcelona’s Antoine Griezmann, who is ‘the biggest loser’ from Lionel Messi’s decision to remain at the club, SportsMail reports. Griezmann had been promised the ‘Messi role’ by new manager Ronald Koeman had the Argentine legend left the Nou Camp. But those plans have taken a hit, following the Argentine’s u-turn on Friday. Koeman now needs to trim his squad to cater for Messi and allow young talents like 17-year-old Ansu Fati and winger Ousmane Dembele shine. Though Barca are open to selling Philippe Coutinho, Koeman wants to have a look at the Brazilian midfielder who won the Champions League with Bayern Munich last season. That leaves 29-year-old Griezmann particularly vulnerable, having failed to shine at the Camp Nou following his £107million move from Atletico Madrid last summer, scoring only nine goals in La Liga.

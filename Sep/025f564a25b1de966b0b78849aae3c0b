Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajia Sadiya Farouq, has given update on the payment of stipends to beneficiaries of N-Power. Farouq on Thursday at the interactive forum with state focal persons for the Social Investment Programmes held in Abuja, appealed to beneficiaries of Batch B to be patient, adding that their payment is still being processed and would be implemented soon. She added that the government is also working out plans to integrate beneficiaries of the batches A and B exited in June and July respectively. She said:” I wish to reiterate that I have given approval for the payment of stipends for the exited beneficiaries of batches A and B up to the month of June 2020 including that of the independent monitors. “The final payment of stipend for Batch B is almost ready for transmission to the office of the Accountant General of the Federation for final checks and payment.” The minister appealed to Batch B beneficiaries omitted for payment to exercise more patience. “I, therefore, appeal for patience and understanding from beneficiaries omitted for payment in previous months and those in batch B who are to get their final payment,” she added.

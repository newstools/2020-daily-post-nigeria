Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya has advised Ozo on steps to take to win the heart of his love interest Nengi. Kiddwaya on Saturday advised Ozo to focus on making money adding that it would be expensive to maintain a relationship with Nengi outside the house. According to him, there would be less chance for him to be in a relationship with Nengi outside the house without money. Kiddwaya tells Ozo: ” Nengi is the kind of girl that if her guy is worried about other guys paying her attention/giving gifts she won’t like it. “If you focus on making money and being a success then every other thing will fall into place. Guys will be reaching out to Nengi in her DMs with gifts and all of that outside the house and it will be expensive to maintain a relationship.”

Barely 10 days to the governorship election in Edo State, another Commissioner, Mr. Joseph Ikpea on Wednesday resigned his position from the cabinet of Governor Godwin Obaseki. Until his resignation, Ikpea was the Commissioner for Minerals, Oil and Gas in the state. In the letter dated September 9 and addressed to the Governor, Ikpea cited reasons of trust, respect and interest for his resignation. He also attributed his reason to his inability to abandon the party (All Progressives Congress) he has helped to nurture in his council area and the state in general. According to him, ‘Politics is all about interest, trust and respect for one another, but I have never seen any of this till date, and I am also not sure of it even if I am there tomorrow. ‘Moreover, the party that is known today as APC was brought to Esan South East by me and over 90 percent of my supporters are APC members till date. ‘So, it is difficult for me to leave the house that I built. Considering also that this administration didn’t recognise my leadership role,” he stated. Ikpea, however, said he would always be available to provide support to the government whenever called upon to do so.

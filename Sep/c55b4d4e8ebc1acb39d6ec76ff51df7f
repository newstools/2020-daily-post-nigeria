Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand predicted that defending champions, Liverpool are favourites to win the 2020/21Premier League this season. Ferdinand also said that the likes of Manchester City, Chelsea and Manchester United could challenge Liverpool for the Premier League title if Jurgen Klopp’s side are plagued by injuries. Liverpool won the Premier League title last season by 18 points gap ahead of second-placed Man City. But Ferdinand believes the Reds could well defend the English top-flight title if crucial players such as Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Virgil van Dijk stay fit throughout the season. “No one can say Liverpool had a freak season because they finished so far ahead of their rivals,” Ferdinand told TEAMtalk. “The key for Liverpool has been having their key players fit for the best part of two seasons. “Virgil van Dijk has played nearly every game for two seasons, and it is hard to keep that going. Mo Salah has been fit for all the big games, and so has Sadio Mane. “If they lose one of two of their players with big injuries, then we’ll see something else from them.” He added: “Their front three have been fit consistently, and they might need to look at having some better quality in reserve if Salah or Mane, in particular, are out for a long period. “If they can continue to keep those players fit, I do not see Liverpool being stopped this season. “If things change with the personnel, it opens it up for the other teams and not just Man City.”

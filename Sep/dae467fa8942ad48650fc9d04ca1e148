Kiddwaya has warned fellow Big Brother Naija lockdown housemates that from next week he would be harsh on whoever remains in the house after the Sunday live eviction. Kidd said this while responding to his lover, Erica who said “When you try to be diplomatic all the time, it does not work especially when you are living with them. You only get diplomatic when you’re not going to be seeing them. The Benue-born then vowed to put fellow housemates in check if he survives evictions on Sunday. “It sounds like I’m being so harsh but I’ll tell you the gospel truth, I’ll behave so differently to many of them. “Next week whoever is here, I’ll check some people but for now let’s look for survival. ” Recall that Kiddwaya had yesterday complained bitterly to Biggie that some housemates were disrespecting his lover, Erica, who is the current head of house in the reality show.

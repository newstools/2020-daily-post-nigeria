Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has mocked the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Adams Oshiomhole as results of Edo governorship election trickle in. Governor Godwin Obaseki, who contested Saturday’s governorship election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is in an early lead as results come in. Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu seems to be behind Obaseki despite support from Oshiomhole and Tinubu. Omokri, reacting to the results announced so far by INEC, said the forces of godfatherism are being shamed in Edo. According to the former presidential aide, results from Edo governorship election proves that Edo is different from Lagos State. Omokri on his Twitter handle wrote: “me The @OfficialPDPNig is coasting to an easy victory in Edo, going by official @INECNigeria results so far released. “The forces of godfatherism are being shamed. Oshiomhole and Bola @AsiwajuTinubu now know that Edo is definitely not Lagos!”

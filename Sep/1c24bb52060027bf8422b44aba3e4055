Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, SAN, on Tuesday said the United States, US, and the European Union, EU, determined the outcome of the just concluded governorship election in Edo State. Adegboruwa, who is an activist lawyer explained that whoever these forces favour would always emerge winner of an election in Nigeria. Recall that the incumbent Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had defeated his closest rival, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu to emerge winner of the just concluded governorship election. Prior to the election, the US had threatened to place a Visa ban on some top politician over their involvement in electoral malpractices in Kogi and Bayelsa States election. However, Adegboruwa in his reaction to the outcome of the poll, said the Visa ban threat stopped politicians from indulging in electoral malpractice. In a statement he signed, the Senior lawyer also commended President Muhammadu Buhari over the outcome of the election. He further applauded the people of Edo State for their vigilance during the just concluded gubernatorial election in the state. According to Adegboruwa: “My Take on Edo Election: “Edo Election was determined by the US, EU and the western powers. As simple as that. Whoever they favour will always carry the day.
So it was in 2015 so it is now. “Our leaders are scared to be placed under visa restrictions, where they may not be able to access their loot and have opportunity for good medical treatment. “This is what has led to peace in Edo. “If America and the Western powers want it, election in Nigeria will always be free. “Secondly, whether we agree or not, President Buhari has also shown himself to be a good leader, in allowing the will of the people to prevail. “Above it all, we salute the courage of the Edo electorate, very enlightened and vigilant.”

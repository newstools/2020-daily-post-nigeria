The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Nigerian Army of interference in the Edo governorship election. The PDP raised the alarm Saturday evening. The party said soldiers are occupying Owan West collation centre. “#EdoDecides2020-Men of the @HQNigerianArmy have taken over Sobe collation centre in Owan West LGA”, the platform tweeted. “They are chasing away party agents &observers from the collation centre. Nigerians should hold the @HQNigerianArmy responsible if anything happens to the results from Owan West LGA.” Meanwhile, former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has appealed to Edo people to protect their votes. Counting of votes is going on in some areas, while the results of some units are being declared. Saraki told the people not to relax on vigilance. “The on-going #EdoDecides2020 is getting to the crucial stages. I urge the good people of Edo State not to get carried away but to protect their votes”, the former Kwara Governor tweeted. “The enthusiasm and patriotic conduct of the good people of Edo State must not be thwarted or subverted by any @inecnigeria official, either permanent or ad-hoc; or any security personnel, no matter the rank. “Nigeria’s glory is more important than the huge ego of politicians. And so @inecnigeria and security officials must work to protect Nigeria’s image and not to satisfy the whims and caprices of some power-hungry politicians.”

Chairman, Northern Traditional Rulers Council and Sultan of Sokoto, Dr. Sa’ad Abubakar (III), on Monday, in Kaduna, described the killings in the southern part of the state as “madness” that has to be stopped immediately. He called on those involved in killings in Southern Kaduna to stop the act, saying, “enough is enough”. Speaking during a Council’s Executive meeting in Kaduna, the monarch noted that no man in his right senses go on a killing spree of innocent people under whatever guise. The Sultan carpeted politicians as forces behind the unrests in the southern part of the state. He called on the people of the state and Nigeria in general that no politicians mean well for them, adding, “lf you keep on igniting killings based on ethno-religious differences because it is the innocent children that are killed while that of the elites are protected.” Earlier, Kaduna State Governor, Malam Nasir El-Rufai, reminded the gathering that, the Southern Kaduna crises had prevailed for the past 40 years since the first Kasuwan Magani riot. According to the governor, Kaduna is a mini-Nigeria with over 52 ethnic groups, meaning that 10 percent of Nigeria’s ethnic groups are from Kaduna state. He added that the danger of it is that, crimes committed by criminals for their own selfish motives were given ethno-religious interpretations. Speaking on what his administration has been doing to abate the killings El-Rufai said, “a military base, Mobile Police Depot, Air Force and strike force personnel have been deployed to the zone. “Also, equipment like drones and GSM trackers are being used which had helped to neutralized thousands of the bandits in the State. We also set up a Peace Commission to meidate between the aggrieved people.”

Protests erupted in the major street of the state capital when the news of the fight filtered in, the keke driver was then taken to the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Yenagoa, but didn’t survive. DAILY POST gathered that angry Keke riders invaded the office of the Taskforce located at the Swali road and burnt it down.

He said ”how can we achieve anything with the numerous taxes imposed by different agents of the government, even the police and road safety will still not let us rest. They are all thugs who are always drunk and standing on the road to enforce payment and collection of tax. We suffer a lot from them over multiple taxes. According to the Bayelsa State Chairman of Tricycle Operators/ Owners Association of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Adokeme, the deceased only slumped and died while arguments were still on, adding that nobody beat or fought him. He said “The Taskforce personnel held him for not having tickets which is very normal; the deceased through eyewitness account said he would kill himself if he wasn’t left alone during the argument and later we heard that he died” But we have been meeting with the various groups for them to sheath their sword and remain calm, we all have to see ourselves as partners in progress. The operators should know that there’s government on ground, and they must abide by all rules and regulations which make everyone a corporate citizen.

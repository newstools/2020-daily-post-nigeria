Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., the National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has advised members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to limit their celebration of the outcome of the governorship election in Edo State because Governor Godwin Obaseki may soon return to the All Progressives Congress, APC. Governor Obaseki left the APC for the PDP a few months to the governorship election after he was disqualified by the ruling party. Obaseki was, however, declared elected for a second tenure in office by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC on Sunday after he defeated candidate of the APC, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu with over 100,000 votes. The incumbent Governor had an arduous journey having contended with the duo of the APC National Leader, Bola Tinubu and a former National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. But Bamgbose noted that, “Tinubu went extra mile to frustrate Obaseki, but he failed woefully. Edo voters clipped his big wings. “On the other hand, Oshiomhole exhausted his political arsenal, but met his waterloo. “Obaseki’s victory has finally nailed his political coffin. His political career has dishonorably come to an end. It’s really painful. “However, PDP should not rejoice much, because Obaseki may soon stage a comeback to APC, other things being equal. “Obaseki made a statement before pulling out of APC, that his discussions with President Buhari will determine his next step. “It’s most likely that Obaseki struck a deal with President Buhari to return back to APC, after winning the election. “It’s no longer news that President Buhari has already congratulated Obaseki on his re-election as Governor of Edo State. Many have been commending him for allowing free and fair election in Edo State. “President Buhari ensured the governorship election was free and fair in view of possibly, the agreement they had before he decamped to PDP. It’s most likely Obaseki will go back to APC.”

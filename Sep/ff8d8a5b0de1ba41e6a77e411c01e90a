Inter Milan have revealed their final decision as the football world awaits the next destination of Barcelona’s Lionel Messi. The Italian giants said they have no plans to try and sign the Argentine forward nor the financial means to engineer a deal for him. Inter Milan were said to be one of the big European clubs in the front row to sign the Barcelona captain. Messi had last week told the Catalan giants that he was ready to leave the club. “I don’t know where some ideas can come from,” Inter sporting director Piero Ausilio told Sky Sport Italia. Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are the other clubs said to be in pursuit of the superstar if he leaves Barcelona. “No coach, no president wouldn’t want Messi in their team. But the reality is very different,” Ausilio added. The Italian transfer window officially opened on Tuesday. “Our reality is a sensible transfer market,” he insisted.

Chelsea have sent Ross Barkley out on a one-year loan at Aston Villa. The move was confirmed by the Midlands club on Wednesday morning. Barkley was left out of Frank Lampard’s squad that lost 5-4 on penalties to Tottenham Hotspur in the Carabao Cup. The 26-year-old has been an unused substitute in Chelsea’s last two matches. He only started one game this season – a 6-0 Carabao Cup win over Barnsley in which he scored. Barkley has fallen down the pecking order under Lampard, following the summer arrivals of Kai Havertz and Hakim Ziyech. He has now decided to join Villa to get more playing time.

Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard, has commented on goalkeeper Eduoard Mendy’s performance following his side’s Carabao Cup fourth-round defeat to Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday night. Timo Werner scored his first goal for Chelsea to give them a 19th-minute lead, but Jose Mourinho’s side was level with seven minutes left. Erik Lamela prodded the ball past Mendy, after a mix-up between Kurt Zouma and Fikayo Tomori as the match ended 1-1. Tottenham went on to win 5-4 via penalty kicks after Chelsea’s Mason Mount missed his spot-kick. Speaking after the game, Lampard said at his post-match press conference that he was very pleased with Mendy’s display against Spurs, adding that the Senegalese international took good command of his box. “I thought he [Mendy] was very good,” Lampard said. “He made a couple of good saves. Came and caught a few balls. Very very pleased with every part of his game.” Chelsea’s next match is against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Saturday. —

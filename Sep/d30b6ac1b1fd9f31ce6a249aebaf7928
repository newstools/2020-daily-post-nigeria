Sequel to the collapse of a school building in Ejigbo in the early hours of Saturday, the Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu has directed the Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development to carry out integrity tests on both public and private schools with buildings of 3 floors and above. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr. Idris Salako disclosed that the Governor gave this directive at a press briefing in the State House later on Saturday. Salako stated that the move became necessary in order to ascertain the structural integrity of all school buildings above 2 floors with a view to preventing future re-occurrence of school building collapse in the State. The Commissioner assured that the Ministry would swing into action in earnest so as to actualise the State Governmentâ€™s aim of saving lives and property, especially as schools resume after a long break due to the Covid-19 pandemic. He explained further that the Ministry would soon come up with the guidelines and procedure for the integrity test on public and private schools whose buildings fall within the stated range.

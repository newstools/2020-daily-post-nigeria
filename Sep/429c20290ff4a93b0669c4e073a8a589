Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, will be without four of his new signings, for their trip to Brighton on Monday night. The Blues kick off their Premier League season today, knowing that two of their rivals Arsenal and Liverpool, have began with wins. However, Lampard will have to make do with the German duo of Timo Werner and Kai Havertz. Ziyech and Chilwell are nursing knee and heel injuries respectively. Silva joined up with the team last week for training and is not deemed match fit yet. However, Christian Pulisic is pushing for a place in the starting XI after recovering from injury. Lampard faces a decision over whether to recall Kepa Arrizabalaga or keep faith with Willy Caballero in goal. Chelsea squad vs Brighton: Kepa Arrizabalaga, Willy Caballero, Cesar Azpilicueta, Reece James, Antonio Rudiger, Fikayo Tomori, Juan Castillo, Andreas Christensen, Kurt Zouma, Marcos Alonso, Emerson Palmieri, Jorginho, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Ross Barkley, Mason Mount, Kai Havertz, Nâ€™Golo Kante, Christian Pulisic, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Tammy Abraham, Olivier Giroud, Timo Werner.

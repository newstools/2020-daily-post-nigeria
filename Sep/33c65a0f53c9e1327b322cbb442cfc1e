Liverpool midfielder, Gini Wijnaldum, has claimed that speculations linking him with a move to Barcelona are rumours. Wijnaldum stated this while on speaking to the media on international duty with the Netherlands. The 29-year-old is out of contract in June 2021 and has not begun talks over a new deal with the Premier League champions. Wijnaldum arrived on Merseyside from Newcastle in 2016, but still earns £75,000 a week despite his impressive performances. With Liverpool also being linked with Bayern Munich’s Thiago Alcantara, there have been suggestions that they will be willing to part with Wijnaldum in order to complete the deal. When asked about the stories, Wijnaldum simply said: “It’s a rumour, I have nothing to say about it.”

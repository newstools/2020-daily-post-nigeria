Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Laycon, has reacted to Erica’s disqualification from the Lockdown house. Erica was disqualified from the show after she got third strike from Biggie for violating the house rules. Erica got disqualified after Biggie gathered the housemates at the lounge and played videos of when she threatened to kill Laycon outside the house and hurled insults at him. Also, video of her pouring water on the Head of House (HoH) bed in order to stop Prince who is her deputy from sharing the lounge with her was highlighted. Reacting to her disqualification, Laycon in a conversation with Kiddwaya and Vee said he feels sorry for her, saying her actions were because she was drunk. When asked if he feels responsible for her eviction, Laycon said no, adding that she’s the architect of her predicament. Laycon said: “She was talking , all the things she said and action caused her eviction. “I felt she was drunk and said all those things.” Erica’s disqualification from the reality show alongside Lucy’s eviction has left nine housemates in the house to battle for the grand prize of N85m.

Former Liverpool and Real Madrid striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Arsenal to beat Fulham 3-1 when both sides clash in Saturday’s Premier League opener at Craven Cottage. Arsenal head to the game after losing 3-2 to Aston Villa in a pre-season friendly last Saturday. Providing his prediction, Owen wrote in his column for BetVictor: “Scott Parker has done a superb job in getting Fulham back into the Premier League, but of course, the real challenge is keeping them up, and that will undoubtedly be the number one target for the Cottagers this season. “Mikel Arteta has had a great start to his managerial career at Arsenal with a couple of trophies already in the bag courtesy of their FA Cup win just a few weeks ago and followed up with a win over Liverpool in the Community Shield. “I think they will have lofty ambitions for the upcoming season and I wouldn’t be at all surprised to see them pushing hard for a place in the top four at the end of the season. “I fancy a comfortable 3-1 win for the Gunners in this one.” The kick-off for the match is 12:30 pm.

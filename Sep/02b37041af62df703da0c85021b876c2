Two men on Wednesday appeared in a Grade I Area Court for allegedly defrauding a businessman of N1.4 million. The police charged Elum Chibueze and Ogundele Micheal with a joint act of criminal breach of trust and cheating. According to NAN the Prosecution Counsel, John Okpa, told the court that police investigations into a direct criminal complaint revealed that the defendants fraudulently obtained the N1.4 million from the complainant, Arise Okoronkwo. It was gathered that the defendants collected the money for a non-existent piece of land in Bwari Area Council, FCT. The defendants, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. In their defence, Counsel, Moses Ugwummadu, urged the court to grant bail to his clients in the most liberal terms. Ugwummadu added that a reliable surety would be provided if granted. The Judge, Mr Muhammad Adamu, admitted the defendants to bail in the sum of N500, 000 each with one reasonable surety each in like sum. Adamu ordered that the sureties must reside within the courtâ€™s jurisdiction and present means of identification. He adjourned the case until Oct.14 for hearing.

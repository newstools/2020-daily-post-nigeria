A former Military Head of State, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, has urged Nigerians to be patriotic and disciplined so that the country can experience meaningful development. Abubakar made the call while addressing newsmen ahead of the 60th Independence Anniversary of Nigeria in Minna on Wednesday, NAN reports. The General said that for the country to attain greatness, all hands must be on deck and Nigerians must contribute their own quota in governance. “For Nigeria to attain greatness, we must become a disciplined society. It is unfortunate that there is still indiscipline in the country. People don’t obey rules and regulations set by the government. “Every Nigerian is expected to do their best. Desist from sabotage and assist the government in its effort to improve the country’s economy,” he said. He also called on governments at all levels to carry out their responsibilities by providing infrastructures, adequate power and assisting farmers with farm inputs in order to make life easier for the teeming populations. “Nigerians must assist the government by exposing miscreants living among us so that the security agencies can arrest and deal with them decisively,” he added. He, however, called on Nigerians to be awake to their responsibilities and hold their elected leaders responsible and accountable.

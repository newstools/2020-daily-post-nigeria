BBNaija lockdown evicted housemate, Lucy, has issued a note of warning to people who slide into her direct message box to school her on how to live and behave. Lucy in a tweet via her Twitter account on Tuesday warned such people to stay off her dm if the message they send would not be business-related. “Please if you slide into my dm, let it be about business, thank you. “I appreciate all the advice and opinions on how I should live, behave, and whatnot, but I am too certain you won’t keep the same energy if I came to you to do the same, so stop it. “Business email is in d bio.” she tweeted. Recall that Lucy was evicted during the Sunday live eviction show after she was nominated for possible eviction together with Kiddwaya, Vee, Trikytee, Laycon and Nengi. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-842089 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_4580-1024x454.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="328" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_4580-1024x454.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_4580-300x133.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_4580.jpg 1227w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

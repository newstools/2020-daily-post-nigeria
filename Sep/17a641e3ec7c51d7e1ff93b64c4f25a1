Gareth Bale has agreed personal terms with Tottenham Hotspur on a year-long deal. According to SportsMail, it is believed to be worth more than £13million, but it will be partly financed by Real Madrid. There are no signs yet as to when Tottenham will make an official announcement, but it will happen once a few minor contractual issues are signed. Bale returns to North London, seven years after he was sold to Madrid for a then world record fee of £90m. Spurs manager, Jose Mourinho, felt it was absolutely imperative to bring back the 31-year-old, following his side’s dismal 1-0 defeat by Everton last Sunday. Mourinho was adamant that Tottenham needed Bale’s drive and dynamism to enliven Tottenham’s attack and negotiations accelerated following discussion with Chairman Daniel Levy. It is understood no players will go in the opposite direction.

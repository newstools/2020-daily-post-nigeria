Following the recent increment in electricity tariff and the price of Premium Motor Spirit, PMS, commonly known as petrol, the Bishop of the Diocese of Akure, Rt. Rev. Simeon Borokini has berated the federal government over the development. According to the Anglican Bishop who described the hike as callous, he stated that the people are still grappling with impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which he said affected the businesses and finances of citizens. Bishop Borokini spoke over the weekend during this year’s Synod held at St Stephen’s Church, Akure, Ondo State capital. According to the Bishop who spoke on the theme, ‘Desiring the Word of God, “Many advanced countries were making life easier for their citizens through tax cuts and palliatives, the Nigerian government was doing the exact opposite. There was increase in electricity and fuel which are on called for at this time.” While urging President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately freeze the accounts of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) as well as the total overhauling of the commission and the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs over corruption scandals, the Church expressed concern over the spate of insecurity in the country. Speaking on the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA), Bishop Borokini said, “we discovered that in some churches, the pastors are the alpha and omega. They don’t have age of retirement. If they retire, they will pass the baton either to their wife or their son and which doesn’t show for accountability. Even members don’t have much to say about how the finances of the church is being spent. They are the controller of everything. So, people have started raising questions on this.” Meanwhile, with about two weeks to the governorship election in Ondo State, the Church appealed to security agencies to be proactive as the poll draws near.

Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has sent a message to new manager, Ronald Koeman, after confirming he will remain at the club. Messi has stayed away from training ever since Koeman replace Quique Setien, after informing the club he wanted to leave the club this summer. However, the 33-year-old has now made it clear that he is now ready to help Barca achieve glory. “I will continue at Barça and my attitude will not change no matter how much I have wanted to go,” he told Goal. “I will do my best. I always want to win, I’m competitive and I don’t like to lose anything. I always want the best for the club, for the dressing room and for myself. “There is a new coach and a new idea. That’s good, but then we have to see how the team responds and whether or not it will give us to compete.” In the last days, Messi was heavily linked with a move to the Premier League, to be reunited with Pep Guardiola at Manchester City.

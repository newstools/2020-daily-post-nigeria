The 31-year-old also singled out Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford for praise, According to him, the England stars added speed in Man United’s attack line against Luton. Man United defeated Luton, thanks to three goals from Juan Mata, Marcus Rashford and Mason Greenwood. “He’s a good goalkeeper, and he made that save and gave us the confidence to keep pushing, “Ighalo told Man United’s official website on Wednesday. “Like the gaffer said, we have to score more goals to finish the game, because 1-0 is never a [guaranteed] win. So that’s why we were pushing to get more goals. “You see when Mason [Greenwood] came in, and [Marcus] Rashford, you see that we had more speed up there because they were a bit tired back there. So the goals came in. We are very happy we are through to the next round.”

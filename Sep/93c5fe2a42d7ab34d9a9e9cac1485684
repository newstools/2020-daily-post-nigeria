Two accountants: Kayode Akinlade and Omotayo Salami, who allegedly stole N12.1 million from their employer, appeared before a Chief Magistrates’ Court in Ikeja on Tuesday. Akinlade, 53, and Salami,34, residents of Oko-Oba area of Lagos State, are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Prosecutor, ASP Kehinde Ajayi, told the court that the defendants committed the offences between Sept. 1, 2019 and March 31, 2020 at Ebenezer Montessori School, Labak Estate, Oko- Oba.

The Chief Magistrate, Mrs A.O. Ajibade, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N2 million each with two sureties each in like sum. Ajibade said one of the sureties must own a landed property within the court’s jurisdiction. She then adjourned the case until Oct. 29 for mention.

One Yakubu Mekodo a 60-year-old cashier has been sentenced to 15 years in prison by an Upper Area Court sitting in Kasuwan Nama in Jos on Monday, for embezzling N9.1 million. The prosecution counsel, Insp. Monday Dabit told the court that the case was reported at the Nigeria Police Area Command office in Jos on Jan. 6, 2015 by Mr. Azuatalam Osigwe of Vital Foam Jos, the complainant. Dabit said that the convict in a confessional statement said he used part of the money to buy two cars and other personal things. He further stated that the offense contravened the provisions of sections 322 and 309 of the Penal Code law. However, the Judge, Lawal Suleiman, while delivering his judgment sentenced Mekodo, following his guilty plea to the embezzlement charge. He also ordered the accused to pay N8.5 million as compensation or spend 15 years in prison. The judge said the punishment would serve as a deterrent to others, NAN reports.

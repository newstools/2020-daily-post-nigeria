The candidate of the Zenith Labour Party, ZLP, for the Ondo State governorship election, Agboola Ajayi, has vowed to defeat the incumbent, Rotimi Akeredolu and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Eyitayo Jegede. Ajayi, who is the Deputy Governor State gave reasons he will emerge victorious in the October 10 governorship election. According to him, his former party, the APC and the governor had failed the people. He accused the ruling party and the Governor of lacklustre performance, adding that the “PDP had no structure to win election in Ondo State.” He stated this when he received former PDP members in Okitipupa Local Government, led by a former governorship aspirant, Mr. Banji Okunomo and an ex-chairman of the local government, Mr. Solomon Bitire, on Wednesday. The Deputy Governor accused the PDP, a party he joined and was defeated at the primaries of having “breached the zoning arrangement and would, therefore, be punished by voters.” According to Ajayi, who dumped the APC following a long battle with the Governor, the “achievements of Akeredolu in the last three and a half years fell short of people’s expectations.” The Deputy Governor said the people of Ondo State would punish the incumbent Governor with their votes.

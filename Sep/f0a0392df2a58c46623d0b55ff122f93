As the governorship election in Ondo State draws closer, war of words continues as the Governor of the state has taken a swipe at his predecessor, Olusegun Mimiko and his Deputy Governor, Ajayi Agboola. Akeredolu who is running against Agboola who is the candidate of Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) for the October gubernatorial election spoke on Arise TV. He described both his estranged deputy and his predecessor as having traits of betrayer. He also declared that Mimiko is dead politically in the state. He noted that an alignment between Mimimko and Agboola does not affect him. “Does it affect me, does it make me nervous? The answer is no. I am confident of my victory. Who are these people? They were never my allies. “I ran against him (Mimiko) in 2012. I ran against Jegede in 2016 with Mimiko supporting him. I have treated him fairly. Mimiko has his own trait, if Agboola with all he did finds solace in Mimiko, it is because they have the same trait, they are people prone to betrayer. “Mimiko is not a political force anywhere, he left governor’s office, and tried the senate, he did not win. He did not even win his local government, he is a spent force. “He is dead politically, he is probably looking for someone to resurrect him, and maybe Agboola has some money to spend on him. I know agbola has some money to waste. Mimiko is a nobody anymore. You guys are the ones keeping them alive.” He also accused Agboola and his wife of taking contracts from the state.

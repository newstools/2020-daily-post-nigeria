The management team of Disqualified Big Brother Naija housemate, Erica, has called out Chidi Mike, a car dealer for not fulfilling the promise he made to her. DAILY POST had reported that Erica was disqualified from the show after she got a strike from Biggie for violating the house rules. Following her disqualification, she was promised a car and two million Naira by an Instagram car dealer who was also her fan. However, her management team in an Instagram video released by Mike Premium on Wednesday called out the car dealer, stating that he has failed to fulfill the promise he made to the disqualified housemate. They also accused him of misleading the general public with such failed promises. “Hi guys, this is Mike Premium, Erica’s management. “Some guys have been sending me messages asking if Erica has received the 2 million Naira and the car that was promised to her from CMC. “ I just want to quickly clear you guys that he has not sent anything and in fact, he is changing everything. “She did not receive anything from him, in fact, he changed everything. “Now he is saying that he is only going to give her 500k then the car will come in next year and that he will balance her the remaining 1.5million Naira later. “This wasn’t the initial statement, and she didn’t receive anything. “So, with this being said, we would like it if he kindly deletes the post where he made the promise from his Instagram page and stop misleading the general public,” he said.

Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has made the decision to let Emiliano Martinez leave, with the goalkeeper having already agreed personal terms with Aston Villa, according to the UK Independent. Martinez came into the Gunners’ starting XI last season, after injury ended Bernd Leno’s campaign early. The Argentine proved his worth with a string of impressive displays for Mikel Arteta’s side, but has openly admitted he would only stay if he is installed as first choice. The 28-year-old has been given no such promises over his role and after rejecting a new contract offer recently, the club have decided to move him on. Villa are expected to come in with a new bid, improving on their previous £15 million offer, with the Gunners valuing the stopper at £20m. Martinez has reportedly agreed personal terms with the Midlands club on a four-year deal and will earn around £60,000 a week. Leno is also set to reassume the No.1 role this Saturday for Arsenal’s Premier League opener away at Fulham.

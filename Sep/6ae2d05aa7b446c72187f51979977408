Arsenal’s latest signing, Gabriel Magalhaes, will wear the number 6 shirt at the club. This was confirmed on the Gunners’ official website on Tuesday after his unveiling. “Central defender Gabriel has joined us from French side Lille on a long-term contract. The 22-year-old Brazilian has completed his move and will wear our number 6 shirt,” part of the statement read. Magalhaes completed his medicals last week and has signed a five-year deal with Arsenal. He is expected to line up alongside William Saliba in Mikel Arteta’s first full season in charge. Both Saliba and Magalhaes were among the top young defenders in Ligue 1 last season. But Saliba benefitted from getting to Arsenal first and took the No.4 shirt. The No.6 shirt has been unused at Arsenal since Laurent Koscielny left.

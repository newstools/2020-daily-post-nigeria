Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has said that his first thought was that Andreas Christensen would be sent off for a last-man foul on Sadio Mane. Christensen was dismissed shortly before half time, after he hauled down Mane, who was clean through on goal. Referee Paul Tierney had initially awarded a yellow card, but reversed his decision after looking at the pitch-side VAR monitor. “I saw the sending off only in the situation. I saw Christensen’s arms around Sadio so I thought in the moment it is a sending off. But I couldn’t see it back since then so if you have seen it differently, then I respect that,” Klopp told Sky Sports after the game. When asked if the champions would have won if the game ended 11 vs 11, he replied: “Would we have won it [if Chelsea had XI]? Who knows that! I thought we were good in the first half so I thought we could win it but if we would, I don’t know.”

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that Willy Caballero will start their Carabao Cup fixture in midweek against Barnsley. Lampard was speaking after a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. He defended Kepa Arrizabalaga, whose error gifted Sadio Mane the second goal of the encounter. However, he confirmed Kepa who cost the Blues £72m, would return to the bench. “I can say now that Willy Caballero will play and that was always my feeling that he will play in that game even before today,” Lampard told reporters. Kepa is set to face more competition for his place, after Chelsea agreed a fee of around £22m with Rennes for goalkeeper Edouard Mendy.

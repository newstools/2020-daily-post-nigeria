The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, on Sunday, moved into Ile Mole, Iremo Quarters, Ile-Ife. He will be secluded there for seven days as the ancient Olojo Festival kicks off. The traditional ruler will be incommunicado and will not grant audience to anyone. NAN reports that Ogunwusi left the palace in a white attire laced with colourful ancient beads. The monarch disclosed that he will use the period to contact God for a total eradication of coronavirus and Nigeria’s peace. “I am going into seclusion; I am going into fasting and prayer in the ways of our ancestors. We are gradually winning the war against coronavirus and we must indeed be thankful because we are not superior to those countries being crippled by this pandemic. “After the seven-day seclusion, there follows the climax of it, which is the procession of the sacred Aare crown with which, we will pray for the entire nation and humanity”, the Ojaja II said.

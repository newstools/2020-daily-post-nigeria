Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, has warned that the controversial National Water Resource Bill will break up Nigeria and usher in Biafra and Oduduwa Republics. The organisation said this in a statement signed by its President-General and Secretary General Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro and Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, respectively. National Water Resource Bill 2020 seeks to bring all Water Resources, Surfaces, underground, basins, riverbanks, wherever they exist and adjoining lands, under the control of the Federal Government. The Igbo youth group called for caution, insisting that the Federal Government might be undermining the rights of Nigerians in coastal regions and by so doing giving them credence to support the realisations of Biafra and Oduduwa Republics. “The timing of the National Water Resource bill 2020 is wrong and will fuel arms struggle and ethnic agitations, especially in Coastal regions,” OYC said. “This controversial bill is viewed as obnoxious, draconian and anti-people, and capable of making Niger Delta Militants see enough reasons to join Biafra agitators and pick up arms against President Muhammadu Buhari government. “Nigeria will be doomed if the National Assembly passes the bill into law, as Federal Government cannot withstand the consequences it will bring. There’ll be civil unrest capable of breaking up the unity of Nigeria. “The bill failed before the 8th Assembly and is definitely dead on arrival before 9th Assembly because water is local,” OYC said.

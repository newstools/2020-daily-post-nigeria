Thunder on Saturday evening reportedly struck dead 15 cows at the outskirt of Ikogosi Ekiti community, Ekiti West Local Government area of Ekiti State. The incident, according to Asaoye of Ikogosi, Chief Ayo Ademilua, was a natural occurrence, which he said was strange in the town. Speaking with journalists via telephone on Sunday, Ademilua revealed that the incident happened at the Ikogosi Warm Spring site along Ipole -Ekiti road. Ikogosi warm spring has been a notable recreational and tourist centre, where warm and cold spring converge. The chief said the thunder was said to have struck during a torrential downpour that started around 4:00pm and ended at 6:02pm. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-841543" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200920-WA0024.jpg" alt="" width="1032" height="774" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200920-WA0024.jpg 1032w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200920-WA0024-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200920-WA0024-1024x768.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1032px) 100vw, 1032px"> “The whole town shook when the thunder struck. Later, some commuters coming into town and those returning home from their farmlands saw the Fulani herders who disclosed that it was thunder that killed the cattle.” Also speaking on the novel incident, the Onikogosi of Ikogosi Ekiti, Oba Abiodun Olorunnisola , alleged that the herders have been making spirited efforts to sell the cows to residents, describing this as dangerous to the health of his people. The monarch said he has reached out to his colleague at Ipole Ekiti, Oba Oladele Babatola, on the need to warn their subjects against consuming such desecrated meat. “The two of us have alerted our subjects that there was an attempt to commence the sale of the cows and we are making concerted efforts to prevent intending buyers.” The monarch, however, called on the government to evacuate the carcasses of the cows to prevent the spread of communicable diseases in the two towns. The Police Public Relations Officer, Ekiti Command, Mr. Sunday Abutu, said the incident has not been reported to the police, because it was a natural occurrence. “We have not been told, but if the owner of the cattle later realises that someone was responsible, he will report at the police station and we will surely rise to the occasion, if such happens.”

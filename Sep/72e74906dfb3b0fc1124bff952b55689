Ozo, Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, has given reasons for his recent attitude towards Nengi, his love interest. Ozo had, after last Sunday night’s eviction show, changed his attitude towards Nengi and started snubbing the Bayelsa-born housemate. He had told Vee that he was angry with Nengi because she never congratulated him for surviving the eviction and vowed never to tolerate being taken for granted by anyone. “I am so pissed at Nengi. “I had my bath, talked with Dorathy for a while, Nengi came in and saw us talking and she dropped the pictures of me that I gave to her on my bed and didn’t speak to me again,” he had told Vee. But when he was confronted by Nengi on the matter, Ozo said, “You know I was really close to leaving the house yesterday. It was about the eviction tension. You know I had just escaped.” Ozo is among the housemates that are up for possible eviction come next Sunday. Nengi on her part has secured a place in the grand finale after emerging the Ultimate Head of House on Monday.

The German government says a vaccine for coronavirus would not be available globally before the middle of 2021. Research Minister Anja Karliczek said this in Berlin on Tuesday. He stated that it was important to ensure that a vaccine is effective and safe. “We will not deviate from this line in Germany and Europe,” Dpa quoted the official as saying. Health Minister Jens Spahn affirmed that all vaccine trials would be conducted up to phase 3. The treatment would be voluntarily tested on thousands of volunteers. Germany has launched a €750 million fund to support vaccine developers. In 9 months, coronavirus has infected 29.5 million people and killed more than 930,000

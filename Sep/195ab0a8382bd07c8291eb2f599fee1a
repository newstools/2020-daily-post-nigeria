Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has said Gareth Bale has flown to London to complete his return to Tottenham. However, speaking on Saturday morning ahead of their first LaLiga fixture against Real Sociedad, Zidane insisted the transfer is “still not closed”. Bale arrived at Spurs’ training ground yesterday and is expected to tie up a one-year loan with the club. “There are negotiations. He’s there in London. I’m not going to pit us against each other. I’ve not had any problems with Gareth, I know what he has done for this club. “The situation is not firm, it’s not done, I can’t say more. “We’ve not had any problems and what he’s done here, no-one can argue with. If he moves, I wish him the best,” Zidane said.

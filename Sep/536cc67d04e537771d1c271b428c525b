Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya, has asked his lover, Erica, to stop being emotional and focus on winning the N85m grand prize. Kiddwaya said this to Erica after she came to him lamenting about housemates pairing up and some ganging up against her. The billionaire son advised Erica to stop being emotional about things happening in the house, adding that she is not here to make friends but win. Kiddwaya said: “Put emotions aside and focus on winning. You don’t need any company here. “You can’t trust anyone here. Put your mind on what you came here for.” So far, there are eleven housemates remaining in the house to battle for the grand prize of N85m in the next three weeks.

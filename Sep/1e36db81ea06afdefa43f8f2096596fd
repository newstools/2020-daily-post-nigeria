Gareth Bale has sent a warning message to Arsenal following his move back to Tottenham. Bale completed a stunning move back to north London on a one-year loan deal from Real Madrid. The 31-year-old is eager to regain his fitness and start playing. But he already has an eye on the North London Derby, a fixture he shone in during his first stint with Spurs. “It’s always good to score in the North London Derby,” Bale told Spurs TV. “And it’s always better to be on the winning side. “But yeah, I think they’re special games. It’s the main derby here for us. It’s always great to get one over the enemy.”

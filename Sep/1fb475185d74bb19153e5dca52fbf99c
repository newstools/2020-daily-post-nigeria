Ozo, evicted Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, has reacted to a statement by Kiddwaya that he aspires to be like him. DAILY POST recalls that Kiddwaya during his media tour, said he is the man Ozo wants to be.“ Kiddwaya said he was having a conversation with Ozo about his relationship with Nengi and I think “he was looking at the man he wants to be. No disrespect to him.” However, Ozo during his interview with BeatFm on Wednesday cleared Kiddwaya. When asked if he wants to be like Kiddwaya, Ozo
said the only person he would like to be is his father. He said, “If you watched the show you would know that the only person I want to be like is my father not Kiddwaya.” Ozo was the 15th housemate to be evicted from the BBNaija season 5 ‘Lockdown’ edition.

The United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has accused Russia of attempting to discredit mail-in voting. A notice by the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis on Thursday said the plan was to dissuade Americans from participating in the presidential election. The vote by mail to check the spread of COVID-19 has been endorsed by many states. President Donald Trump has been vocal against the option. On July 30, he tweeted that with mail-in voting, “2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history.” DHS says Russian “state media outlets and proxy websites published criticism of widespread mail-in voting” in mid-August. The publications allegedly claimed that unqualified voters could receive ballots due to outdated registers. “A vast amount of ballots unaccounted for and vulnerable to tampering”, DHS quoted one, warning that Kremlin-backed groups were using fake accounts and websites to confuse voters. The U.S. National Counterintelligence and Security Centre had on August 7 indicted China, Russia and Iran for alleged interference ahead of the November election. Russia was accused of working in favour of Trump, while China was fingered as a Joe Biden supporter. This week, Facebook and Twitter announced a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) warning against a Russian disinformation campaign in the U.S. The country has denied all allegations.

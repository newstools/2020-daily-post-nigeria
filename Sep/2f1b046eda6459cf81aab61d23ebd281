Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has insisted Gareth Bale is still one of the best players in the world. Bale is set to return to Tottenham Hotspur from Real Madrid in a one-year loan deal. The 31-year-old arrived in London on Friday, along with Madrid teammate Sergio Reguilon, with both players ready to put pen to paper on deals with Spurs. Bale returns to the club after seven years, while Reguilon joins on a permanent deal. Arteta is in no doubt about the Welshman’s quality and believes he will enhance the competitiveness of the Premier League. “The Premier League in its history has always had the best players in the world. “I think Gareth has been one of the most significant names that left the Premier League years ago to go to Spain. “So I think it’s positive to bring really important players back to the league and it will be a challenge because we know at his best what he can do,” Arteta told a press conference on Friday.

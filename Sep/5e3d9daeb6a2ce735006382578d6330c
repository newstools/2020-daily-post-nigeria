A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) faction, loyal to Senator Biodun Olujimi has affirmed its adoption of Oyo Governor, Seyi Makinde, as the party’s Southwest zonal leader. The faction made the declaration in Omuo-Ekiti in Ekiti-East Local Government Area on Thursday. PDP factional chairman, Kehinde Odebunmi, was among the dignitaries at the event. The members condemned former Ekiti Governor, Ayo Fayose, for warning Makinde against visiting the State. Olujimi, who presented working tools to some constituents, explained why Makinde was adopted. The lawmaker representing Ekiti South Senatorial District, said: “I thank all of you for adopting Governor Seyi Makinde as the leader of the party in the southwest. That was what we did when Governor Ayodele Fayose was the sole governor in the zone. “Former Governor Fayose is a leader of the PDP and one of the many of the PDP leaders that we have in the southwest. He is not the only leader and former governors, there were many. “Governor Makinde was adopted, because he is a decent, understanding and knowledgeable person. The southwest NASS caucus had adopted him. I heard Fayose said the caretaker in the zone has not been allowed to function, why should he say that? Because he had strangulated the caretaker committee in Ekiti. “What has Makinde done? He said we should wait and resolve this crisis before conducting the congresses, because no individual can run Ekiti and deliver. Governor Seyi Makinde is welcome in Ekiti anytime. He should even come now, so that we can celebrate him. Fayose’s comment was just an empty threat. “We say unequivocally that Governor Seyi Makinde is the leader of the zone. Why should party allow Fayose to conduct the congresses without following due process? We will resist a man who contributed to the failure of our party in Ekiti and the zone. We are resolute to rescue the party.”

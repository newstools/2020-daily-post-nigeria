Africa’s richest man, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, has declared support for Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala ahead of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) election. The third phase of the selection process for the next Director-General will begin September 7. With less than a week to commencement, the Dangote Group Chairman canvassed votes for Nigeria’s former Finance Minister. The business mogul declared his position via Twitter on Tuesday. “In these challenging times @WTO needs the renowned skills and tested experience of Dr. Ngozi Okonjo Iweala @NOIweala to lead the organisation through identified obstacles and strengthen its position as the prime facilitator of international trade. “A vote for her by all is a step in the right direction. I fully endorse the candidature of @NOIweala to lead @WTO”, he tweeted. Also from Africa are Abdel-Hamid Mamdouh (Egypt) and Amina Mohamed (Kenya). Other candidates are Mohammad Maziad Al-Tuwaijri (Saudi Arabia), Liam Fox (United Kingdom), Jesús Seade Kuri (Mexico), Tudor Ulianovschi (Moldova) and Yoo Myung-hee (Republic of Korea). In July, Okonjo-Iweala made presentation to the WTO General Council. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-835973" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200901_183856.jpg" alt="" width="1079" height="833" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200901_183856.jpg 1079w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200901_183856-300x232.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200901_183856-1024x791.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1079px) 100vw, 1079px">

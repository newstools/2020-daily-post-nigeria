The board of the Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, has granted approval for the dismissal of 8 erring officers of the Corps in accordance with the provisions of its regulation on discipline. The Corps Public Education Officer (CPEO), ACM Bisi Kazeem, disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen on Friday in Abuja. Kazeem said that the dismissal was part of the efforts made to rid the FRSC of undisciplined and corrupt elements. He also explained that the officers had been found culpable of offences ranging from desertion, forgery, number plate racketeering, bribery, scandalous behaviour, drivers’ license racketeering and patrol misconduct among others. According to him, 10 appointments were also terminated with five reductions in ranks and five loss of seniority. “Since the inception of the leadership of Dr Boboye Oyeyemi as the Corps Marshal, FRSC has entrenched discipline among its personnel and continually clamp down on corrupt elements. “While a reasonable number of staff have received different punishments for misconducts, many others have equally been commended and appreciated for disciplined and exemplary conducts,” he said. He also said that the disciplinary actions were to serve as a warning to others who might form the habit of going against regulations and tarnishing the good image of the corps.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), on Thursday, warned staff members against any form of violence during the Ondo State governorship election. Mrs. Feyi Saseyi, Acting Director, INEC headquarters, Abuja, appealed to staff members to resolve all conflicts that may arise in the field before it escalates to crisis at the polling units. Saseyi said this during a capacity building programme for heads of department, units and electoral officers held on Wednesday in Akure. Saseyi explained that conflict may arise during the electoral process but added that INEC is ready to conduct a fair and conflict-free election in the state, NAN reports. “It has become imperative for all INEC staff, especially those at the field during elections, to intervene when there is a dispute on the spot. “Dispute may arise in many forms, staff should be equipped to intervene quickly so that disputes can be resolved before it degenerates into a crisis,” Saseyi added. Ondo governorship election is expected to take place October 10th, 2020.

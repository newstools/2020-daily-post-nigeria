A former Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs in Zamfara, Bello Dankande, has emerged the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for Bakura constituency by-election. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has fixed October 31 for the poll. The seat was declared vacant after the death of Tukur Jekada. Saidu Danbala and Lawal Birnintudu withdrew from the contest. APC Primary Election Committee, Umar Lawan, announced the outcome on Thursday in Gusau. “Four candidates indicated their interest to contest in the primaries but one candidate had been disqualified by the screening committee at National Headquarters”, he said. “In line with the constitutional provision of our great party, primaries are done in three ways – direct, indirect, or consensus. We gave the candidates time to dialogue and possibly come up with one candidate,” he added. The chairman commended Danbala and Birnintudu for stepping down, saying their sacrifice would ensure unity and success of the party. Lawan warned against political thuggery and urged all stakeholders in Zamfara to remain law abiding.

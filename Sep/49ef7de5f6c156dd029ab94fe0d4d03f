The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Edo State chapter, on Wednesday, announced that fasting and prayers will be held on Sept. 16, for the conduct of a peaceful election in the state. The Chairman of the association, Bishop Oyonnude Kure, who tagged the event, “The Unbeatable God”, said this while briefing newsmen in Benin ahead of the governorship election slated for Sept. 19. Kure said there was the need for the heads of blocs and God fearing people in the state to come together in one voice to seek the face of God to avoid bloodshed and violence. He added that seeking God’s grace before, during and after the election needs to be emphasised because a peaceful election is critical to the destiny of the citizens of the state. “CAN hereby calls on all churches, all pastors, all Christians, all God-fearing and all good people of Edo for a one-day prayer and fasting for peaceful elections in Edo. “The prayer service is very crucial and critical to the destiny of the state. “We all in humility and reverence stand in prayers to call on God Almighty for divine intervention in His mercy and Almightiness for peace like a river in the state before, during and after elections,” Kure added. The leader of CAN described the Sept. 19, governorship elections as a very crucial moment in determining the destiny of the state. Bishop Kure appealed to the Christians and non-Christians in the state to foster, promote and maintain peace in the land, NAN reports.

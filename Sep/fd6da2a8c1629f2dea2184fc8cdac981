The Imo State Police Command, on Thursday, arraigned three dismissed policemen who impersonated officials of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. The dismissed cops were arrested on the order of the state Commissioner of Police for arresting and extorting suspected internet fraudsters in the name of EFCC personnel. DAILY POST learnt that apart from extorting huge sums of money from the alleged cybercrime suspects, the dismissed officers confiscated their gadgets, which included their smart phones and laptops. They were subsequently found guilty in orderly room trials and were dismissed from the force after the victims made official complaints. On Thursday, the State Police command arraigned them on criminal count charges in Owerri, the State capital. The dismissed cops were, however, returned to custody as the court did not sit.

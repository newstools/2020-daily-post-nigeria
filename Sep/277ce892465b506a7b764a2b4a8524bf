The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday said Nigerians may not survive the increment in electricity tariff and price of petrol. PDP explained that the level of poverty in Nigeria was much, hence it would be difficult for Nigerians to survive the new increment. A statement by PDP’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan wondered why President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government would increase the price of petrol and electricity tariff after admitting that over 90 million Nigerians live in poverty. Ologbondiyan said: “There is no way our countrymen and women can survive the obnoxious hike in the cost of fuel and electricity, as currently imposed by the Buhari administration, given the level of poverty the administration had already foisted on our
nation. “Indeed, we find it very inconceivable that after the Federal Government, through the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Farouq, confirmed that 90 million Nigerians are living in poverty, it still went ahead to increase the cost of essential commodities that drive our economy. “Nigerians are already in trepidation that the excruciating price increase is a sudden death sentence on many citizens, particularly those living below the poverty line, as they cannot survive under a worsened economic situation.”

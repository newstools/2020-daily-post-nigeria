Arsenal are keen on signing Jorginho from London rivals Chelsea, according to Sky Sports. Jorginho is one of the midfielders the Gunners are keen on, with Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey and Lyon’s Houssem Aouar also on their radar. Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, was Pep Guardiola’s assistant when Manchester City came close to signing Jorginho from Napoli in 2018. However, the Italian international appears to be part of Frank Lampard’s plans at Chelsea and captained the side in both of their Premier League games so far this season. While Arteta continues to search for a new midfielder, it looks as though they will be without Lucas Torreira for the 2020/2021 season as he nears a move to Atletico. The LaLiga side is keen to take the Uruguay international on loan and retain the option to sign him on a permanent deal at the end of the season.

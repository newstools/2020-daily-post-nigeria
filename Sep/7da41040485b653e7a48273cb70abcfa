The difference between the rich and the poor is just access to information and exposure. This information and exposure with regards to how to buy a car through our platform  in Nigeria is what we are going to be discussing now. It is the car dealers in Nigeria that make buying cars too difficult for the masses because of the cost of shipping and clearing of the vehicles. A smart man will buy through a licensed auctioneer because car auction prices are always cheaper and you can expect to have your car processed and delivered within 6 weeks. Let us take Toyota Corolla as a case study. In Nigeria the best price for the so-called clean Toyota Corolla 2007 is 2.3 million (check jiji.ng). Now, do you know that you can buy the same car via auto auction for less than $2000 (N900,000). Afterwards, you will ship through the best shipping company (Grimardli or Sallum Shipping line) for less than $1000(N450,000).Trucking from the auction location to the shipping company will cost less than N144,000(DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION) and the clearing cost for this car is N480,000(DEPENDING ON THE YEAR OF THE CAR). If you calculate this cost from A –Z it is less than N2,000,000 and this means that a dealer is single handedly making a profit of over N300,000 on a particular vehicle. Do you also know that most of those cars advertising on some of those local websites are upgraded cars? Do you know that they can remove the body of TOYOTA CAMRY 2008(MUSCLE)or Honda Accord 2008(EVIL SPIRIT) and replace it with 2012 parts to make it look like it is EXACT  2012 model? . It is obvious that car auction prices pay. The good news is that auction cars are durable because you will know the secret of the car you are buying and thus, you don’t end up buying flood or bad damaged vehicles all because you want to see the car you are buying on the car lot in Nigeria. Why not wait 6 weeks and get a car that will give you absolute rest of mind for the next 4 years and even longer? <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-844282" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Awwf-1.jpeg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Awwf-1.jpeg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Awwf-1-300x169.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"> Below are the reasons why you should buy a car through our platform.

Former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has revealed what led to the hike in electricity and fuel price. Recall that power distribution companies implemented new electricity tariffs on September 1, while the federal government announced a new ex-depot price of petrol on September 2. However, Omokri in a tweet via his Twitter account on Sunday, claimed that President Muhammadu Buhari was initially afraid to raise the prices of fuel and electricity. According to him, the President went ahead with the decision after he observed that the Big Brother Naija show had completely distracted Nigerian Youths. “l was stunned to see youths organise a fundraiser for a disqualified BBNaija housemate. “I was told that General MBuhari was afraid to raise the prices of fuel and electricity. “What emboldened him was when he saw how BBN has completely distracted Nigeria’s youth,” he said

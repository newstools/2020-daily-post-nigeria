The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, is in line to win a re-election. Obaseki, who contested Saturday’s governorship election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is in an early lead as results continue to trickle into the night. To retain his seat, he is in a tussle against Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who is backed by his former mentor and former governor of the State, Adams Oshiomhole. Although Oshiomhole and Ize-Iyamu have pulled their weight in certain polling units (PU) and local government areas, Obaseki has generally garnered more votes, even winning in the PU of former APC chairman, John Odigie-Oyegun. As of 5am on Sunday morning, results of ten LGAs have been declared, with eight left. The numbers officially declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), shows that PDP is leading APC with 57,075 votes. Obaseki has already been congratulated by a former Senator, Ben Bruce, who has predicted victory. In a tweet, Bruce hailed the Governor on what he described as an “anticipated victory”. It has been a bitter fight to remain in office for Obaseki. He tried to win re-election on the platform of the APC, but ran into troubled waters with Oshiomhole, who himself was removed as the National Chairman of the ruling party. Obaseki swiftly switched to PDP, where he easily won the party’s ticket. He now looks set to continue as Edo State Governor for another four years.

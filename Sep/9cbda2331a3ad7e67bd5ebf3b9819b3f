Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has warned Nicolas Pepe to “raise his levels” after he was left on the bench, in the Premier League opener against Fulham on Saturday. Pepe, who completed a club-record £72m move to the Emirates last, while Willian arrived as a free agent his summer. However, the Ivory Coast international was benched at Craven Cottage, with Arteta instead opting to give Willian his debut. Pepe replaced Willian with 15 minutes left, but by that time the former Chelsea man had put in an impressive display and was involved in all three goals. When asked about Pepe’s omission, Arteta told reporters: “Well, it’s not [just] for Nico, I think it’s for the players that were on the bench and as well the ones that we had to leave at home. “If they raise their levels then the performances of the team and club are going to improve and this is what I demand from them.”

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has singled out striker, Timo Werner for praise following his impressive display in the Blues’ 3-1 victory against Brighton on Monday night. Chelsea defeated Brighton, thanks to three goals from Jorginho, Reece James and Kurt Zouma. Leandro Trossard did score for Brighton at the Amex Stadium. But Lampard said Werner, who sealed a move to Stamford Bridge earlier this summer from RB Leipzig, was a ‘real threat’ against Brighton on his Premier League debut for Chelsea. Speaking on the performances of Werner after the game, Lampard was quoted by Football London as saying at his post-match press conference: “I know qualities he’s going to bring to the team. A real threat. “Timo has a dead leg. A bit of time for him to be back.” Lampard added: “We will be better. We have had the players together for four days. We showed good stuff, but we will improve. It’s about getting a win, and we did a lot of good to get that.”

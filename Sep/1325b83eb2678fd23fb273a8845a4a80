The Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme, Prof Mohammed Nasir Sambo, has disclosed that the institution has requested for funds to procure COVID-19 protective equipment for some security operatives. Sambo said those involved include men of the Nigeria Police Force, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. He said the request for the fund was made because the listed security agents stand a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. The NHIS boss stressed that no effort must be spared in ensuring their protection in the line of duty. He disclosed this while handing over a consignment of Personal Protection Equipment to the acting Chairman of EFCC, Umar Abba Mohammed at the Headquarter Complex of the anti-graft agency, in Abuja. According to Sambo, the risk was responsible for “the prompt response of the NHIS to requests from the PTF on COVID-19 for assistance in the provision of personal protection equipment for officers of strategic agencies such as the Police, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the EFCC”. The NHIS boss said the Scheme had also recently extended a similar gesture to personnel of healthcare providers through the government of some states in the country with a high burden of COVID -19.

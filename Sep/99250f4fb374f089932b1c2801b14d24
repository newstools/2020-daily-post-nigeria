The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Lagos State will on Monday commence ‘Operation Show Your Driver’s Licence and Vehicle Papers’. Lagos State Sector Commander, Olusegun Ogungbemide, disclosed this in a statement on Sunday. He said the operation was to checkmate the spate of accidents, especially truck-related crashes and fatalities. The official noted that most crashes could have been prevented if drivers were careful and patient on the roads. “With the recent increase in the accidents involving articulated vehicles, there is the need for all drivers to be handy with their driver’s licence and valid vehicle papers as the command begins Operation Show Your Driver’s Licence and Vehicle Licence. “The recent upsurge in crashes involving trucks calls for concern on the level of professionalism of such drivers hence the need to check documents. The operations start immediately. All vehicles impounded will not be released until owners provide genuine documents.” Ogungbemide cautioned all road users to ensure they obtain all necessary documents that qualify them to drive. The commander warned that anyone caught without valid documents would be sanctioned according to the law.

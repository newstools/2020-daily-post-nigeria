Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has admitted Victor Moses is not part of his first-team plans for the 2020/2021 season. The former Super Eagles forward returned to Stamford Bridge this month, after his loan spell at Inter Milan. Moses is yet to make a matchday squad since the start of the campaign. His last game for the Blues was in a Europa League fixture against BATE in October 2018. Ahead of Tuesday’s Carabao Cup clash against Tottenham Hotspur, Lampard confirmed the 29-year-old is not training with the first-team. “At the moment Victor isn’t in that position with us. We have a bubble at the training ground with the first-team squad, which Victor hasn’t been part of. “I know Victor well and we will see how that develops over the next week,” Lampard said. Moses’ deal with Chelsea expires in June 2021.

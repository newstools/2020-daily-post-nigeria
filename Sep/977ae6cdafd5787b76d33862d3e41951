A public servant identified as Blessing Etim, on Thursday prayed a Customary Court in Jikwoyi, to grant her request of divorce from her husband on the grounds that he treats her like a piece of filthy rag. Etim, who resides in Nasarawa State, made the allegations in a divorce petition to the court. “I am exhausted in this marriage. Since I married my husband, I have not known peace. He is always fighting me. The worst of it all is that he harasses me before family members and in public. ”He treats me like a piece of filthy rag,” she alleged. The petitioner told the court that her husband almost strangled her on one occasion, “saying if not for my neighbours who came to my rescue, I would have been long dead”. She also alleged that her husband has stopped caring for the family, adding that she has been the one paying their house rent, clothing and the children’s school fees, NAN reports. The respondent was not in court and did not send any correspondence to state reasons for his absence. The presiding judge, Jemilu Jega, in his ruling said in view of the absence of the respondent, for the interest of Justice, hearing notice will be pasted at the respondent’s residence. Jega then adjourned the matter until Sept 15 for hearing.

President Muhammadu Buhari has signed into law the Nigeria Police Bill, 2020. His spokesman, Femi Adesina, disclosed this in a statement on Thursday. He said the president in a memo dated September 16, 2020, communicated his assent to the National Assembly through the Clerk of the legislature. The new Police Act repeals Cap. P19. Laws of the Federation, 2004, and provides for a more effective and well organized Police Force. It establishes an appropriate funding framework for the Police in line with what is obtainable in other federal government key institutions and enhances professionalism in the Force through increased training opportunities. The presidency says the new law “creates an enduring cooperation and partnership between the Police Force and communities in maintaining peace and combating crimes nationwide.”

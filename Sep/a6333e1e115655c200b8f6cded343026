Spain coach, Luis Enrique, has insisted that Barcelona would continue to win titles without their captain, Lionel Messi. Enrique, who coached Messi for three seasons between 2014 and 2017 during his time at Camp Nou, said this on Saturday at a news conference ahead of Spain’s Nations League fixture with Ukraine. DAILY POST recalls that Messi on Friday evening confirmed that he had changed his mind and will remain a Barcelona player for the 2020/2021 season. This comes after almost two weeks of intense speculation, triggered by Messi’s fax to Barcelona, asking for his contract to be terminated. “I don’t know whether to pronounce Messi, but I am going to do it. “I think the clubs are above all people, players and presidents. Barcelona, founded in 1899, is one of the best in the world. They’ve always won titles. “It’s evident that there has been a wonderful relationship. Leo [Messi] has made Barca grow exponentially, but I’d have liked it if a much more friendly agreement had been reached. “Sooner or later, Messi will stop playing at Barca. Barcelona will continue to win titles without Messi and Messi will continue to be a wonderful footballer.”

The Federal Government of Nigeria has said that successful applicants for the 774,000 jobs under the Special Public Works Programme, will be paid using their Bank Verification Numbers (BVN). This is to ensure transparency and avoid double payments. Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo (SAN), noted this while speaking at a press conference he jointly addressed along with the Director-General of the National Directorate of Employment (NDE), Nasir Ladan on Thursday. The programme which is expected to gulp N52billion, will see participants earn N20,000 per month for three months. The exercise is scheduled to commence in October. “Mr. President has given a clear directive for this programme to be totally free of fraud, so everybody will be paid by a bank account and BVN. You must not only have a bank account you must have a BVN so you cannot be paid twice. “Everybody’s biometrics will be taken by the banks to ensure that you don’t have two different accounts. Within the next few weeks we will do that,” he said.

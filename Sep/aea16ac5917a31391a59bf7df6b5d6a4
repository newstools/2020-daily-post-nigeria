One Isaac Ayodele, a former bank worker, on Thursday told a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan that his wife, Omotayo, tricked him into buying a motorcycle from her lover on hire purchase. NAN reports that Ayodele told the court that his wife was cheating on him. “I stopped my wife from working when I had a job. But unfortunately, I lost my job and allowed her to sell food and she eventually started sleeping with men. “I needed to start life all over and Omotayo introduced her lover to me as a motorcycle dealer who will allow me to pay for the bike on installments. “When she found out that she’s been exposed, she and her lover threatened my life. “She moved out of my house soon after that with my children,” he said. His wife, Omotayo in her defense argued that she filed the divorce suit, to stay alive. According to her, Ayodele is an irresponsible man who beats her up whenever she asks for financial assistance from him. “My husband is an irresponsible and wicked man who does not wish me well. “He stopped me from working and refused to provide for me and my children. “Whenever I ask him for money, he will descend heavily on me. “After he was sacked, we were ejected from our house and my brother rented an apartment for us. “I also got him a motorcycle but he ran away and did not keep to the agreement. The motorcycle dealer brought policemen to arrest me,” Omotayo said. However, Chief Ademola Odunade, in his ruling ordered the couple to produce more evidence to support their claims, advising them to maintain peace. He also adjourned the case until Oct. 13 for judgment.

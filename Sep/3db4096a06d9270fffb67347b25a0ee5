Rennes FC have reportedly informed Chelsea that it will cost more than £30 million to sign their 28-year-old goalkeeper, Edouard Mendy, this summer, The Telegraph UK reports. Rennes are holding out for a fee in the region of £30m for Mendy following his promising performances for the club last season. The French Ligue 1 club would love to receive a transfer fee of £40 million for the Senegalese international given that he is in the prime of his career. Chelsea coach, Frank Lampard, wants to sign a new goalkeeper to provide competition for current number one, Kepa Arrizabalaga following the Spaniard’s inconsistent performances last season. Lampard believes that Mendy would be able to put Kepa under pressure for a starting spot in his team in the 2020/21 Premier League season. Mendy has spent the past two seasons at Rennes, where he has established himself as their first-choice goalkeeper thanks to his excellent performances. The shot-stopper started his career at Cherbourg and Stade de Reims before he moved to Rennes in the summer of 2018.

Liverpool head coach, Jurgen Klopp, has said that the Reds defeated Arsenal 3-1 in the Premier League on Monday night because his team were dominant against the Gunners. Klopp said Liverpool played an excellent game against Arsenal and were difficult to defend. According to him, Arsenal had not too many chances against his team, adding that his goalkeeper, Allison Becker also made some good saves against the visitors. Liverpool defeated Mikel Arteta’s side at Anfield thanks to goals from Sadio Mane, Andy Robertson and Diogo Jota came. “It was a really good game, I loved pretty much each second,” Klopp said as quoted by Liverpool’s official website after the match. “I didn’t like the goal we conceded but the reaction afterwards immediately, I liked a lot. Against a top team in form playing like we did tonight is something, to be honest. “It doesn’t help us for Thursday or help us for Sunday, but for tonight it was quite good, I have to say. I really liked it: we were dominant, we played football, we were difficult to defend, the counter-press was top, the attitude was great and played some really good stuff. “Arsenal had not too many, but some, chances because they have real quality. I think most of the moments they had were offside, so good defending, but Ali made a save anyway. It was all good, a really good performance.”

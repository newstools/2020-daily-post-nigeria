Ahead of tomorrow’s visit to Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State by the Ebeano political family, a former Secretary to the Enugu State Government, Dr. Dan Shere has declared that Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi has justified the people’s confidence. He also stated that the Ebeano political group was never asleep. Shere, who is the coordinator of Ebeano, made the remark while briefing journalists in Enugu on Friday on the essence of the planned visit. DAILY POST reports that an announcement to that effect had invited all present and former political office holders, party office holders, directors, heads of parastatals both federal and state to the visit which will be held at the Enugu Government House. The founder of the Ebeano political group and former governor, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani will lead the group on the solidarity visit to Governor Ugwuanyi. While ruling out 2023 guber politics in the visit, Shere said, “The Governor, His Excellency Rt. Hon. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi is one of us; he is the present ambassador of Ebeano. “So, the Saturday event is to solidarize with him; to let him know that he has represented us well and we are well pleased with him. “It has nothing to do with 2023; we are going to the Government House to let him know that we are solidly behind him. “Everybody can attest to the fact that there is peace and security in Enugu. People go about their businesses here without fear. The urban renewal and rural development projects are also so visible for us to see.” “The only distraction is that we have had quarrel in the past, but it is natural; we have settled and decided to come under one umbrella, which is Ebeano. “Ebeano is not a political party, it cuts across the PDP, APC, and non-political actors. So, it is very much alive. Ebeano never slept,” he added.

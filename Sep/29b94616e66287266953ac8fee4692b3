Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, is very likely to be without the club’s new signings, Hakim Ziyech and Ben Chilwell for their Premier League opener against Brighton on Monday due to injuries. The Athletic reports that Ziyech and Chilwell have suffered knee and heel injuries respectively that could rule them out for the fixture. Ziyech, who joined Chelsea from Ajax earlier this summer, twisted his knee during the Blues’ recent friendly against Brighton last month, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Meanwhile, Lampard has been given a big boost with winger, Christian Pulisic, also in line to feature against Brighton at the Amex Stadium after recovering from a hamstring injury sustained in the FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal. Chelsea finished last season in the fourth position on the Premier League table behind Liverpool, Manchester City and Manchester United.

Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State and the Chairman of the PDP National Campaign Council for the Edo Governorship election has warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) against declaring Saturday’s election inconclusive. Wike, who applauded INEC and the security agencies, said he is still worried despite no report of violence so far. Governor Wike during a press briefing on Saturday evening, warning that the residents of Edo have made their decision and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop it. “We do not expect the election to be 100 % perfect and there was no report of violence so far, but I’m still worried. “INEC should move straight to the coalition Centre which is the critical aspect of this election before I can actually say INEC has done well or not. “We do not want a situation of inconclusive elections. The people have made their decision, and there is nothing anyone can do, so I will also urge the stakeholders to be vigilant and remain calm,” Wike added. Meanwhile, INEC in the early hours of Sunday, said the delay in the receipt of collated results of the governorship election from local government areas in Edo has delayed the collation at the State level.

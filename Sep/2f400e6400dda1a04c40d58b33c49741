The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has warned against perceived neglect of the non-pharmaceutical protocols and other measures aimed at tackling the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. The PTF chairman and Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Mr. Boss Mustapha, gave the warning at the daily briefing by the PTF on Monday in Abuja. He said that there was increasing disregard for basic non-pharmaceutical measures that have proven to be very successful. According to him, face masks have now been turned into chin masks, social distancing and gatherings are returning to the pre-COVID era. Mustapha, however, called for vigilance in order to forestall any danger of a second wave of the pandemic as the countries in Europe were currently facing. ”Also, our health systems, in spite of its fragility, have been able to withstand and contain cases resulting from COVID-19 infection, where those of more advanced countries have been overwhelmed. “This call is made more pertinent in view of the noticeably increasing disregard for basic non-pharmaceutical measures that have proven very successful. “Facemasks have now been turned into chin masks, social distancing and gatherings are returning to the pre-COVID era. “We cannot afford the importation of the virus. “We appeal strongly to all Nigerians to persuade their relations arriving in Nigeria to self-isolate upon arrival, as required and test on day seven as prescribed,” he added.

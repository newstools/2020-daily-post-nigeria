Chelsea have confirmed that 21-year-old midfielder, Conor Gallagher, left the club to join West Bromwich Albion on a season-long loan ahead of their Premier League clash with Liverpool on Sunday. Gallagher, who signed a new long-term Chelsea contract before leaving Stamford Bridge for West Brom, is now the second Blues midfielder to leave the West London club in less than a week. DAILY POST had reported that Chelsea midfielder, Kenedy, left the club to join Granada on a season-long loan last week. Chelsea made the announcement in a statement via the club’s official website on Thursday night. The statement read in part: “Conor Gallagher has signed a new long-term Chelsea contract and today joined West Bromwich Albion on loan for the 2020/21 season. “The five-year deal commits Gallagher to his boyhood club until at least 2025 and follows a positive first season in senior football in the Championship.”

A middle-aged woman, Alhaja Aishat Adenike Popoola on Monday dragged her husband, Alhaji Ogundoyin Popoola to a High Court of Justice sitting in Ile Ife, Osun State, over the sale of a four bedroom flat apartment. The four bedroom flat building, situated at No. 7, Awotorebo Street, Awotile Layout, in Ile Ife was bought from Mr. Oluwadamilare Kolawole by Mr. Popoola in 2008. It was however revealed that Mr. Popoola has sold the property to Mrs Adefunke Deborah Awoyele, on the 24th of July 2019. Mrs. Popoola has, however, dragged her husband to Court for selling the house which has been given to her by her husband. She claimed that her husband had on February 10, 2010 given the four bedroom flat to her with all necessary documents. Her counsel, Barrister Remi Ayoade, prayed the Court to compel her husband to reverse his action on the sale of the building. Ayoade urged the Court to compel her husband to also withdraw all the documents on the said property. Awoyeleâ€™s counsel, Barrister Ifedayo Olowoyo replied to the submission of the Plaintiff, that his client does not in any way know the plaintiff nor had any business with her. Olowoyo argued that if the plaintiff has any issues with her husband on the property which his client had legally bought with all necessary documents, she should settle it with the first defendant since they claimed to be a couple. Justice, A. A. Aderibigbe in his ruling, however adjourned the case to the 11th of November, 2020 for further hearing.

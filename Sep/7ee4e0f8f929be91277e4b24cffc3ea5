The Lagos State Ministry of Education has approved school calendar for 2020/2021 session. Olaniran Emmanuel, Head of Public Affairs, Office of Education Quality Assurance (OEQA) released the details in a statement at the weekend. Public and private schools below tertiary level will resume First Term academic activities on Monday, 21st September, 2020 while the term runs through Friday 18th December, 2020. The Second Term starts on Monday 4th January, 2020 and runs through Friday 6th April, 2021 while students will resume for Third Term on Tuesday 4th May, 2021 and close on Friday 6th August, 2021. Director-General, OEQA, Abiola Seriki-Ayeni, urged school leaders to have a qualitative health and safety plan that will help protect students, teachers and workers. She said it is not enough to reopen but to keep staying opened since some schools all over the world had to shut down after reopening due to a spike in the pandemic. “All schools must make efforts to comply with these requirements, not just for the improvement of the overall school operations but for safe reopening for academic activities to support the Lagos State Government quest for a full return.” The official advised schools to have a flexible teaching and learning plan where students and teachers who feel sick can teach or learn from home via available online platforms. Seriki-Ayeni reminded schools that they must strive to avoid COVID-19 infections. Teachers, students and visitors are expected to wear face mask at all time, observe physical distancing, wash hands at intervals and maintain high standard of personal hygiene. Lagos State government emphasized that schools must have an isolation/holding bay to care for medical emergencies should students come up with symptoms such as cough, headache, catarrh, difficulty in breathing, sneezing and fever.

The Lagos State Government has cancelled the practical assessment examination, ahead of the conduct of 2020 Basic Education Certificate Examinations (BECE) for JSS 3 students. The BECE is scheduled to hold as from Tuesday, October 6th to Monday October 12th. A statement signed by the Director, Lagos State Examinations Board, Supo Gbadegesin, explained that the assessment examination has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last week, the board announced new dates for the conduct of the 2020 screening test into Lagos State Model Colleges and Upgraded Junior Secondary Schools in the State. While the Board set from September 26th to 30th for the conduct of the Computer-Based Testing version of the screening, October 3rd was slated for the paper-pencil testing (PPT) version of the examination in all the six education districts. “For the avoidance of doubt, the Board would be unable to embark on the Practical Assessment of Candidates because of the brevity of time available to her in the conduct of the 2020 Basic Education Certificate Examination. “It is worthy to note that the Practical Assessment ought to have taken place between March and April 2020 but due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic virus, schools had to be closed down to prevent the spread of the virus. “The urgency of the schedule examination would not make the Practical Assessment feasible. “All examination papers would be administered in Objective Format for the year 2020. This is to enable the Board to adapt to the rule of not keeping students in the examination hall for a long period of time,” part of the statement read.

No fewer than 13 persons died in two separate accidents on Thursday on the Oloru-Bode Saadu road, on the outskirts of Ilorin. The Federal Road Safety Corps, FRSC, Sector Commander in Kwara, Jonathan Owoade, confirmed the incident to newsmen at the scene of the crashes in Bode Saadu, NAN reports. He said the accidents occurred as a result of the driver’s loss of concentration, over speeding, and tyre burst. “Two different road traffic crashes occurred this morning at the Jebba-Oloru axis, one was due to over speeding and boredom, it rammed into a stationary truck while the second was as a result of tyre burst,” he said. Owoade said the first accident involving a bus and a truck occurred at about 4.00am at Aiyekale community. According to him, Out of 19 passengers, 11 persons died on the spot, one died in the hospital while seven sustained different degrees of injuries. He also said that the second accident, which was as a result of tyre burst, happened at Lakanla bridge, and “ 8 persons were involved, one person died and another injured” The FRSC commander also revealed that the corpses had been deposited at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital morgue and those who sustained injuries were receiving treatment. He, however, cautioned motorists against night journeys and reckless driving in the interest of their lives and that of the passengers. “Trucks should compulsorily use reflectors when parked by roadsides or highways, overloading should be avoided, they overburden the tyres and cause them to burst” “Drivers should avoid night journeys, they have to be more careful, life has no duplicate. There is nothing bad in stopping the journey when night falls,” he added.

The Benue State Police Command has explained why the screening exercise for applicants from Ogbadibo Local Government Area in the ongoing recruitment into the force was suspended. DAILY POST had reported that some candidates from Ogbadibo, who successfully completed the police online recruitment registration and proceeded for physical screening have been left stranded after the Benue State Police Command suspended and threatened to cancel the process. The officers teargassed and chased out applicants from the venue. Most of them who came from other states such as Lagos, Abuja, Kano, Port Harcourt and a host of other states are now stranded in the state. However, when DAILY POST contacted the Benue State Police Public Relations Officer, Anene Sewuese Catherine, she said the exercise was not cancelled but suspended “for their own good.” She said, “These people decided to prove themselves. They were constituting nuisance to the environment. Because they wanted to waste our time, we asked them to go and come back on the last day. It was not cancelled because we had already screened 300 people from that local government. “They were about 1,700 and we have successfully screened 300. “The others became unruly and we had to send them away for their own good because they were going to stampede themselves. So, we asked them to go and come back. “It is a way of controlling the crowd. They broke windscreen of a police vehicle.” When asked if the police authority was aware that some of the candidates travelled from far and wide for the screening exercise, and are now stranded, the PPRO rudely responded by saying, “I am busy now with the recruitment. I think I have given you all the information you need.”

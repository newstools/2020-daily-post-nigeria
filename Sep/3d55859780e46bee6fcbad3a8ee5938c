Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Trikytee has said Kiddwaya’s eviction came as a shock to him. Speaking to Neo after the Sunday night live eviction show, Trikytee said he felt Kiddwaya will be among the housemates in the semi-final week. According to him, “If anybody told me that Kiddwaya would be out today I wouldn’t believe it. “I guess because he always spoke about being self-made.” Neo agreed with him saying Kiddwaya’s eviction came as a shock to him because his father has money. “I also did not expect his eviction because I knew they had money to vote,” Neo added. The eviction of Kiddwaya and Prince leaves seven housemates in the lockdown house to battle for the grand prize worth N85m.

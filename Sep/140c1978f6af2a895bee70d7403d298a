Parents and teachers of private schools in Kwara State, on Friday stormed the secretariat of the National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools, demanding the resumption of academic activities. The protesters carried placards with inscriptions such as, “Open our schools for students, ”children are hawking around the streets rather than schooling, ”teachers are suffering, ”out of school pupils are in football viewing centres, markets and parties.” The protesters noted that many states are resuming on September 21, 2020, lamenting with dismay that the Kwara state government is not saying anything about schools’ resumption in the state. They said, “parties are everywhere, hotels, businesses have resumed, markets are running, children are following parents to churches and mosques.” Dr Abdulrahman Adetunji, chairman of the association, who addressed the aggrieved protesters, appealed to them to be patient. He said the State Commissioner for Education, has assured the association that the state government was working on schools’ resumption in the state. Dr Adetunji said private schools were ready for resumption as necessary COVID-19 safety protocols have been put in place by all private schools, including social distancing, hand washing and provision of hand sanitizers among others.

Chelsea are out of the Carabao Cup, after losing on penalties to Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday night. Frank Lampardâ€™s men took the lead in the first half, after Timo Werner slammed in his first goal for the club. However, the Blues failed to make their dominance count and allowed Spurs back into the game. The hosts eventually levelled late in the second half, as Erik Lamela appeared unmarked at the far post to prod the ball home. Spot-kicks were taken to decide which team qualifies for the quarter-finals. Each side converted their first five kicks, but Mason Mount missed for Chelsea.

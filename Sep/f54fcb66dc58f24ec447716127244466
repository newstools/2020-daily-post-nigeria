Manchester United have began negotiations with Barcelona to secure a season-long loan deal for Ousmane Dembele, according to Record Sport. The France winger is now United’s target, after they failed to land their priority for this summer, Borussia Dortmund’s Ousmane Dembele. Dembele has struggled for form and fitness since moving to Barca in 2017, but the Red Devils have identified the 23-year-old as an possible back-up option to Sancho, with just less than two weeks remaining in the transfer window. Senior United officials, including executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, have now begun talks for the player. Barcelona are open to sanctioning a loan move for the forward, but only if an obligatory purchase option is included in their agreement. The LaLiga giants are demanding a fee of €100million (£92m) from clubs wanting to sign Dembele outright this summer. They paid a £135m transfer fee for Dembele three years ago.

The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has told President Muhammadu Buhari’s government to immediately reverse the increment in pump price of petrol. The increment was announced by Pipelines and Product Marketing Company (PPMC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, on Wednesday. The new price has since stirred reactions from Nigerians and prominent individuals on social media. SERAP, reacting on Iis official Twitter page, described the increment as a travesty, noting that the decision will affect millions of Nigerians struggling to make ends meet. SERAP wrote: “We urge Nigerian authorities to immediately reverse the unfair hike in fuel price from N148 to N151.56k per litre. “This is a travesty, as it would have a knock-on effect on millions of poor Nigerians who will struggle to meet the increased costs of transport and basic goods.”

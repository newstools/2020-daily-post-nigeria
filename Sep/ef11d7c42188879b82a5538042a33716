A former Manchester United defender, Patrice Evra, has criticised the club’s coach, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, for not starting new signing, Donny van de Beek, in the Red Devils’ Premier League 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace on Saturday. Man United began their Premier League campaign with a 3-1 home defeat at Old Trafford. Crystal Palace took the lead through Andros Townsend, before Wilfried Zaha doubled their advantage from the penalty spot. New boy Donny van de Beek pulled one back, but Zaha netted again for Roy Hodgson’s men to give the visitors all three points against Solskjaer’s men. But Evra feels Van de Beek should have started the match against Palace and that Solskjaer sometimes seems to do too much to protect his players. Discussing the error from Solskjaer, Evra said on Sky Sports’ coverage of the game: “I feel like Ole [Gunnar Solskjaer] is sometimes protecting his players too much. He thinks, ‘Van de Beek just arrived so I know everyone is excited.’ Play him! “If he plays bad, at least people will criticise Van de Beek and not Ole, but now they will ask why he did not start him. “Sometimes you should not protect your players.” Man United’s next Premier League fixture is against Brighton next weekend.

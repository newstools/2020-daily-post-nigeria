She alleged that the suspect stored the video clips for three years with the intention of destroying her daughter’s life. According to her, marriage arrangements have been concluded for her daughter, scheduled for Oct. 17, this year, when Baffa released the phonographic video of him sexually abusing the girl. She said that the ugly development made the would-be groom to withdraw from the proposed marriage. ”Exactly on June 20, 2020, I received a call from Lagos on the viral circulated video of my nude daughter being sexually abused by Baffa Hayatu Tafida. ”The suspects shared the clips to my daughter’s suitor along with other online groups,” she said.

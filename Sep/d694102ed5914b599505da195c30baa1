Real Madrid has provided the latest update on forward, Eden Hazard’s injury ahead of their La Liga clash against Valladolid on Wednesday night. Hazard is yet to feature for Real Madrid so far this season due to a muscle injury. The former Chelsea star missed Real Madrid’s 0-0 draw with Real Sociedad on September 20 and also their 3-2 victory against Real Betis last week. However, Real Madrid has now confirmed in a statement via its official website on Wednesday that Hazard’s recovery will continue to be assessed after tests were carried out on his right leg. The statement read: “After the tests carried out today on our player Eden Hazard by Real Madrid Medical Services, he has been diagnosed with a muscle injury in his right leg. Pending evolution.” The kick-off time between Real Madrid and Valladolid is 8:30 pm.

Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez, could snub a move to Juventus despite already agreeing to personal terms and joining Atletico Madrid, according to Deportes Cuatro. Suarez looks set to leave Camp Nou this summer after new boss Ronald Koeman decided he wonâ€™t be part of his plans. Juve are the clear favourites to land the 33-year-old, but now there is a new twist in the transfer saga. But Suarez wants to take his time and consider all offers, before deciding his next move. While he is open to moving to Serie A, a late approach from Atletico has created a dilemma, with the Uruguay international preferring to stay in Spain. Diego Simeone is a big fan of his fellow South American and believes he is the perfect replacement for either Diego Costa or Alvaro Morata, with Atleti looking to offload one, or even both of their misfiring forwards.

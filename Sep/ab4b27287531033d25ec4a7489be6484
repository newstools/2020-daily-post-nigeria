President Muhammadu Buhari’s Personal Assistant on Digital and New Media, Tolu Ogunlesi, has reacted to a declaration that Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, would rule Nigeria. The Chairman of Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, Lagos State chapter, Apostle Alex Bamgbola, had declared that Femi Fani-Kayode will become Nigeria’s president, someday. Bamgbola had said Fani-Kayode would rule Nigeria, if he remains humble. He made the declaration during a prayer for the former minister. The pronouncement had stirred reactions from some Nigerians on social media who accused CAN of disgracing Christianity in the country and dragging itself into partisan politics. Reacting, Ogunlesi wondered if CAN was still a Christian body. Sharing a video of the prayer session, on his verified Twitter handle, the presidential aide wrote: “Is the C in CAN still for “Christian” or have they changed it to something else” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-836684" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200903_164429_130.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="724" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200903_164429_130.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200903_164429_130-298x300.jpg 298w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200903_164429_130-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200903_164429_130-80x80.jpg 80w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

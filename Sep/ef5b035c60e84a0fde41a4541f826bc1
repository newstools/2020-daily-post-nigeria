Singer Kanye West has shared footage of himself urinating on his Grammy Award following his professed battle against labels Universal and Sony, to try and retrieve the rights to his music. Recall that the 43-year-old singer had on Tuesday called out the National Basketball Association, NBA and music industry over the enslavement of blacks. Kanye in a series of posts on his Twitter page described the NBA and music industry as modern-day slave ships. He also revealed that henceforth he would not argue with black men on labels but fight to liberate them, adding that the world needs healing. Following the development, on Wednesday the rapper in a video he posted on his Twitter account urinated on one of his 21 Grammy awards, placed inside of a toilet bowl. He wrote “Trust me, Won’t Stop.” See Video below: Trust me … I WONT STOP pic.twitter.com/RmVkqrSa4F — ye (@kanyewest) September 16, 2020

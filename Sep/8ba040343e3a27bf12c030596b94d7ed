Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has said the strategy that led to his victory at the polls was hatched in Rivers State after a marathon meeting with like minds. Governor Obaseki made the revelation when he led some political leaders of Edo State on a thank-you visit to Governor Nyesom Wike at the Rivers State Government House, Port Harcourt. He noted the commitment of Governor Wike in ensuring electoral victory for him by relocating to Edo State despite the needless attacks from the opposition. The Edo Governor also described the consolation he got from his Rivers State counterpart, as the second pivot for his electoral victory. According to him, “After I was pushed out of my former Party, this house was the first place I sought solace. You took me in as a brother, out of the storm, changed my clothes and gave me food to eat. “It was in this house the Campaign Council met to work out the key strategies that led us to victory. “You mobilised people across the country. You moved to Benin, went through the humiliation and attacks. You supported us and we won. “It will be a sin against God if we do not come to say thank you. Even if the victory we are celebrating is from God. He has used people like you to make it happen,” he said. In his response, Rivers State Governor Wike said his support was informed by the fact that Governor Obaseki was courageous and fearless. “Our work would have been difficult if he did not make himself available. I cannot support a lily hearted person. Governor Obaseki was firm. “It is not easy to fight godfatherism. But he has the interest of Edo people at heart.

Lionel Messi is still in the Barcelona players’ WhatsApp group chat, despite asking to leave the club this summer. This was revealed by his team-mate, Frenkie de Jong. De Jong says that as far as he is concerned, Messi remains a part of the group, even if he has not been a part of the start of 2020/2021 training. “I hope that Messi is still there when I get back, but that is not something that is up to me. He’s still in the group chat,” he told Fox Sports. “I’m not anyone to talk about it with him, I’m sure he has many people around him doing that these days.” De Jong joined Barcelona last summer from Ajax for a fee, making 42 total appearances for the club in all competitions. The Dutch midfielder may however not be lining up along with Messi next season, with the 33-year-old adamant on leaving the club.

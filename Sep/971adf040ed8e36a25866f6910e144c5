An eminent Abian and legal luminary, Dr. Paul Ananaba, SAN, has commended Abia State Governor, Dr. Okezie Ikpeazu for constructing Faulks Road, Aba, and bringing an end to the perennial flooding in the area. The erudite lawyer and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) was speaking in an interview with newsmen at his residence in Aba. According to him, “I am one of the direct beneficiaries of Governor Ikpeazu’s good works. Many people may say what they don’t understand. I am talking about what I know. By the time I bought this house, there was no road to come here. I thought it was a mistake but that is the Faulks Road he built and now I can drive into Faulks Road”. Dr. Ananaba stated that Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has done very well, adding that “there is no government or Governor that satisfies everyone. “He has done quite a lot. He is doing his best”, the senior lawyer added. He further said the Governor still has some time to complete a number of his projects in the State, saying that “all the Governor needs now is the support of all and encouragement, not distraction”. He stressed that “all over the world, Covid-19 has affected the economy and things are not the way they ought to be, yet, we are commissioning projects.” He informed that in spite of the challenges of the economy, the Governor has not stopped executing projects, adding that the ongoing project commissioning and inspections of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu tagged “Kinetic Abia” is an exercise to be roundly appreciated by all those who wish the State well

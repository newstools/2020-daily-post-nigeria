Luis Suarez has threatened to publish emails from Barcelona, which listed the teams he was forbidden from joining, before sealing his transfer to Atletico Madrid, Mundo Deportivo reports. The 33-year-old has signed for Barca’s LaLiga rivals on Thursday in a deal worth €6million (£5.5m). But Suarez was almost forced to take drastic action, in a bid to force through the switch, as Barcelona initially refused to sanction the switch. The Nou Camp outfit had sent Suarez an email naming the clubs he was not allowed to sign for as a free agent. Barcelona was keen to get the Uruguay striker off their wage bill and Juventus looked to be his likely destination until a deal fell through. That opened up a potential move to Atletico, but when Barca blocked the transfer, Suarez warned he would publish the private emails to show they were not one of the clubs included on the list. Teams believed to have been included on the list were the likes of Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid.

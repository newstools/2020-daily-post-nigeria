He called on the new members to work with other members of the PDP and support government in its effort towards arresting criminality and bringing development to Adamawa State. The State Chairman of the PDP, Barr. Tahir Shehu called on the people of Mubi zone, from where the decampees came to Yola, to continue to rally round politicians with good track records. In his remark, Alhaji Abubakar Wambai who led his supporters to Yola for the reception into the PDP, said with his defection to the ruling party, APC is completely dead in the northern part of Adamawa State. At the APC Secretariat, the state party Chairman, Alhaji Ibrahim Bilal, announced to party members who gathered in honour of a departed former official of the party, that ex-Governor Bala Ngillari had joined the party from the PDP. Bilal said, “Ngillari decamped to APC after long consultation, and he joined the progressive party with thousands of his supporters. “He told me verbatim that his coming to APC is not to look for any position but to enjoy freedom of political aspiration.”

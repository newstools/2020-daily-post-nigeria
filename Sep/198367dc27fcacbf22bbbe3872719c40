As part of efforts to improve disaster management and hitch-free by-elections in Lagos State, the Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu, has sealed a deal with the State Acting Coordinator, National Emergency Management Agency(NEMA), Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye and the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mr. Sam Olumekun to work together when the need arises. The police boss said the collaboration became necessary to make the Police, NEMA and INEC proactive in ensuring the protection of lives and properties during electoral processes in the state. While discussing with the heads of the agencies in his Ikeja office, Odumosu expressed concern on various forecasts on flooding in Lagos State and plans to prevent such looming disasters. He, therefore, assured the NEMA boss in Lagos State that the Command would do the needful to support the agency whenever the needs arise, especially while on rescue operations and or disaster management within the state. In his response, the NEMA boss hinted the Commissioner of Police of the agency’s plans to forestall unwarranted disasters in the state as the Federal House of Representatives has made frantic efforts to pass a bill that will manage and regulate the opening of dams during the raining season, which will curb perennial flooding in the affected areas. In the same vein, the INEC boss, Mr. Sam Olumekun, also revealed his agency’s plan to embark on certain electoral processes in Lagos State as a measure to plan ahead of the forthcoming by-elections and other general elections in the state. To assure the police support, the CP highlighted security plans and checks being put in place, in line with the provisions of relevant laws of the land to midwife elections in the state, particularly, the forthcoming by-elections in the state. The Police chief also assured all Lagosians of police commitment to having free, fair, credible and acceptable elections in Lagos State.

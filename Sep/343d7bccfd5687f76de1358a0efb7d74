The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said the delay in the receipt of collated results of the governorship election from local government areas in Edo is responsible for the delay of collation at the State level. INEC National Commissioner, May Agbamuche-Mbu, on Sunday in Benin, made this known while speaking to newsmen and party agents at the State collation centre, INEC headquarters, Benin. Agbamuche-Mbu said that the commission is still expecting results from the 18 local government areas of the State.
She said: “This is to inform everyone that INEC is still waiting for results from the local government areas. “I am sorry we all have to wait before we start collation. “ According to her, just one local government has arrived in the centre, NAN reports.
She added that the commission would wait until at least, when results from seven local government areas arrive in the centre before they start collation. “We do not want anybody to cast aspersions on us. So, the commission is going to wait,” Agbamuche-Mbu added.

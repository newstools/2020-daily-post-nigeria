Timo Werner has admitted he had doubts about signing for Chelsea after they were thrashed by Bayern Munich at Stamford Bridge. Bayern, who went on to win the Champions League trophy, defeated Chelsea 3-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie, thanks to a Serge Gnabry brace and a goal from Robert Lewandowski. Werner was left shocked by the result and had second thoughts about moving to Stamford Bridge. The German striker eventually made the £53 million switch from RB Leipzig. When asked if he was shocked by the manner of their elimination, also losing 4-1 away from home to get dumped out 7-1 on aggregate, Werner told Sport Bild: “I would be lying if I said it wasn’t like that. “The 3-0 home defeat of Chelsea in the first leg against Bayern didn’t exactly speak in favour of going to London. “I have to say that openly because with Leipzig we always played very good and close games against Bayern.” —

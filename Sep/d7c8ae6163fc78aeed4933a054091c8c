The Malian military will this weekend hold transition talks with political parties and civic organizations. Also to participate is the June 5 Movement. The group launched protests that led to President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s resignation. Voice of America quoted a junta spokesman as saying the Saturday and Sunday discussions would be on producing a blueprint for the transition. A second round of talks will be held next week in Bamako, Mali’s capital. Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) recently rejected the coup leaders’ plan for a three-year transition. The region’s leaders want civilian transition and elections within a year. Head of the new junta visited Keita on Thursday in a Bamako hospital he was admitted for a stroke-related condition. Keita will be allowed to seek additional medical treatment abroad. The military had hinted that the ousted leader would be sent to another country.

A teenage apprentice trader whose identity is yet to be ascertained has drowned in a flood at the Ochanja market round-about in Onitsha, Anambra State. The victim who drowned on Tuesday following a heavy downpour which caused a huge flood that submerged the entire vicinity. According to a source, the boy was swept off his feet when he wanted to get out of a shop where he had sought refuge while it was still raining at about 4.30pm on the fateful day. “As he stepped out he laid his foot on the plank used to cross the gutter, that served as a bridge between the shop and the road and immediately the plank broke and he fell into the deep gutter and drowned. “In a bid to rescue him when he fell into the drainage system, some sympathisers defied the rain and put some planks and other heavy objects into the gutter to cause an obstruction and possibly help the body of the boy to float, but to no avail,” the source said. A search party comprised of traders and some motorists who went up to Nwangene river to know if it would be able to see the corpse were disappointed as they returned empty-handed.

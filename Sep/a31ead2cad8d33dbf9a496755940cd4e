Buhari, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Saturday, consoled with former Head of State, Yakubu Gowon over the loss of a good friend, confidant and prayer partner. He sympathized with Thahal’s wife, Mrs Atsa Thahal and daughter, Dr Adzira Thahal as well as all former members of staff of the Nigeria Airways and the entire aviation industry. The president believes that the resonating testimonies from the life of the deceased had proved him to be a man dedicated to promoting the kingdom of God on earth.

Former Adamawa State Acting Governor, James Barka, has dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC). Barka is back to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He officially announced his return on Thursday in Yola, the state capital. Barka was Nigeria’s Ambassador to Tunisia, during President Goodluck Jonathan administration. He defected to the APC from the PDP in 2014. “I only veered off into the APC, leaving my teeming supporters behind. As you can see, I’ve returned home,” NAN quoted him as saying. Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, in his remarks, urged other prominent citizens to join or return to the PDP. “Our doors are open to well-meaning individuals and groups of people who would support the development of our dear party, state and country,” he said.

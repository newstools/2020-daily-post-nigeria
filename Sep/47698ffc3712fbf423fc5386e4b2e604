The MD/CEO of T Pumpy Concept Limited, developers of T Pumpy Estates, Abuja, Mr. Akintayo Adaralegbe, has explained why T Pumpy remains the best choice for subscribers and investors. According to him, all T Pumpy lands are verifiable with authentic Certificate of Occupancy (C-of-O). Addressing newsmen recently, Mr. Akintayo said all lands at T Pumpy Estates in Lugbe, Karasana, Kuje, and others have C-of-O. “All our lands are verifiable with authentic Certificate of Occupancy. We did all that because we wouldn’t want the authority to come disturb our residents.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-842175" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0026.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="540" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0026.jpg 960w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0026-300x169.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"> “We started a few years ago, our vision is to be leading real estate outfit in this subsaharan. “T Pumpy will continue to give nothing short of the best. “Recently, we announced a mega promo tagged Quadruplex. “This is a four in one promo that cuts across everyone.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-842181" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0023.jpg.webp" alt="" width="621" height="878" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0023.jpg.webp 621w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0023-212x300.jpg.webp 212w" sizes="(max-width: 621px) 100vw, 621px"> “One of the packages, which is so dear to me is the T Pumpy Children Estate. “The new promo allows kids from ages 0-17 to own a plot of land for just N399,000 through their parents. Mr. Adaralegbe, added that the promo, which was unveiled on Monday, September, 1 2001, would run from now till the end of the year 2020.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-842178" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0027.jpg" alt="" width="907" height="605" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0027.jpg 907w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0027-300x200.jpg.webp 300w" sizes="(max-width: 907px) 100vw, 907px"> “I know some people would ask, how possible it is because the law forbids underage from owing a landed property, but that is not an issue, the parents would sign on behalf of the child. By the time the child turns 18, the land automatically becomes his or hers. If you recall that when we signed Oreofeoluwa Lawal-Babalola of the Mummy Calm Down fame; as one of our ambassadors, it was the mother that signed on his behalf. So, with this, even a day old child can own a land through their parents.” On the build yourself promo, Mr. Adaralegbe said, “Build Your Self is a package that allow the subscriber to buy our land, build yourself and the house is all yours. Note that all the lands come with certified Certificates of Occupancy.” Speaking further, the MD/CEO said the only requirement needed before partaking in the ongoing Rent to Own promo is that one must have a job and must be citizen of Nigeria.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-842183" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0021.jpg.webp" alt="" width="720" height="1080" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0021.jpg.webp 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0021-200x300.jpg.webp 200w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG-20200922-WA0021-683x1024.jpg.webp 683w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> “This package will be beneficial to all classes of income/salary earners. ‘Rent to Own’ package is available at our newly-acquired locations across Kyami, Life Camp, Katampe, Jabi, Jahi, Wasa, Kuje, all in Abuja with C-of-Os. “This offer is expected to last from now till the end of the year.” The T-Pumpy Concept team have decades of providing industry-acclaimed off-site home designs and constructions.

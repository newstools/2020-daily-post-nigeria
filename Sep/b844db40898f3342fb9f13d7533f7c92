Big Brother Naija, BBNaija lockdown housemate, Nengi has apologised to Biggie for flouting the house rules. Nengi was issued a fine earlier on Thursday morning for microphone infringement. Explaining herself, Nengi said she was in a hurry to hear the brief by the head of the house and forgot her microphone. She apologised for her actions, saying she feels guilty that her action may cost the housemates their wager this week. Nengi said: “I take responsibility for my actions, I’m sorry Biggie it would not happen again. “I feel so terrible because I don’t like to be the reason why people fail and feel guilty. “Moving forward I’ll be as careful as I can be. “It’s just weird that this week I’m supposed to be on my best behaviour. I have an infringement. “I’ve not been my best this week and that might affect the house winning the task but aside that we are on the path to winning the wager.”

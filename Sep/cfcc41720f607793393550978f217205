Organisers of Big Brother Naija, BBNaija Lockdown have come under attack over the drama caused by Erica last night. Erica caused a scene in the house after she insulted Laycon and threatened him. She also took things took far and poured water on the HOH bed preventing Prince from staying on the bed. However, speaking on Sunday morning with Kiddwaya, she said she was under emotional stress and was not granted access to see a specialist. While some viewers and celebrities think Erica’s attitude was caused by the influence of alcohol at the Saturday night party, others said she needs mental health checkup and should not be ignored. Uti Uwachukwu, who is a fan of Erica took to his Twitter page on Sunday morning calling out the organisers for ignoring Erica’s mental state of health. He urged the organisers to value mental health of housemates and send in specialists when the need arises. His tweet read: “Mental health should be taken seriously.BIG BROTHER NIGERIA should use this as a medium to stress the value of mental health by sending in a specialist. “After all if it was a physical injury would they ignore the housemate or send in a Doctor? #Bbnaija please lead by example.”

Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has appealed to the Joint Health Sector Unions (JOHESU) to call off the strike as the country needs them now amid the COVID-19 pandemic. He said that the Federal Government would continue to do its best to push through the negotiations with the JOHESU to resolve all issues and call its members back to work. Mustapha stated this at the daily briefing of the task force on Thursday in Abuja. “Let me once again send a strong appeal to all health workers particularly, JOHESU members, that the nation can ill-afford any further disruption to its health systems,” Mustapha said. “The on-going strike has been very costly in terms of human lives, but such losses can be avoided. “Government shall continue to do its best to push through the negotiations with the unions, and hopefully, reason shall prevail.” DAILY POST recalls that the FG had provided an update on JOHESU’s strike a few days ago.

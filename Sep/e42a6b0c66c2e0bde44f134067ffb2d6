One person has been confirmed dead in an accident that occurred around Isara bridge, on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. A bus was said to have rammed into two men who were by the roadside fixing the axle problem of their trailer. While one person died, two others were said to have sustained serious injuries in the crash involving five persons. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps has confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Thursday. The road accident, which occurred around 1:30pm involved an Iveco trailer with registration number, KTU 608 XW and a Ford bus marked, LND 631 XX. The Ogun TRACE Spokesman, Babatunde Akinbiyi, blamed that crash on reckless driving or lack of concentration on the part of the bus driver, as it “rammed into a stationary trailer fixing its axle problem.” Akinbiyi said, “We learnt that the commercial bus was chartered by the two passengers in it along with the driver to purchase eggs in Lagos, when, due to lack of concentration and recklessly driving, rammed into a stationary trailer, whose axle problem was being fixed by the driver and the motor boy in the middle of the road. “One of the passengers in the bus died on the spot while the driver and the other passenger are recuperating in Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, OOUTH, Sagamu.” Meanwhile, the two vehicles have been taken to the Police Motor Traffic Division, Ode-Remo, it was learnt.

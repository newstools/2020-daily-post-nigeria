Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest injury updates on Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic ahead of his side’s Carabao Cup fourth-round tie against Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday night. Ziyech and Pulisic have been sidelined in the past few weeks due to injury. The duo missed Chelsea’s 6-0 victory against Barnsley in the Carabao Cup’s third-round tie last Wednesday and also their 3-3 draw with West Brom in the Premier League. But Lampard is now saying that Ziyech and Pulisic are not far away to return to action for the Blues. “Ziyech and Pulisic are not far away,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying. “They are still in their recovery stage, so it is too early for them both [to play against Tottenham].” The kick-off time for the game is 7:45, Nigerian time.

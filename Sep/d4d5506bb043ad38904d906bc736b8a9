Youths in Kaura Local Government Area, on Wednesday, demanded the unconditional release of kidnapped caretaker committee chairman of Kaura Local government area. DAILY POST recalls that the Chairman was kidnapped penultimate Sunday while on a bike to his farm. The motorcycle rider, who conveyed him was immediately shot dead, while the chairman was taken away by the kidnappers. Since then, nothing has been heard from them. The youths in the area, under the auspices of “Kaura Youth Coalition”, made the demand in a statement issued and signed by their President, Comrade Derek Christopher. They expressed shocked over the unfortunate abduction of the Chief Security officer of Kaura Local Government Area. They called on the State government and relevant security agencies to redouble their efforts towards ensuring the safe return of their chairman. Kaduna State and its environs have been in serious security challenges overtime, as kidnappers continue to raid communities, kill, kidnap, burn houses and property at will. In some occasions, they demanded huge amount of money as ransom from the relatives of their victims. In most cases, some victims are being killed, even after ransom was paid.

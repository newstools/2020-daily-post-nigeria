The Premier League is bringing kickoff for the Premier League clash between Liverpool and Arsenal forward by 15 minutes to 8pm on Monday night. The UK Mirror reports that the decision was made following the governmentâ€™s new lockdown measures on pubs. The Premier League is set to announce that the tie will kick off earlier to avoid a situation where landlords face closing venues while the match at Anfield is still going on. Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on Tuesday announced new restrictions amid the COVID-19 crisis, including pubs, bars and restaurants being subject to the 10pm curfew. With Liverpool vs Arsenal due to kick off at 8.15pm, the full-time whistle would not have been blown before the curfew.

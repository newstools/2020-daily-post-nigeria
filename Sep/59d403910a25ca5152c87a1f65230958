Daniel James could be set for a Manchester United exit, with Leeds planning to send in a second bid for the player, the UK Sun reports. The 22-year-old was set to sign for Marcelo Bielsa’s side in January 2019, before his move from Swansea fell through on transfer deadline day. James eventually joined United for £18million in June last year, but barely featured at the end of last season. The Wales winger started just one of the club’s final 10 fixtures. James was on from the start during their 3-1 defeat to Crystal Palace on Saturday, but was replaced by Mason Greenwood at the break. Bielsa feels he can land James for around £12million plus add-ons. Leeds could also consider a loan move for the out-of-favour youngster.

The crisis rocking the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State has continued to unfold in different perspectives, as a group loyal to Sen. Jeremiah Useni has disassociated itself from the elective congress of the party held last Saturday in Jos. Useni, a gubernatorial candidate of the party in the 2019 general elections while addressing some stakeholders in Jos, described the congress as a “charade”. The former FCT minister expressed surprise at the decision of the independent caretaker committee headed by Sen. Suleiman Adokwe to organise a congress with so many outstanding unresolved issues. He said that the caretaker committee was constituted by the National Headquarters as recommended by Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue State to reconcile the groups and conduct the elections within 30 days. “To our surprise, the committee which was constituted on Wednesday arrived in Jos on Friday night and decided to conduct the congress on Saturday. “As far as I am concerned there was no election. “I suggest that where you have three candidates, agree on one that will lead us. “We will see how the headquarters will manage two executives in Plateau,” he said. He advised the party members to conduct themselves in a peaceful manner as they pursue their legitimate rights. Also speaking, a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon. Bitrus Kaze and a chairmanship aspirant said that the fight was not for the PDP, but the development of Plateau. Kaze who represented Jos South/Jos East Constituency between 2007 to 2015, said that he is prepared to run the race with the support of the members of the party. Other members of the group made up of past state and national elected officers of the party expressed support for Senator Useni. They vowed not to leave the party but would fight to restore its glory. They have also resolved to take all necessary action towards finding a logical conclusion to the challenges facing the party.

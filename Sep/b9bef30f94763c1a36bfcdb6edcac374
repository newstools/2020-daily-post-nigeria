Evicted Big Brother Naija housemate, Tolanibaj has said putting up Vee for possible eviction last week had nothing to do with her feelings for Neo. Tolanibaj made this known in her post eviction interview with Ebuka. The singer said she took the decision to give Wathoni another chance in the game. Recall that Tolanbaj had nominated Vee and Praise to be evicted from the house. She said “Nominating Vee was just me being strategic. It was Vee, Wathoni, Trickytee and Praise that were up, so I already knew people would vote Vee to stay. “I knew wathoni needed to be saved, so I chose a risk to save Wathoni, knowing that Vee would be saved.” Tolanbaj also revealed that if there was room for relationship with Neo, she would date him. According to her, Neo had told Erica that she was attractive, and she told Erica that she was feeling him too. “I also said if there was room for that, then I was going to hook up on it.” Tolanibaj had a relationship with fellow housemate, Prince but the relationship crashed because Prince was not expressive enough, according to her.

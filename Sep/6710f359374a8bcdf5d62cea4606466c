Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State has charged his counterpart in Edo State, Governor Godwin Obaseki to be magnanimous and graceful in victory. Okowa gave the charge when Gov. Obaseki led a team on a “Thank You” visit to Okowa in Asaba. In a statement issued on Wednesday by the media unit of the Delta Government House, Okowa congratulated Obaseki for the victory recorded in the election and urged him ‘not to allow the lions and the tigers to torment the people again’. Okowa expressed appreciation to God for the victory, saying that he was inspired to support Obaseki because of his humility and the fact that he was being oppressed. “I want to congratulate you once again, and I feel very excited that you won the election. “I believe God did this in your life because you have proven to be a very humble man and people who boast too much don’t usually end well. “I urge you to show lots of magnanimity and grace, but do not allow the lions and the tigers to torment the people again. “May God give you the enabling grace to fulfil all your campaign promises. “Your people are expecting a lot from you because of their huge support, and I pray that God assists you with more funds to provide for the needs of the people. “I thank all our party members and the Edo people for their resilience in ensuring your re-election. “Now that we are all in the same political party, it makes it easier for us to relate with ourselves in this region,” he said. DAILY POST reports that the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, had on September 20 declared Obaseki winner of the Saturday’s governorship election in Edo State. Obaseki who is the PDP’s governorship candidate, defeated his closest rival, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) with a total of 307,955. Ize-Iyamu, however, polled a total of 223,619.

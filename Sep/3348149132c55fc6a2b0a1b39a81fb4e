Founder of the Reformed Peoples Democratic Party (R-PDP), a breakaway faction of mainstream PDP in Adamawa State, Dr Umar Ardo, has reacted to the split in the faction, attributing it to greed among departing members. The state chairman of the faction, Alhaji Jauro Gire, had led some other members of the faction back to the mainstream PDP on Thursday, saying they had reconciled their differences with the PDP. Ardo, who formed the R-PDP last year and put up some structures, including executive committees from State to ward level in February this year, said the decision of some key members to leave the fold was informed by greed. According to him, some of the members left because rice meant for the less privileged was not given to them. “For the R-PDP, there is a huge relief; good riddance to bad rubbish. Now we will inject real people with real political values in our movement. You have seen their own, wait and see our own,” he said. Ardo described the chairman of the faction and the others who left with him as political jobbers who depend on handouts to survive. He said, “Yes, some few members of R-PDP, including the acting state chairman and secretary and few miscreants have left us to join forces with the decadent regime and the illegal PDP structures in the state. “Their main reason for doing so is that I distributed rice and did not give them. On this, l plead guilty. But then the rice l distributed was to the less privileged Adamawa indigenes who are ravaged by the poor, bad and corrupt government policies in the state accentuated by the coronavirus lockdown. “The rice was not meant for political jobbers, hangers-on and leaches like them who depend on handouts to survive.”

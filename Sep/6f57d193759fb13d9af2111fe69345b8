Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social media, Lauretta Onochie has reacted to Pastor David Ibiyeomie’s attack on a popular On Air Personality (OAP), Daddy Freeze. Onochie took to her official Twitter account on Friday to condemn Ibiyeomie’s threats to kill Freeze. She also called out the Nigeria Police Force to take action against Ibiyeomie, describing the pastor’s action as ‘evil’. DAILY POST recalls that it all started when Freeze criticized Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church for saying women should submit to their husbands. Reacting, Ibiyeomie called the media personality a bastard, threatening to kill him. In a viral video from his last Sunday’s service, the Port Harcourt-based Pastor threatened to deal with Freeze. He also cursed the day Freeze was born. And reacting to the development, Onochie tweeted: “THIS IS EVIL. I am a Christian. I have been watching this absurdity for days now, looking for any attribute of Christ in it. I haven’t seen any. “Among others, threatening to kill someone is a crime. I’m not sure if this requires a petition to the @PoliceNG before they act. EVIL!”

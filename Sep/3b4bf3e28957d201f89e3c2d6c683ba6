The Bishop of Anglican Communion, Diocese of Kaduna, Timothy Yahaya, has observed with dismay that insecurity in the country has made life nasty, brutish and short. He stated that insecurity in the country has reached an alarming dimension that not only needs an emergency stakeholders approach but a total overhaul of Nigeria’s security architecture for a possible solution. In an address delivered on Friday at the 3rd session of the 21st Synod of the Anglican Church in Kaduna, Bishop Timothy Yahaya noted that presently in the country, it is either Boko Haram, gunmen, banditry, kidnapping, yahoo boys, or herdsmen, stressing that the life of a man has become very cheap. He appealed for renewed efforts by the government to ensure normalcy returns to the country especially in a situation where citizens die carelessly on a daily basis due to insecurity. The Bishop called on the Buhari-led government to take proactive measures towards decisively addressing the challenges facing Nigerians with a view to giving Nigerians hope, saying, “In our case, citizens die needlessly on a daily basis and life moves on as if it is normal.” Speaking on the insecurity in Kaduna State, the cleric observed that the rate of insecurity in the state was alarming, adding that kidnapping, banditry and all kinds of criminality seems to be on the increase. He asked the Kaduna State government to go back to the drawing board with the state Police Command, the Military, Civil Defence, and other security agencies in a bid to win the war against crime and criminality. On the Company and Allied Matters Act 2020, the Bishop noted that section 839 (1) and (2) which empowers the commission to suspend trustees of an association (in this case, the Church) and appoint the interim managers to manage the affairs of the association for some given reasons is ill-advised and need critical re-examination.

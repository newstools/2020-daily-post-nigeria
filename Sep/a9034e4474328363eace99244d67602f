A Rivers State High Court has convicted and sentenced four persons to death by hanging. The four convicts, Oluchi Mma Charles, Miracle Anumuna, Ifeanyi Simon, Koko Basseyand Uchenna Stanley Amaechi were sentenced to death for the kidnapping and murder of Anthony Okoro who worked for Shell Petroleum Development Company, SPDC. They had also demanded a twenty million naira ransom from the family of the victim but never received the funds since the family insisted on hearing from the kidnapped oil worker. Two other defendants in the matter; Chukwudi Etete and Anthony Ugwu were discharged and acquitted in what the Court said the prosecution could not prove their involvement in the case. The trial Judge Justice George Omereji in his judgment ruled that the evidence and exhibits tendered before the court show that the prosecution proved that the first, second, third, fourth and seventh defendants actually committed the crime as charged. Justice Omereji ruled that the convicts were also responsible for, “stealing a Range Rover Sport Jeep, Kia Optima Car, Infinity Mobile Phone, Flat Screen Television sets belonging to the victim,” whose corpse is still not found till date. He ruled that the convicts be hanged until they are dead. While defendants counsels declined to speak on the Judgment, the prosecution counsel, I.N Ubulom in an interview with newsmen welcomed the Judgment. The convicts were charged on 10 counts of murder, armed robbery, Illegal possession of firearms, kidnapping, stealing and impersonation, a crime which is believed to have been committed on the 29th May 2016 at number one Okoro Avenue, in Rumurolu in Woji Community in Obio-Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State.

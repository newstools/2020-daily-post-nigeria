The Niger State Police Command has arrested one Mohammed Idris Abubakar for allegedly defrauding POS operators in Minna and other parts of the state to the tune of N1.2 million. Checks revealed that the fraudster, within a year of his operation in various parts of the town and its environs scammed more than 20 operators in the state. It was also gathered that the suspect, who also paraded himself as a soldier could generate fake alerts to scam his victims. But, his activities came to an end, last week Monday, when the Police arrested him in his Mercedes Benz golden colour with Reg. No. California 5JUZ 074, while driving around the town and hunting for his next victim. The state Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Wasiu Abiodun confirming the incident told DAILY POST that the suspect is in the custody of the command over alleged fraud and impersonation. He revealed that Mohammed Idris Abubakar, 26 years of Sabi Nasarawa Bosso area of Minna has defrauded POS operators within and outside Minna of N1, 263, 000.00.

Godwin Obaseki, the Governor of Edo State, has declared that he will bury his predecessor and former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Adams Oshiomhole politically if he (Obaseki) emerges winner of the September 19 governorship election. The Governor said this on Saturday during the closing moments of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, campaigns in Oredo local government. According to the Governor, who was once Oshiomhole’s ally, the forthcoming poll is about contesting with Oshiomhole. He accused the former Governor of disrespecting the people of Benin kingdom. “As a sitting Governor, Oshiomhole decides to pick who will represent me in my House of Assembly. “Can you imagine the insult? That was where this fight started,” Obaseki said. “Because he believes, in his own mind, that Benin people are like chickens – when you throw corn, they will run after the corn. “This election is a contest with Oshiomhole. We have dealt with him at the national level, we will bury him politically in this election; because he has no regard for Benin people, he has no regard for us in Oredo, and we will show him that he is nothing,” he added. Four years ago it was the APC, Oshiomhole and Obaseki against Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and the PDP but this year, the reverse is the case.

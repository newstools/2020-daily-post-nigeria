Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has insisted that the outcome of the forthcoming governorship election in the State would determine the chances of the South-West in the 2023 presidency. Akeredolu said this after he mobilised traditional rulers to have a meeting with the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu. This was shortly after commissioning the Revenue House to mark his second term kick-off. Although Tinubu is yet to confirm if he would run for the foremost position, the former Lagos State Governor is believed to be eyeing the 2023 presidency. Tinubu’s political foot soldiers are already putting pseudo pressure groups and campaign outfits ahead of the contest. And Governor Akeredolu stressed that what happens in Ondo in October would go a long way to determine chances of the South-West in the 2023 presidency. “The October 10 election in Ondo State is not about Akeredolu but about the future of Ondo State and the entire Yoruba nation because whatever the outcome will be shall determine our seriousness in the quest for the 2023 presidency,” the governor said.

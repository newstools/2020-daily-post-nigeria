The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Edo State has accused a National Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, Dr. Mustapha Leeky, of acting the script of a former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and the opposition party in Edo State. The PDP said there are plots to subvert the will of people of the State in the governorship election coming later in the month. Spokesman of the PDP in the State, Chris Nehikhare, made the claim when he addressed journalists in Benin City, on Friday. He said that INEC Chairman was working hand in hand with Oshiomhole and the candidate of the APC, Ize-Iyamu, to disrupt the process for the engagement of the various Ad-hoc staff to be used by INEC in the election. “The time-honoured tradition which mandates that all political parties involved in the electioneering process submit names of persons to be used as Ad-hoc staff is being abused by Dr. Leeky and his collaborators in the APC,” he claimed. “Dr. Leeky, it has been gathered, has skewed the process to ensure it favours one party, whereby the final list released for training of the adhoc staff has a ratio of 10:1, between the APC and all other parties”, Nehikhare said. Among other claims, the party Chairman said that the Polling Officers (PO), who are supposed to be serving National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members have been changed by the former Governor and Ize-Iyamu. He said that instead of NYSC members, they now have people nominated by APC chieftains to fill these positions to actualize their plans to rig the election.

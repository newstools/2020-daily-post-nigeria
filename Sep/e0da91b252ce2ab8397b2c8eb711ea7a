The Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Sadique Abubakar, has vowed that the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) will thoroughly deal with bandits. NAN reports that he made the pledge on Thursday while condemning the killing of civilians. The CAS spoke in Katsina during an on-the-spot assessment of Operation Wutan Daji Two, a subsidiary of Operation Hadarin Daji’ in the North-West. Abubakar noted that the operation targets locations of bandits in forests. Asked about operation timeframe, he said: “We don’t know, we will make sure until we catch the bandits in their nets. The fighting is not going to end until we make sure that no civilian is killed and we clear the bandits in forests.” He urged NAF officers to work with other security agencies against banditry, kidnapping, cattle rustling and other criminal acts. The Air Chief disclosed that he got briefs from the operation’s commanders on areas of changes and needs.

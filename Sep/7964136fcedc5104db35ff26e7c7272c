Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, Lockdown housemate, Neo, has told Vee that he wants the girl who asked him to sleep on her bed some night back in his life again. Neo stated this on Friday during a conversation with Vee in the house. Neo to Vee: “I know what I want, and what I want is that girl who asked me to sleep on her bed that night.” DAILY POST recalls that Vee had last Sunday told Neo that she is no longer interested in having a romantic relationship with him. Vee disclosed this after Neo offered a long, sober apology to her, following some games in the garden. “I do not think I want to do this anymore. “We can be friends, but I think we can properly figure this out when we are out of here. “Because I can’t imagine my family watching someone I care about treat me that way,” she said.

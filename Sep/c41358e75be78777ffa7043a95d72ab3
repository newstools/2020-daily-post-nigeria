The Ekiti State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) Hon Bisi Kolawole, has sent a congratulatory message to the Edo State Governor-elect, Godwin
Obaseki on his victory at the 20th September 2020 poll. The Party Chairman in a letter he personally signed and addressed to Governor Obaseki also congratulated the PDP structure in Edo State and praised the determination and the collective efforts of the people of the State for defending their votes. The PDP chieftain noted that the people courageously resisted the so-called “Federal might”, made their electoral choice and stood by what they believe will give them the dividends of democracy. The copy of letter which was made available to journalists via the party’s Publicity Secretary, Raphael Adeyanju in Ado Ekiti, on Tuesday, read:
“As we draw the curtain on the Edo State election, and are all set for the next one in Ondo State, I call on all stakeholders to borrow a leaf from the activities before the last election and pray for victory at the next polls. I am confident that the wave of victory is blowing and it will also be our portion in Ekiti State gubernatorial election, come 2022.” Kolawole called on all party faithful to join hands with the new executive to begin massive grassroot mobilization towards 2022 elections in Ekiti State. “We have all seen what happened in Edo State, how the will of the people prevailed over the massive forces of oppression. The situation in Ekiti State is not different. The people here are also clamouring for a change. Kolawole maintained that the development in Edo State had broken the myth of federal might to show that political power actually resides with the electorates who can determine who governs them. “We know that the ruling party will always attempt to impose their unpopular candidates on the people like they tried in Edo State, but with determination and collective effort we shall also defeat the forces of oppression ” , Kolawole said.

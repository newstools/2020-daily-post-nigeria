The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, says it recognizes Chief Marcellinus Nlemigbo, as the duly elected chairman of the Caretaker Executive Committee of the All Progressives Congress, in Imo State. The Electoral Umpire disclosed that it decided to recognize and deal with the Nlemigbo-led committee pending the hearing and determination of an appeal filed by APC. Recall that an Abuja High Court had on 16th of July, 2020, ordered that Mr. Daniel Madueke Nwafor desists from enforcing or giving effect to the judgment of the Court in FCT/HC/BW/CV/103/2018 delivered on 14th August, 2018, pending the hearing and determination of the appeal filed by APC. The APC National Chairman, Caretaker Committee requested the Electoral Commission to recognize the Caretaker Committee under the leadership of Chief Marcelinus Nlemigbo set up by the National Working Committee of the APC to oversee the affairs of the Imo State Chapter of the party pending the conduct of fresh congresses in Imo State. The matter was between Evan Enwerem vs. All Progressives Congress & 2 others. However, the INEC Headquarters, made its position known in a letter dated 1st September 2020 and signed by Secretary to the Commission, Rose Oriafan-Anthony and addressed to the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Imo State. A copy of the letter was made available to DAILY POST, on Monday afternoon. <img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-837710 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FB_IMG_1599481270042.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FB_IMG_1599481270042.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FB_IMG_1599481270042-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

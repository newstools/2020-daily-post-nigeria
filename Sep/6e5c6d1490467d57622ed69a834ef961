The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Commissioner of Police, Bala Ciroma, has ordered a probe of the death of Ifeoma Abugu. DSP Anjuguri Manzah, Public Relations Officer, made this known in a statement on Monday. Abugu is a graduate of the Institute of Management and Technology, IMT, Enugu State. She was arrested by the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) on September 10 when operatives stormed the residence of her fiancé, Adam Ugwunwa, in Wumba village, Lokogoma. The next day, the lady who recently concluded her National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) and had her introduction with Ugwunwa in Enugu days earlier, was dead. Manzah announced that Ciroma has ordered a post-mortem to unravel the cause of Abugu’s demise. “While sympathising with the family and friends of the deceased, the command wants to assure the public that it will be professional and transparent in the investigation”, the spokesman said.

Arsenal continued their preparation for the 2020/2021 season, with a 3-2 defeat against fellow Premier League side Aston Villa. The friendly took place at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. Just like the game in midweek against Queens Park Rangers, the Gunners did not allow streaming, as Mikel Arteta fine-tuned his squad. However, the club’s official social media handle confirmed they lost to Villa, with captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scoring twice. Arteta’s men have now played two preseason games since they beat Liverpool to lift the Community Shield. Arsenal begins their league campaign next Saturday away at the newly-promoted Fulham.

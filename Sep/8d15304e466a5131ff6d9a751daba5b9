Former heavyweight boxer, Mike Tyson, has said he got erections from boxing when he was younger. In an interview with Joe Rogan, the 54-year-old described a fight as ‘orgasmic’. Tyson is preparing to make a comeback in November, having agreed on a deal to face Roy Jones Jr, 51, in an exhibition bout. Ahead of the fight, he opened up about the emotions he feels before and during bouts. “It’s orgasmic sometimes,” Tyson said. He followed up by asking Rogan: “What does it mean when the fighting gets you erect? “Well, that’s how I’d get when I was a kid. Sometimes I’d get the twinkle.” Tyson has not entered the ring since losing to Kevin McBride in 2005.

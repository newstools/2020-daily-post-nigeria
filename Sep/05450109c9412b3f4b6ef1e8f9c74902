Disqualified Big Brother Naija lockdown housemate, Erica has said that her sad times took precedence, leading to the abrupt end of her journey in the reality show. In a statement she shared on Instagram on Tuesday, the reality TV star recounted her journey in the lockdown house. Erica was thrown out of the lockdown house after she flouted major rules of the house. She had even threatened to kill fellow housemate Laycon outside the reality TV show. Erica was also found guilty of pouring water on the Head of House bed to prevent her Deputy, Prince from having access. Having been issued two strikes earlier it was obvious that the Abia-born housemate’s stay in the house would end abruptly. In her statement shared on Instagram, she thanked her fans for the overwhelming support for her. She said, “July 19th was the beginning of the rest of my life when I made the decision to be on the Bigbrother show. “Excited as I was, I couldn’t fathom what the future held. I stepped into the house as an open book, believing in my strengths and weaknesses which I bore for the world to see. “I was confident that these will enable me navigate through life in the house. Nothing, however, prepares you for the events of life except the experiences and the onus was on me to learn and live. “My experiences were at equilibrium as I made the best of friends, honed existing skills, discovered new ones, lived in the moment and partied away. However, my sad times took precedence and my journey was shortened.” Erica and her in-house lover, Kiddwaya are expected to reunite outside the show following the latter’s eviction from the house last Sunday. Kiddwaya has made it clear that he is ready to continue a relationship with Erica if she feels the same, adding that they have agreed to take things slowly

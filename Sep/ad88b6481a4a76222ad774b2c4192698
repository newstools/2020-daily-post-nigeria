An Ilorin based medical expert, Dr Oladayo David Awoyale, on Wednesday, advised Nigerians to imbibe the culture of making budgetary provisions for their healthcare. He gave the advice at a health talk during the monthly meeting of the National League of Veteran Journalists, NALVEJ, Kwara State chapter, held at the state council secretariat of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, in Ilorin. Dr Awoyale, State Deputy Epidemiologist in the Ministry of Health, said it was important for all age groups to pay attention to their health. Speaking on “The Importance of Lifestyle Modification in the Management of Hypertension” he described hypertension as an urban disease of adults, and anyone that has reached the age of 40 years is susceptible to it.” Dr Awoyale asserted that the disease was manageable and treatable if those afflicted use their medications regularly as prescribed by their doctors. He advised that “As we budget for food, clothes and other luxuries of life, we should also budget for our healthcare, adding that “Nigerians should check and monitor their blood pressure regularly.” Dr Awoyale, who argued that lifestyle modifications should be the first option for prevention of all diseases, submitted that drugs should be seen as the second option. To keep hypertension at bay, he advised Nigerians to take relaxation, exercise, and eating foods that have low fat seriously, just as he discouraged people from smoking and consuming alcohol, which he said constitutes risk factors.

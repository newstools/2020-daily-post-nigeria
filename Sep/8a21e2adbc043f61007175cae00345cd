The Kano State House of Assembly has urged the National Examination Council, NECO, to shift the Sept. 3, deadline for the registration of Senior Secondary Certificate Examination, SSCE, in the country. Speaking at a plenary on Wednesday, Mr Aminu Sa’ad (PDP-Ungoggo ) said that most parents were unable to register their children for the examination due to late release of qualifying examination by the State Government. “If you can remember, recently the state government ordered for the release of the qualifying examination results for 104,000 students. “Out of the 104,000 students, only 29,126 secured five credits and above, including Mathematics and English, representing about 15 per cent. “This is of great concern to us because it will affect the number of students from the Kano to be enrolled in higher institutions in the next academic year,” he said. Sa’ad also appealed to the state government to explore the possibility of sponsoring additional students for the examination due to the inability of parents to pay for their children, NAN reports.

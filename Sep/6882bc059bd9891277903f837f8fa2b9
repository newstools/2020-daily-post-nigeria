Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has revealed that it costs over N400,000 to treat a coronavirus patient. Governor El-Rufai made the claim when he addressed traditional rulers in the state on ways to curb the spread of the COVID-19 on Tuesday. The Governor said the State has to bear the cost of treatment of patients because many Nigerians cannot afford the bills. He explained, “Even though we’ve had very successful cases of treatment, Your Eminence, it is a very expensive process. “The last time I received the report, it cost about N400,000 to treat one Coronavirus patient. “Because he has to be isolated, he has to be fed and the cost of medicine has increased and even the personal protective equipment the doctors treating them have to wear when you add all this up it the average cost of treatment is over N400,000 per person. “It is a big drain on the treasury of the Government and we have to bear the cost because if we say that people should pay for the treatment of Coronavirus that would open the spread because who can pay N400,000 even in the government hospitals for treatment. “So Your Royal Highnesses, this is a battle that is yet to be won until we get vaccines and hopefully given a treatment.”

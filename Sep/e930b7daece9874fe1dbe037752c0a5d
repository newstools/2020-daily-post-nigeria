President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the inclusion of the Chairman, United Bank for Africa, Tony Elumelu among Time 100 Most Influential People of 2020. In a statement signed by Femi Adesina, his Spokesman, the President commended Elumelu’s vision of Africapitalism. According to Buhari, Elumelu’s vision espouses that Africa’s private sector must play a leading role in the continent’s development through long-term investments, entrepreneurship, and regional connectivity. Buhari said that it was just a matter of time before such caught global attention. Buhari, in the statement, said that “Elumelu’s commitment to the development of African youths, whom he has given a voice and empowerment, investing $5,000 in 1,000 young entrepreneurs per year across 54 countries, pedestals him as a visionary, with milk of human kindness, ‘and such, among others, must have qualified him for the Time Hall of Fame.’

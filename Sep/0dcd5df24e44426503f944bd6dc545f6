Manchester United’s latest offer for Jadon Sancho was worth up to £91.3m (€100m). However, Sky Sports reports that the bid has been rejected by Borussia Dortmund. The offer was for an initial £73m, rising to up to £91.3m. It, however, falls short of Dortmund’s £108m valuation. Sancho is not in the squad for their German Super Cup clash against Bayern Munich. Dortmund claim it is because of a “respiratory infection” and confirmed he has tested negative for COVID-19. A bid is expected from United this week, but Dortmund insist Sancho is staying in Germany. United are considering other options like Barcelona’s Ousmane Dembele.

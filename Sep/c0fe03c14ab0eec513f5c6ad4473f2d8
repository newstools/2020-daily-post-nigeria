The Nigeria Labour Congress, NLC, has criticized the federal government for the increment in pump price of petrol. NLC President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, said the 151 per litre increment was an indication that the federal government was taking Nigerians for granted. In a statement, Wabba said organized labour cannot guarantee industrial harmony in Nigeria. Wabba insisted that the federal government has betrayed the trust of Nigerians to protect them. According to Wabba: “In fact, Nigerians and even NLC we are in a shock, and this increase is coming at a time when many Nigerians are passing through very peculiar and precarious times. “It’s like Nigerian are being taken for a ride, the increase in price of petroleum is like adding salt to injury. “The increase in price of petroleum has happened now more than three times in three months. And to compound it they also reduced the interest rate of savings, which affects mostly the poor and the vulnerable. “While rejecting this with the strongest terms, I think Nigerian government is taking Nigerians for granted. “At the end of the day, Nigerians are becoming poorer and poorer, in fact, many people are already on the edge. Many workers are already on the edge. “Certainly we cannot guarantee industrial peace and harmony, and we will have to call our organs and we will have to also react but we reject it in its entirety. They have betrayed the trust of Nigerians, for Nigerians to be protected against the economic challenge that is affecting us.” Recall that the Nigerian government through the Pipelines and Product Marketing Company (PPMC), had announced an increment in the pump price of petrol to N151.56 per litre.

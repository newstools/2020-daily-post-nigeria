The Special Military Task Force in Plateau has arrested one Hussaini Isah believed to be the leader of ‘Sara-suka’, a cult group. The cult group operates in some parts of Jos North Local Government Area. Ten other suspects were arrested at Gangare community. Weapons recovered include knives, cutlasses, charms, among others. Maj.-Gen. Chukwuemeka Okonkwo, Force Commander, paraded the suspects on Saturday. “We shall not rest until petty crimes, killings and other forms of insecurity are stemmed down. These suspects are largely responsible for the crimes and all forms of disorder in Jos. “They kill innocent people on a daily basis; they are very dangerous human beings. We have redeployed our troops into the hinterlands, but we shall continue to raid communities in the city centre to halt these crimes,” he said. The military officer urged Plateau residents to support the task force.

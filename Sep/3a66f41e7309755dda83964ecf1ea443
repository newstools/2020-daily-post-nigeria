President Muhammadu Buhari has warned the All Progressives Congress (APC) to end “totally, unnecessary squabbles”, which has caused the ruling party to lose seats in legislative and gubernatorial elections. Buhari stated this on Monday, while inaugurating the tripartite consultative committee of the executive, legislature and leadership of the APC. The 11-member committee will be chaired by Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo. “But we must admit to ourselves that our party has been too often embroiled in bitter, and on occasions, totally unnecessary squabbles, causing us seats in the legislative and gubernatorial elections. “This never should have happened; we are here to make sure such occurrences never happen again. We must now ensure regular consultation between the party and the government. “I am a firm believer in the doctrine of separation of powers, which is fundamental to our constitutional democracy, but our practice should be harmonious checks and balances devoid of bitterness and petty rivalry,” Buhari said. Members of the consultative committee include: Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha; Chief of Staff, Ibrahim Gambari; Senate President Ahmad Lawan; Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, and Senate Majority Leader,
Yahya Abdullahi. Others are Speaker, House of the Representative, Femi Gbajabiamila; Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Wase; House Majority Leader, Ogor Okuweh; Chairman, APC Caretaker Committee/Yobe Governor, Mala Buni and Secretary, Committee; Akpan Udoedehe.

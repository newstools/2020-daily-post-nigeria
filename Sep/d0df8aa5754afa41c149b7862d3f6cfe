The Ruling All Progressives Congress in Kwara State, has rejected the judgement of the state House of Assembly Elections Petition Tribunal, which nullified the election of its candidate, Ahmed Adam representing Patigi constituency in the state Assembly. The tribunal on Monday, nullified the election of Adam over alleged irregularities in his names, and declared the PDP candidate, Salihu Yahaya Mohammed as winner of the bye election. Delivering the judgement, the Chairman of the tribunal, Aminat Aliyu, said ” Adam’s name on the EC9 form is different from the one on his primary school certificate, declaration of age, voter card and in the letter forwarded to the INEC on 15th January, 2019.” However, in a reaction, the state Publicity Secretary of the APC, Folaranmi Aro, in a statement in Ilorin, said, ” The judgement was based on the difference between ‘Adam’ and ‘Adama’ on the certificate of the candidate of the APC, even though the PDP never called any witness from the examination body to substantiate its claim, that the APC candidate was not the owner of the certificates tendered for his election.” He said, “The tribunal did not deny that we won the election overwhelmingly. “It instead hid under a feeble excuse that the names of our candidate on the two certificates he presented to the electoral body, are slightly different from each other to award our mandate to the opposition. “It is a sad day for democracy, as the judgement is a slap on the thousands of the electorate who stood in the sun to make their choice,” the party added. It described the judgement as “a violent attack on the position of the Supreme Court in many established cases where an alphabet was either omitted or added to a candidate’s name.” Asserting that the party will appeal the judgement, because it signals a danger for Nigeria’s democracy and stealing the mandate of the people, the party’s spokesman, said, “The judgement is a judicial subversion of the mandate of the people.”

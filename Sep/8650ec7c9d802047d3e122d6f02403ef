Some men of the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) have allegedly shot one Mr. Idowu Moses at Oja Odan, Yewa North Local Government area of Ogun State. Idowu Moses, DAILY POST gathered, was the chairman of Nigerian Association of Panel Beaters, Oja Odan branch. Sources said some operatives of the NCS were in Oja Odan earlier on Saturday in about three patrol vehicles. Locals said they could not identify the real cause of what led to the shootings, reportedly from the customs personnel. “We didn’t know what happened. We just heard gunshots from the customs officers and we saw Idowu on the floor. This is not the first time things like this has been happening. We are tired,” an eyewitness recounted. It was said that the NCS officers fled the community immediately they discovered somebody was hit by their bullet. DAILY POST gathered that Idowu ran into coma as he was shot in the head. “The bullet entered his head. We rushed him to the hospital immediately. They told us to go and remove the bullet. We took him somewhere to remove the bullet and we took him back to the hospital after that. We are just praying he doesn’t die. He is presently in coma,” a source said anonymously. Contacted, the Ogun 1 NCS Area Command Spokesperson, Hammed Oloyede, told DAILY POST that he was not informed of the incident, asking our correspondent to give him time to make findings. Hours later, our correspondent contacted Oloyede again, but he said he was yet to be briefed.

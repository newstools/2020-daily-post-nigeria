Kai Havertz has undergone his medicals with Chelsea, as the club puts final touches to his transfer from Bayer Leverkusen, BILD reports. The 21-year-old is believed to have completed the medical on Sunday. Both clubs have agreed a stunning £90million deal for Havertz, which will break the British transfer record. Chelsea will pay an initial £70m with £20m in add-ons for the Germany international. Havertz joins the likes of Hakim Ziyech, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell and Thiago Silva, who have all completed their transfers to Chelsea ahead of the new season. The attacking midfielder will be officially unveiled by the Blues in the coming days. His arrival takes Frank Lampard’s spending this summer past the £230 mark.

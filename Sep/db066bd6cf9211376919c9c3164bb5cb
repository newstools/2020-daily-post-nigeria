Governor David Umahi has called for the immediate sack of some staff of Ebonyi State University. Umahi made the call while swearing-in local government area chairmen and other appointees at the state capital. The governor noted that the state university is overstaffed and has to be reduced to a bearable number. He, however, tasked the management and staff of the Ebonyi State University to make sacrifices of 20 percent of their salaries. According to him: “I appeal to EBSU to make sacrifices. I am happy that the board members are here. When the Federal institution, FUNAI university was challenged, every worker there sacrificed 20 percent of their salaries for the period of one year. “EBSU must make sacrifices. EBSU must reduce their workforce and those being reduced, I can give them money under SME to start businesses. “The employment of EBSU is the highest in the country for private or state universities. We don’t have such luxury, when you make sacrifices, we will make our sacrifices. “If you don’t want to make sacrifices, we will not make sacrifices. If they don’t want to score us well, then they can score us whatever they want. “But we are willing to support EBSU to make sacrifices, to ensure that the staffs and their families are paid their salaries” he stated

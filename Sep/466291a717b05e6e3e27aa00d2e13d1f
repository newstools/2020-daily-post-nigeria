Olusegun Bamgbose, National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has told the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the Saturday’s governorship election in Edo State, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, to blame the National Leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, for his loss to the incumbent Governor, Godwin Obaseki. According to Bamgbose, the Edo governorship election has brought a new development in the country’s electoral process, renewing the hope of Nigerians for a free and fair election come 2023. The senior lawyer pointed out, however, that the overbearing influence of the duo of the former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole and Tinubu never helped matters. “Oshiomhole elevated his personal interest, more than the party interest. He never knew that a bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush. It is evident, that he must have thought what happened in Lagos, as per Ambode, may repeat itself in Edo. He got it all wrong,” Bamgbose said in a chat with DAILY POST on Tuesday. “Tinubu won’t have been able to do to Fashola what he did to Ambode. Fashola clearly made it clear to Tinubu then, that with or without him, he will win second term, Tinubu became jittery and had to anoint him. “The truth of the matter is that, as at the time of bringing Ize-Iyamu on board, APC have cleverly isolated Oshiomhole and Tinubu. Buhari ordinarily would have waded in and save Obaseki, but Tinubu’s body language discouraged him. “Buhari has been trying to avoid a clash with him. Ize-Iyamu should therefore blame his electoral woes and misfortunes, on the isolated duo, Oshiomhole and Tinubu, OAT. “Like I once said, that Edo Election is a litmus test for Tinubu’s presidential ambition, Edo people have clearly rejected Tinubu. “This is sad. Ize-Iyamu should go back to the drawing table. There is still hope that he may one day be Governor of Edo State,” he said.

Big Brother Naija housemate, Lucy has said she can never be friends with Dorathy. Giving her reason, Lucy said Dorathy loves to make side comments about her especially when there’s an issue with housemates. According to Lucy, a true friend will not behave in such manner, hence she would not entertain her henceforth. Lucy said this during her diary session with Biggie on Friday evening. Lucy said: “ I would shun Dorathy if she comes to smile at me henceforth. I’m not interested in friendship with her anymore. “I hate side comments especially from someone I claim to be my friend. “

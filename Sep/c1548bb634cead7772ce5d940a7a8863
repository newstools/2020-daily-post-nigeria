New Arsenal goalkeeper, Alex Runarsson, has disclosed that the club’s goalkeeping coach, Inaki Cana, was one of the persons that convinced him to join the Gunners from French club, Dijon. Runarsson worked with Cana when they were both at Nordsjaelland FC in Denmark. The 25-year-old said that Cana was a key factor in him making a move to Arsenal, adding that both of them have always been in contact in the past four years. DAILY POST had reported that Runarsson officially joined Arsenal from Dijon on Monday. Arsenal announced the signing of Runarsson ahead of their Premier League clash with Liverpool on September 28. Speaking on Cana, Runarsson told Arsenal’s official website: “Our relationship, since we got to know each other four years ago, has been very good. “We have always been in contact even though I was playing in France, and he was coaching here in England. “The fact that he is here, it’s very important to me that I know somebody here and I know that he knows my qualities, and what I need to improve and what I can bring to the club. “I think we’ll be a very good match, for the second time in my career.”

Big Brother Naija housemate Kiddwaya has revealed that he now sees some housemates in a different light. The Billionaire son who said this during his media rounds on Monday also stated that he would wait for Vee, Laycon and Trickytee to come back home before he takes a decision. Kiddwaya who had promised to sponsor a music video for the three singers urged the interviewer to stop asking him questions about housemates in the house because he does not want to be used for clout. When asked if videos of housemates gossiping about him will dictate his relationship with them, he said, “I don’t want to talk about housemates in the house, I now see some of them in a different light. “Now that I am outside I’m seeing some people in a different way. I can’t deny the turns of those three, I will do something with those three but I’m going to wait for them to come out. “ I don’t want to mention anyone’s name. I feel as I talk about them they are growing themselves. You can’t be using me for clout. “Let them find their way and do their thing. Me mentioning their name too much they are growing, Let everyone be on their own.” Kiddwaya’s recent statement has generated reactions from viewers of the reality show who feel that he might have been shown videos of some housemates gossiping about him.

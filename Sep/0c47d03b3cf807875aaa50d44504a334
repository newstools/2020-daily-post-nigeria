Big Brother Naija, housemate, Prince has revealed the effect of living in the ‘lockdown’ house to his personality. Prince during his diary session with Biggie on Sunday said doing tasks has made him realize that nothing is impossible. According to him, he would not have learned to control himself and done most things if he did come for the show. Prince said, “BBNaija has taught me a lot of things I’ve never thought I’ll do.
“This show made me believe that everything is possible. I’ve learnt a lot here and met a lot of people. “Even though I’m not certain about my stay tonight I’m grateful for the lessons.”

The Appeal Committees of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has cleared all aspirants to contest the September 3 primaries for the concurrent legislative by-elections. The polls will be held in eight states on October 31. APC spokesman, Yekini Nabena, in a statement on Tuesday, said there are no preferred, pre-determined or anointed aspirants. He said the clarification was a response to a statement by party chieftain, Okoi Obono-Obla. Obono-Obla had alleged an attempt to “foist” a predetermined candidate on Cross River North Senatorial District. Nabena noted that the APC is moving in a new and progressive direction whereby things are done properly and internal democracy is the norm. “The party will continue to give all aspirants a level playing field while also ensuring that only those with impeccable records and are popularly elected are presented as APC candidates in all elections”, he added.

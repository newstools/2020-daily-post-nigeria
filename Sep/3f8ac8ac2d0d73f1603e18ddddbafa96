Juventus manager, Andrea Pirlo, has admitted that forward, Cristiano Ronaldo will be rested this season as the 35-year-old helped his team to beat Sampdoria in their first Serie A fixture on Sunday night at home. Juventus started their quest for a 10th consecutive Serie A title with a 3-0 victory against Sampdoria at Allianz Stadium in Pirlo’s first competitive match in charge of the Turin club. Goals from Dejan Kulusevski, Leonardo Bonucci and Ronaldo gave Juventus all three points against visitors. When asked how he plans to use Ronaldo this season, Pirlo said he will try to conserve the energy of the Portuguese international after starting their title defence with a win. “We’re thinking about [how to use Ronaldo] and talked it over,” Pirlo told Sky Sport Italia after the match. “He is not tired yet, as we just started, but when we come up to less important games, we will try to give him a rest. “He’s a very intelligent guy who knows his body very well, so he is aware of when it is time to rest or to step it up. When he will play depends on him.” Meanwhile, speaking after Juventus’ victory against Sampdoria, Ronaldo, in a post on Twitter, said: “It’s always good to start the season with a win! “Well done, team.”

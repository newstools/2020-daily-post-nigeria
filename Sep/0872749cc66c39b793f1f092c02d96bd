The Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, has said this administration inherited a “terribly” divided country from former president, Goodluck Jonathan, in 2015. Adesina, speaking on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Wednesday, insisted Nigeria has always been divided. He was responding to comments made by Nobel Laureate, Prof. Wole Soyinka backing another former President, Olusegun Obasanjo. “Nigeria had always been divided. Always. Right from amalgamation in 1914, Nigeria has always been divided. “Nigeria is an inconvenient amalgamation but we have worked at it and I tell you that there is no time in the history of this country that the country was not divided but then we had kept at it and we were trying to make it work. “As of 2015, when President Buhari came, Nigeria was terribly, terribly divided; divided along religious lines, divided along ethnic lines; divided along language, divided hopelessly, terribly and that is the division that the President had been working at. But you see that a lot of people instead of letting harmony return to this country, thrive and luxuriate in widening the gulf. They play politics with everything,” he said.

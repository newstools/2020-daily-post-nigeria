In order to avoid flooding, the Ogun State Government has told residents living in flood-prone areas in the state to relocate as the rains are here again. Some of the affected local governments are Abeokuta South, Abeokuta North, Sagamu, Ifo, Obafemi Owode, Ijebu-Ode, Ado-Odo/Ota, Yewa South, Ogun Waterside and Ijebu East. The Ogun State Commissioner for Environment, Abiodun Abudu-Balogun, gave this advice while addressing newsmen in Abeokuta on Monday. According to him, the ministry under his watch, has marked illegal structures built on waterways for demolition, adding that these structures would soon be demolished by the government. The Ogun State government listed about 40 communities in the said local governments as places that might be flooded during heavy downpour later in the year. Some of the areas include Lafenwa, Ago-Ika, Adedotun, Abule-Oyin, Sabo, Oriyanrin, Odemo/Totoro, INEC, Madojutimi, Olurunsogo, Gbangba, Ijeun Titun, Ago-Ijesha, Kuto, Ijeja, Amolaso, Citiview Estate, Riverview Estate, Primeview Estate and Arepo. Others are: Magada, Oke-Afa in Mogboro, Ariye, Jesuwalaye, Kara, Ewuga, Ayegbami, Ajegunle, Owa, Olosun Ijagun, Ogbo,, Ayetoro, Owode, Akweja, Abigi, Ebute Imobi, Makun-Omi and Ode-Omi. Earlier, the Nigerian Meteorological Agency had predicted that Ogun and some other will experience heavy flooding from September. In his words, Abudu-Balogun said, “Whether they are living on illegal structures or not, we shall continue to make sure that government protect them. That is why we are saying that yes, they might have done things that are wrong but because your lives are very important to the government, leave these flood prone areas. “But that’s not to say those structures will not go. Those structures will give way. “If you don’t relocate flood will sack you and take over the property. It is better to heed the advice.” He blamed the erection of illegal structures and dumping of refuse as factors responsible for the impending flood.

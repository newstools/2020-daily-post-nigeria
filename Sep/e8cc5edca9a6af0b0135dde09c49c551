The newly-elected chairman of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State, Hon. Chris Hassan, on Tuesday, assured party faithful that the new state executives would work extensively to ensure that they reconcile aggrieved members. Hassan stated this when he took over from the Independent caretaker committee constituted by the National Secretariat of the PDP, led by Sen. Suleiman Adokwe. The chairman commended the leadership of PDP for handling all the turbulences and problems that bedevil the party in the state. According to him, “We thank God they acted promptly where when needed them. “I want to assure members of this party that we are going to work extensively to bring about the much-needed reconciliation of party members. “Thank God that it has not gone that bad; and with the progress that had been made, I am confident that the issues would be resolved,” he stated. Hassan called on all stakeholders to join hands with the state working committee to reconcile the aggrieved members in the interest of the party. He maintained that the party belongs to the people and urged all aggrieved persons to shield their swords and work together. The chairman assured the out-gone committee that the new working committee was fully aware of the challenges before it. He further explained that, the first experiment is to win the Plateau South Senatorial bye-election slated for October 31. “The primary is around the corner and it is the first assignment before all of us as the state executives. “We will mobilize ourselves and go to southern zone and get what is rightly ours,” he stressed. In his address, Senator Suleiman Adokwe congratulated the new Executives on their victory. Adokwe, however, told them that they have heavy responsibility on their shoulders. He prayed God to give the new working committee the wisdom to discharge its responsibilities with transparency and commitment.

The All Progressives Congress, APC, has said it will humble all opponents to win the Oct 31st Lagos East senatorial and Kosofe state constituency 2 by-elections with a landslide margin. Chief Kaoli Olusanya, Vice Chairman, Lagos East disclosed this on Monday in Somolu during a meeting with ward chairmen of the party and council officials in the senatorial district, NAN reports. He said the party had delivered democratic dividends to Lagosians over the years, and residents trusted it for credible leadership. The Chairman of the party’s By-election Campaign Committee, also said residents would vote APC again and again. He promised that the party would reward members in wards and local government areas with the highest votes in the by-election. He, however, charged the party’s ward chairmen to mobilise votes at the grassroots for the APC to make the victory more emphatic. “We have great candidates in Mr Tokunbo Abiru and Mr Obafemi Saheed for Senate and Kosofe 2 respectively. The party is going to win well because we have done well for Lagosians. “But we want to challenge you, our Ward chairmen, you are the people at the grassroots. We want you to deliver massive votes for the party to make the victory very overwhelming. “We want you to reach out to the people around you, the market women, the CDAs, churches and mosques and deliver votes for the party. “We will get the figures at the end of the day and we promise you that wards and LGAs with the highest number of votes will be handsomely rewarded”, he said. Olusanya said the votes for the party across the senatorial district had reduced over the years, urging members to reach out to residents to come out and vote en masse for the APC. He also described Abiru as a trusted and tested candidate who would deliver if voted to represent Lagos East at the Senate.

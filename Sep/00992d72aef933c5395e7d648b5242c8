The Senate on Tuesday insisted that federal lawmakers did not receive any palliative from the Nigerian Delta Development Commission, NDDC. It was reacting to an allegation by the Executive Director (Projects) of NDDC, Cairo Ojuogboh, that National Assembly members got between N20m and 15m as COVID-19 palliatives. However, the Senate charged Ojuogboh to provide evidence of lawmakers who benefitted from the funds or publicly apologize for making such an allegation. The Senate issued the denial in a statement by the Chairman, Senate Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Ajibola Basiru. According to Basiru: “The Senate views with grave concern a statement credited to Dr Cairo Ojougboh, the Executive Director, Projects of the NDDC who alleged that National Assembly members received varying sums of money as COVID-19 palliative. “The Senate categorically denies that any Senator collected the sum of N20 million or any sum whatsoever from NDDC as Covid relief fund of for any purpose whatsoever. “The Senate challenges Dr Ojougboh to publicly provide evidence of his claim and list the names of the Senators he allegedly gave the alleged sum.”

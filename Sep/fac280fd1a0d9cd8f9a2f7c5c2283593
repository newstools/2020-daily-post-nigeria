Borussia Dortmund have confirmed Jadon Sancho has been left out of their squad for the German Super Cup game against Bayern Munich. The club claims Sancho is out with a “respiratory infection”. The two Bundesliga sides go head-to-head on Wednesday at the Allianz Arena, with a rule change meaning the fixtures will now be played at the home of the league champions and not the German Cup holders. Dortmund will also be without goalkeeper Roman Burki. The club however confirmed both Sancho and Burki had tested negative for coronavirus. The news comes with Manchester United plotting a last-gasp move for Sancho, 20, before the transfer window shuts on October 5. The England winger has been Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s No 1 target for months, but United are unwilling to match Dortmund’s £108million valuation.

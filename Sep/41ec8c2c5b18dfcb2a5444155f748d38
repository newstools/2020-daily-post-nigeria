The Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, has called for the protection of members of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), that would be used as ad-hoc staff during the governorship polls in Edo State on September 19. The monarch made the call on Thursday, when the NYSC Director-General, Brig Gen. Shuaibu Ibrahim, paid him a visit. He promised to join forces with NYSC, to ensure full protection of Corps members who will be participating in the election. “There is a need for the Corps members to be protected because of the desperate attitude of some politicians. “Desperate aspiration of politicians is not worth the blood of any corps member; they must be protected from any attack”, the Oba said. In response, Ibrahim noted that the Corps members are not partisan, but only discharging their patriotic duties to their fatherland. He also confirmed the NYSC was closely working with the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, ahead of the nation-wide reopening of orientation camps, in order to ensure a pandemic-free exercise.

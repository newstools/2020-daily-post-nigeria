Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has provided the latest team news update ahead of his side’s Carabao Cup fourth round tie against Brighton on Wednesday night. Solskjaer said he has no new injury worries ahead of Man United’s clash with Brighton and also hinted he would again utilize his squad in tonight’s clash. The Red Devils head to the game after defeating Brighton 3-2 in the Premier League last Saturday. “I’m not sure [if both teams will field very different line-ups to Saturday],” Solskjaer was quoted by Man United’s official website as saying. “Every game lives its own life and, of course at the stage, we are in the season with all the games coming up, I think teams are making changes. “You can see teams have a cup team and a league team, and we will make changes. It’ll be very similar to what happened last week against Luton. “It’s an opportunity for game-time. We need to build up the squad for a long season ahead and, of course, it’s an opportunity for individuals to impress. “At the stage, we are at. We need to have players ready and available because it’s a long season. But we have a strong and big squad.” He added: “No, [we don’t have any injuries from last game] not really. We’ve got a big week coming up with this cup game and Tottenham on Sunday, so eyes on both of them.” The match kick-off time is 7:45 pm at Amex Stadium.

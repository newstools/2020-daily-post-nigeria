Pastor Adewale Giwa, the leader of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry in Akure, Ondo State has urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to stop the repeat of the coronavirus test for travellers arriving in Nigeria. Giwa described the development as a scam and begged the Federal government to suspend it. The NCDC had announced that passengers wishing to travel to Nigeria must conduct another COVID-19 test. The cost of Covid-19 test ranges from N50,000 to N75,000. In a statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST on Tuesday, the cleric said president Buhari’s government had created another means of duping Nigerians through the NCDC. He said, “I urge President Muhammadu Buhari to consider the plight of people at this difficult time. It is senseless to ask travellers arriving in Nigeria to go through a test again when they must have come into the country with a valid COVID-19 PCR negative test result. “Are you saying Nigeria is better than the United States, United Kingdom or other advanced countries where travellers are coming from when they must have done everything perfectly? “They have created another avenue to get money from the people by force. “Please, someone should tell President Buhari and his men to stop this scam, enough is enough…the world is laughing at us.”

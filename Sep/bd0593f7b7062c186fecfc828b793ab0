Prophet T.B Joshua of the Synagogue Church of All Nations, SCOAN, has called on the government to gather COVID-19 patients in their different isolation centres for healing. Joshua said he wants to reach out to those in isolation centres for interactive prayers, while recounting how he had healed many in different countries. In a Facebook post, Joshua said, “The blessing of Jesus is for those who knock and ask (Matthew 7:7). “We want to encourage our communities, states, local and international bodies, medical doctors, scientists and the people in charge to organise those who are in isolation and let us arrange how to connect them to us on Emmanuel TV. “In whatever way you support to make this happen, we are a team; we are not doing more than you (1 Corinthians 3:8). In any way you need our service in transmission, we are at your service. “Together we shall pray for them. Together we shall be set free from this COVID-19. The same anointing that heals one is also able to heal all at the same time. “As the Scripture says, the people brought to Jesus all who had various kinds of sickness, and after the mass prayer, they were all healed (Luke 4:40).” The cleric on his Facebook page, shared numerous testimonies of COVID-19 patients who had recovered through his prayers.

Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has singled out striker, Harry Kane, for praise following his side’s Premier League 5-2 victory against Southampton on Sunday. Mourinho said Kane was incredible against Southampton, adding that he changed the game in the second half with his movement and link play. According to him, the England international allowed fellow teammate, Son Heung-min to play in a different position. Tottenham defeated Southampton at St. Mary’s Stadium, thanks to Harry Kane’s strike and four goals from Son Heung-min. Danny Ings did score two goals for Southampton. “In the second half, Harry Kane changed the game, his movement and link play was incredible,” Mourinho said at his post-match after the game. “He allowed Sonny to play in a different position.” Tottenham’s next Premier League match is against Newcastle United on September 27.

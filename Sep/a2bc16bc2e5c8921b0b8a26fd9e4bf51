The Police Command in Borno State has said it will not tolerate any form of protest. The spokesman, Edet Okon, gave the warning in a statement on Tuesday. The command said public demonstrations were capable of disrupting the “hard-earned peace in the state’’. Okon said that some groups were planning to protest against the hike in fuel price, electricity tariff, working conditions of state civil servants and N-power programme. “Such protest will not be condoned by the command as this may sabotage efforts of the Federal and State Governments and that of the security agencies to ensure that the emerging peace and security in the state is sustained. “The command is using this opportunity to remind members of the public that there is a ban on public rallies and all forms of procession in the state, and this ban, at the moment still subsist.” The command advised that all forms of grievances be addressed to relevant authorities. Okon noted that the organized labour via a press release on Monday disowned “any form of agitation/protest.” The police warned all prospective protesters to steer clear of Borno State and respect the laws of the land.

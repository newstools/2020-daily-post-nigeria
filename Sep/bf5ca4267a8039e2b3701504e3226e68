The Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, has asked God to let him lose Saturday’s governorship election “if it will cost the blood of anybody”. According to the governor, who will stand for re-election under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), his second term ambition is not worth spilling the blood of anyone. He made these remarks in a statement titled, ‘My reelection not worth spilling of blood – Obaseki’ and signed by his Special Assistant on Media, Crusoe Osagie. The Governor, whose major opponent is Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress (APC), urged eligible voters to come out en masse to vote, without fear of intimidation or harassment. “Election should not be one in which we shed blood because the election will always come. If you die in an election, you will not be there in the next one to vote. So, there is no need for violence. “There is no need for any violence and if anybody decides to act in a violent manner just walk away because our lives are very precious. I have a covenant with God; if it will cost the blood of anybody for me to get into power, he should not let me have power,” the statement read in parts.

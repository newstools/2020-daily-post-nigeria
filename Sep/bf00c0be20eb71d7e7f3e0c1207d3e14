Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has explained that he left William Saliba out of their 3-0 win over Fulham on Saturday, because he needs time to adapt to the Premier League. Alexandre Lacazette, Gabriel Magalhaes and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang were all on target for the Gunners at Craven Cottage. But there was no first start for Saliba, who signed for Arsenal from Saint Etienne last summer, before returning on loan to the Ligue 1 outfit for the season. Explaining why the French defender was left out entirely, Arteta told BT Sport: “I think it’s going to take him [Saliba] some time to adapt to our way of playing but as well to get adapted to the language, the rhythm, the physicality of the country. “As well we have to bear in mind that he didn’t play much football last season with all the injuries he had. “So, I think it will be a process that we have to be patient, picking the right games with the right environment and trying to grow because he [Saliba] has a really good potential.”

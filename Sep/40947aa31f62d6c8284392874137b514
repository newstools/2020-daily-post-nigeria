Former Real Madrid and Liverpool manager, Rafa Benitez, has warned Frank Lampard that he must deliver this season, after Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich approved over 200m so far on new players. Benitez knows all about being under pressure at Stamford Bridge, after managing the Blues for only six months. He arrived in November 2012, but went on to win the Europa League and finished third in the Premier League. Following a FIFA ban, Lampard has spent over £200 million on players like Kai Havertz, Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech, Ben Chilwell, Thiago Silva and Malang Sarr this summer, with more to come. Benitez has now made it clear that Abramovich wants instant success for all the money spent. “Now you can see Abramovich is back with his support and they have signed a lot of good players and will be very competitive. “This year, Chelsea and Manchester United must deliver. They have spent some money in recent years,” Benitez told SportsMail.

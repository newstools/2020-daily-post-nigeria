The Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF), Abubakar Malami (SAN), has said he will gladly testify before the Justice Ayo Salami-led Presidential panel against the suspended EFCC boss, Ibrahim Magu if he is summoned. Malami said this while answering questions on Arise TV on Wednesday morning. He was reacting to a letter written by the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, Ibrahim Magu, calling on Salami to summon the AGF. “If the Ayo Salami panel invites Abubakar Malami as a person or in the capacity of AGF for any testimony, for any clarification, for examination or cross-examination, Abubakar Malami will wholeheartedly, gladly within the spirit and context of the rule of law be there to testify within the context of the rule of law. “Our position as a government is to submit to the rule of law and the rule of law component of it requires that we appear when we are called upon to clarify issues, when we are called upon to be examined, when we are called upon to be cross-examined. “That indeed was an attribute of the government that translated to the victory we are seeing today arising from P&ID. “I have responded to uncountable requests for clarification of issues and indeed executed uncountable witness statements for the purpose of putting the record straight and the case of Salami will certainly not be an exception,” Malami said.

Abia State Government has denied reports that commercial tricycles (Keke) were last week banned plying major roads either in Aba or Umuahia. The State government in a statement by its Commissioner for Information, Abia State, Chief John Okiyi Kalu, said the government was seriously concerned about the unruly behavior of some Keke operators who have practically converted every road and street corner into illegal parking and loading areas thereby grossly impeding free flow of traffic. Kalu said the government was worried that about the continued flagrant disregard for traffic rules generally but not limited to operating without the necessary permits, driving against traffic, overloading, over-speeding, disregard for authorised traffic controllers etc, by the Keke operators. The Commissioner warned and directed leaders of the various Keke Unions in the state to immediately work with the Ministry of Transport to ensure that Keke parks and loading areas are identified and properly designated along major roads and streets. He urged them to ensure that there is total compliance with general traffic rules. “The various Unions are hereby given 2 weeks to ensure total compliance or risk drastic measures from the state government.” Kalu added that State Governor, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, PhD, was desirous of ensuring that all citizens get full value from the ongoing urban renewal initiative of his administration without any individual or group constituting an impediment to its full realization.

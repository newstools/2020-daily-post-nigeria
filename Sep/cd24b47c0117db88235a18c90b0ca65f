Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has confirmed Ben Chilwell and Thiago Silva will be involved in their EFL Cup match against Barnsley on Wednesday. Both players are part of the Blues’ summer spending spree, that has continued with the arrival of goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. The £22m deal for Mendy takes Lampard’s outlay in the window to £222m. Mendy could make his Chelsea debut for the game with West Brom this weekend, subject to passing the COVID-19 tests at Compton. “Thiago Silva is in the squad for tomorrow. He’s getting fit so I’ll make a decision on how many minutes he may get during the game depending on what’s best for him. “Ben Chilwell is also in the squad,” Lampard told a press conference on Tuesday. According to him, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic are also “getting closer” to returning to the line-up.

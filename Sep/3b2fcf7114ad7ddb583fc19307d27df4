The Federal government will meet with members of the organised Labour next Tuesday, to discuss the recent hike in the price of petrol and electricity tariffs. Speaking with reporters after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the State House, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, said the government would show its entire records of finance to the organised labour. According to Ngige, the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC), all institutions handling the finances of the government and their affiliates would be present at the meeting. “The invitation is going out to them this afternoon (yesterday) – to the Nigeria Labour Congress, the Trade Union Congress and their affiliates or supporters and friends in the civil society organisations. “At the meeting, government finances, challenges and everything will be laid bare on the table. Their own fears and what they think is also good for the Nigerian people, especially the workers, they will also table it so that we look at it,” he said.

Former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the reelection of Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State. Saraki on Sunday, while congratulating Obaseki and PDP, urged the Edo State Governor to use his next term to deliver on his promises to the people. In a statement posted on his Twitter page, he wrote: “I call on @GovernorObaseki to see his re-election as an opportunity to deliver on his campaign promises and to continually work to actualize the wishes and aspirations of the Edo people.” Saraki mentioned that the result of the just-concluded election also represents the fact that Nigerians desire to be governed by a truly democratic government headed by those they genuinely voted for. The statement read: “The result of the Edo governorship election represents the true wish of the people who stood firmly behind their Governor against power mongers who were determined to foist their choice on the people. It represents the will of the people to vote in free, fair and credible elections. “Edo election result is a victory for our country, her people and democracy. We have shown that the glory of the country is more valuable to the citizens than the wish of a tiny power clique.” Saraki commended Buhari for the free and fair election and keeping the military away from the electoral process. “We can see that the result represents realistic figures from one local government area to the other. No case of outlandish figures being reeled out. That is also a sign of some level of credibility in the process. “It is for the above reasons that I have to commend President Muhammadu Buhari for keeping the military out of this election and for giving the instructions that led to the apparent neutrality of INEC officials and other security officials involved in the entire process,” his statement added. Saraki further applauded the PDP leadership for accepting Obaseki into the party and supporting him.

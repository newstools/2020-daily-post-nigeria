Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State on Tuesday said he holds no grudge against suspended APC Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. Obaseki said this while receiving his certificate of return from the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC. The Edo Governor asked Oshiomhole to join him in building Edo State, adding that the fight is not over. “On a specific note, I want to use this occasion to remind the former National Chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole that the fight is not over, to come and join in building the house where he was part of laying the foundation. “We have no malice; the only thing we disagreed on is on the approach in moving Edo forward.’’ Governor Obaseki was re-elected on Sunday after scoring the highest number of votes and defeating his closest rival, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress (APC)

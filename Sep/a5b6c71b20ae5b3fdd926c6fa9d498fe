Laycon said: “I want to say congratulations guys, Vee, Neo, Dorathy, Nengi and I will like to say congratulations Laycon. “We are here now [finalists], when I came to this house. Obviously, I have no idea that I will be in the top five, just come here and spend two weeks. “I am very, very grateful. I don’t really know how to express how I feel with words or even emotions. “I just want to say I am grateful and thankful that I am here. I thank everyone who believed in me. “Thank you for being most accommodating because I know I am very annoying.” Watch the video below.

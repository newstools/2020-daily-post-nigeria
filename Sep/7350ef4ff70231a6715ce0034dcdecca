Oyo Governor, Seyi Makinde, says opposition politicians in the state have nothing to offer. The All Progressives Congress (APC) is the major rival to his platform, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Makinde spoke on Wednesday after kicking off the second phase of the N28.3billion Light-Up Oyo Project in Ogbomoso town. The project will cover over 223 kilometres of roads across all the zones of the state, The governor said the same politicians who have been posturing about 2023 were rejected by the people in 2019. He accused the opposition of trying to distract him with talks about 2023. Makinde stated that even if he decides not to seek re-election, Oyo will not fall into the hands of charlatans anymore. “Let me sound this: if I will not seek re-election, I am sure that Oyo State will never, again, be in the hands of charlatans. So, calm down. It is even too early to start talking about a second term. Some parties that do not have even one councilor are saying that they will send me out of the Government House in 2023,” he said. Makinde also kicked-off the construction of the 3-kilometre Under-G-LAUTECH Road.

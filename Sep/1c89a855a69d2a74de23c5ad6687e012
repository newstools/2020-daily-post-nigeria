Evicted Big Brother Naija housemate, Ozo, has denied claims that Kiddwaya’s friendship was a threat to his relationship with Nengi. Ozo told Ebuka on Monday that he had a conversation with Kiddwaya and he warned him to be careful. This was because of the second strike he received after writing a love letter to Nengi. “I had a conversation with Kiddwaya and I said his carefree personality was something I didn’t like. “He even advised me not to get a third strike after I got my second one.” When asked of his plans for the future, Ozo said will pursue his career in sport administration development.

President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday told the international community that Nigeria was still battling Boko Haram and bandits. Buhari’s message was contained in his pre-recorded address to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). He urged countries to take a strong action against illicit flow of small arms and light weapons. “Nigeria remains deeply concerned over the illicit trade, transfer, and circulation of small arms and light weapons, particularly on the continent of Africa. In Nigeria, we are still facing violent extremism from the insurgency of Boko Haram and bandits,” he said. He noted that Nigeria counts on cooperation with neighbours and UN counter-terrorism bodies to overcome terrorists in the Lake Chad Basin and the wider Sahel Region. The President said his administration will sustain the rehabilitation, reconstruction and resettlement of victims of terrorism and insurgency in the North-East. On COVID-19, the Nigerian leader added his voice to supply of safe and effective coronavirus vaccines for all.

The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) of Federal Polytechnic Mubi has described its immediate past Rector, Dr Sadiq Yahya, as a tyrant, who should be prosecuted. The union members who gathered in a protest at the Yola campus of the institution on Friday, also called on the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to investigate Dr. Sadiq for gross misconducts while in office. Holding placards and chanting their slogans, the ASUP members accused the former rector of witch-hunting and of disengaging staff without following due process. Chairman of ASUP, Husaini James, also accused the immediate past rector of mismanagement of the institution’s funds, among other specific allegations. “For over three months now, Dr. Yahya did not show up in the school since his tenure has expired but only for him to attempt to handover affairs of the school to the Deputy Rector in his house in Song yesterday which the deputy refused and he shifted it to this morning. “Because he got wind of us (ASUP) members are aware he wanted to handover today, he hurriedly handed over to the Deputy Rector about 10pm in Yola campus of the school without the Registrar of the school and other management staff of the institution. “The outgoing Rector made himself a tyrant whose words must be obeyed be it right or wrong,” the ASUP chairman told newsmen. He called on the Federal Government to investigate the activities of Dr Sadiq in the eight years that he functioned as the rector. Meanwhile, Dr Isyaku Abdulrahman, who deputised for Sadiq, has taken over as the Acting Rector. Sadiq whose tenure elapsed on Thursday, reportedly handed over to Abdulrahman Thursday night at the Yola campus of the polytechnic.

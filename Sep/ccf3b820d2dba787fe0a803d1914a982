Former Chelsea and Liverpool striker, Fernando Torres, has predicted the position the Blues, Reds and Manchester City will finish on the Premier League table this 2020/21 season. Liverpool won the Premier League title last season ahead of Pep Guardiola’s side (second position) and Chelsea (fourth position). But Torres believes Jurgen Klopp’s side and Man City will still compete for the Premier League top two positions, while Chelsea will finish behind them, adding that Frank Lampard’s side is building a fantastic team for the future. “I think they are building a fantastic team, not just for this season, but for the future,” Torres told talkSPORT. “They are building a very interesting squad, but they’re young, and you can see Frank [Lampard] can manage a young team as he did last season in a brilliant way. “They will be close, but I don’t know if they can compete with Liverpool and Man City. “Hopefully, they can go for the Premier League right until the end. “I think Liverpool will still be stronger than Man City or Chelsea. In the next two or three years, the Premier League, again, will be the top league in the world. “The future stars are going there. It is an exciting moment for Premier League fans.”

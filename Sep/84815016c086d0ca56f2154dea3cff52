Barcelona are not ruling out a scenario, where Lionel Messi stays at the club and sees out the final year of his current deal, ESPN reports. The LaLiga giants believe Messi’s position is not because of doubts over their sporting project. But rather his desire for a new challenge, both on and off the pitch. Barca argued that Messi can seek that challenge from 2021 either at Camp Nou, where a new president and board of directors would have been elected, or elsewhere. Messi’s father, Jorge, met with the club’s senior officials on Wednesday and more talks are planned. But so far, the 33-year-old has been refusing to attend training sessions with new Barca manager Ronald Koeman this week. Messi has been heavily linked with a move to Manchester City to work with Pep Guardiola.

The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the hike in the price of petrol by the Nigerian Government. PDP warned that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government was pushing Nigerians to the wall. A statement by party’s spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the hike as an “arrogant display of insensitivity and total disregard to the demands of the citizens to effect an immediate downward review in the pump price of fuel.” In the statement entitled: ‘Fuel Hike: You Are Pushing Nigerians to the Wall, PDP Cautions Buhari,” the former ruling party stressed that the Buhari administration was anti-people. Ologbondiyan maintained that the current administration has further worsened the hardship of Nigerians through the latest hike in the price of petrol. The party stressed that the hike should be “rescinded immediately.” The statement reads partly: “It is clear that the APC administration is completely anti-people as displayed in its refusal to heed to the cries of suffering Nigerians, who have rejected the fuel price increase, and there is no way history can be kind to any President who subjected Nigerians to the economic anguish and pains they have been suffering in the last five years. “Again, we caution the Buhari Presidency and the APC not to continue to test the elasticity of the will of the people.”

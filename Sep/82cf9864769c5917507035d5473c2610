Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, has condemned the increase in the price of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) and electricity tariff. He advised President Muhammadu Buhari to raise Nigerians’ living standards and not the cost of essential. Adams, in a statement by on Thursday, said his administration was insensitive, especially at a time the world is still going through the COVID-19 pandemic. “The federal government has failed in its responsibilities to Nigerians. The hardship of these increments relating to transportation and electricity tariffs will for a long time affect the people of this country. “This is not the kind of change we expected from a government that rode to power on Nigerians’ hope. Rather than cushion the effect of this outrageous increase, the federal government decided to look the other way. How will an ordinary citizen cope?” Adams told the government to stop policies capable of destroying the people’s trust. He appealed to President Buhari and the National Assembly to reverse the latest increments in the interest of the masses.

Big Brother Naija housemate, Ozo has said Kiddwaya’s eviction has changed him. Kiddwaya was evicted from the lockdown house after he got poor votes from viewers. His eviction came as a shock to Nigerians and celebrities. But Ozo speaking to Neo and Trikytee on Sunday night said Kiddwaya’s eviction gave him a hard reset about his reason for being in the house. According to him, all housemates thought he was going to be evicted and that has made him to have a rethink about his decisions in the house. Ozo said: “Kiddwaya’s eviction before me gave me a hard reset despite my week of infringement and strike. “Now I’ve decided to be focused for these two weeks and stay on my lane.” Ozo in the past few days had been distracted and had been concerned about his feelings for Nengi. His behavior earned him a second strike and a fine for microphone infringement.

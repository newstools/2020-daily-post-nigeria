The federal government has informed international travelers to obtain their COVID-19 results before flying in or out of Nigeria. Minister of Aviation, Hadi Sirika, spoke on Thursday at the daily briefing of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 in Abuja. Sirika assured that all preparations have been completed. He said passengers must register online, pay for COVID-19 test fee and upload the negative result not older than 72 hours before boarding. The minister reiterated that airlines would be fined $3,500 per passenger without the result. In addition, such a traveler will be turned back if he or she was a foreigner. The government is acting on the principle of reciprocity, meaning planes from countries that banned flights from Nigeria will not enter the country. International flights resume on September 5.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija Lockdown housemates, Nengi and Ozo were on Friday issued a fine by Biggie. Nengi and Ozo were fined for microphone infringements! The BBNaija housemates were guilty of whispering to each other. Whispering and having secret codes is against the rules of BBNaija season 5 reality show. Biggie announced that the fine will attract a deduction from her wallet. The other Housemates are not happy about the new fines as this could lead to losing their weekâ€™s wager task.

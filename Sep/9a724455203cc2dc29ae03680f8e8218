Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has insisted that his side signed goalkeeper, Eduoard Mendy from Rennes in order for the Senegalese international to provide competition for the Blues first-choice keeper, Kepa at Stamford Bridge. Mendy underwent his Chelsea medicals on Tuesday. Chelsea and Rennes have agreed a £27.96m fee for Mendy, after weeks of negotiations. Speaking ahead of Chelsea’s EFL Cup match against Barnsley on Wednesday, Lampard said at his pre-match press conference: “I don’t know what benefits in the long run, football is in your hands. “Competition is a regular thing. We have brought Mendy in for that competition. It’s in everyone’s hands to get into the squad.”

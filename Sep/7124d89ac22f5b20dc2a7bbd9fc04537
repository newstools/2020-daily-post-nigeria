The Nigerian Oscar Selection Committee (NOSC) has called for feature film entries by Nollywood filmmakers into the 93rd Academy Awards (2021 Oscars). The awards recently opened entries to honour the best new films released globally. The event will be held on April 25, 2021. NOSC chairperson, Chineze Anyaene, said the country’s first submission in 2019 represented a pivotal moment for the industry. Genevieve Nnaji’s movie, Lionheart was nominated for the 2020 Oscars in the Best International Feature Film category. Anyaene noted that the awareness the debut brought to Nigeria and Nollywood has been amazing. “It has opened the industry to other markets, and we hope to see partnerships with other industries soon.” For this edition, countries where selected films planned theatrical release but availed through a reputable commercial streaming distribution service or video on demand qualify for awards consideration. The new rules observed government protocols to manage coronavirus spread. Anyaene said: “Filmmakers have to provide to the Academy documentation (original document(s) and an English translation) of government-mandated theater/cinema closure dates, previously planned theatrical release and steaming distribution or video on demand agreements.” Also, eligible films have to be made available on the secure Academy Screening Room member site within 60 days of the film official selection. However, films that, in any version, receive a nontheatrical public exhibition or distribution before their first qualifying release will not be eligible for consideration. NOSC members are Mahmood Ali-Balogun (Vice-Chairperson), Adetokunbo Odubawo, Bruce Ayonote, Charles Novia, Ego Boyo, Mildred Okwo, Moses Babatope, Omoni Oboli, Shuaibu Husseini, Victor Okhai and Yibo Koko.

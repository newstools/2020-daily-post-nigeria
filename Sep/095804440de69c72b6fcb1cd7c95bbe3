Chief Sunny Onuesoke, a Chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Tuesday warned Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, not to enslave the people of Edo State like he allegedly did in Lagos State. Onuesoke, a former governorship aspirant in Delta State, issued the warning while berating Tinubu for asking people of Edo State to reject the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki. Tinubu had asked people of the state to vote against Obaseki, who is the governorship candidate of the PDP during the Saturday’s election. Faulting the remark of the former Lagos State governor, Onuesoke stressed that Tinubu wants people of the state to suffer from poor leadership. The former governorship aspirant spoke at the PDP Campaign Office in Benin, Edo state. He said: “Tinubu should know that Edo state is not Lagos state where he has succeeded in enslaving the conscience of the people and used his once highly position to intimidate and allow tyranny reign. “I hereby call on the good people of Edo State to shun Ahmed Tinubu and his call and stand with good governance which the duo of Obaseki and Shuaibu will provide if re-elected back to the Dennis Osadebey House for another term of four years.”

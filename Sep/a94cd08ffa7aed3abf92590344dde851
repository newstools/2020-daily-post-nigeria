The federal government has announced increased security measures for Nigeria’s 60th Independence Anniversary celebration. Ahead of the October 1 event, security has been enhanced in and around the venue – Eagle Square in Abuja. Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, made the announcement in a statement Tuesday night. He noted that from midnight on Wednesday, all routes leading to the Eagle Square will be blocked. The Shehu Shagari Way, Ahmadu Bello Way, outward and inward-bound Airport and adjoining roads will also be shut to traffic. Additionally, the Federal Secretariat will be evacuated by 2.00 pm on Wednesday. “This means all workers within the precinct of the Eagle Square are expected to vacate their offices from that time”, Mohammed said. The government had declared Thursday a public holiday in commemoration of the Diamond Jubilee.

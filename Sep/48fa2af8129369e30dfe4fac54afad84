The Delta State’s Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education has disclosed that it hasn’t released a new academic calendar for the 2020/21 session. Mr Patrick Ukah, the Commissioner, made the clarification in a statement in Asaba on Friday. Ukah urged parents and guardians to disregard the 2020/21 academic calendar circulating on social media, reportedly emanating from the ministry. According to him, the ministry had not taken a decision on the 2020-21 academic calendar. He said: “The resumption was preparatory to the Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) organised by the Ministry of Basic and Secondary Education scheduled to begin on Monday, September 21, 2020. “I wondered why mischief-makers would sit down and concoct false information that could mislead unsuspecting parents and guardians. “Once a final decision is taken on the matter, an official statement from the ministry would be made public.”

The federal government has assured that the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) would soon end. Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige, spoke on Channels Television’s Politics Today. He disclosed that the Ministries of Finance, Education, Labour and Employment and the Office of the Accountant General will meet with the union. “The issue of ASUU will soon come to an end. Two reasons – ASUU have called the Federal Government represented by Finance and the Accountant-General Office and their direct employers, the Ministry of Education to come for the test”, Ngige said. The nationwide industrial action started in March. ASUU top officials have repeatedly stated that the strike is still in force. The body wants implementation of the 2012 agreement. ASUU is also against government’s insistence that all lecturers must enrol on the Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System (IPPIS).

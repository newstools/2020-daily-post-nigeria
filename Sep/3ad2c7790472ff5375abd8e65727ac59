Akin Doherty, Lagos State Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has congratulated Edo Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on his reelection. He commended him for fighting hard and standing firm against godfatherism. In a statement on Monday, Doherty urged Lagosians to take part in the forthcoming legislative polls “to say no to godfatherism and the continuous stranglehold of Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu.” The Lagos East Senatorial District and the Kosofe Constituency II (House of Assembly) by-elections will hold on October 31. Doherty said the PDP victory in Edo proved that excesses of All Progressives Congress (APC) national leaders were “a fluke and a mirage”. “These excesses can be suppressed by the collective decisions and cooperation of the good people of Lagos State”, the PDP chairman noted. “We remind all and sundry that our freedom from the clutches of the APC can only be realized if we come out to vote in our candidates Mr Babatunde Gbadamosi and Hon. Ademola Alebiosu on the platform of the PDP. “Once again we congratulate the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki and the entire people of Edo State on this historical national victory against the oppressors of good governance,” he added.

Labour Party (LP) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to use the Edo governorship poll as a template for his administration’s electoral reform agenda. Julius Abure, LP National Secretary, gave the advice at a press briefing in Benin on Saturday. He told Buhari to ensure that the election was free, fair and credible. “There can never be democracy if electoral processes are not free, fair and credible. The president will not lose anything if the governorship election is credible. “We urged him to use this Edo governorship election as a basis for his government’s electoral reform agenda”, NAN quoted him as saying. The scribe described that electoral processes in Nigeria have been characterised by irregularities and frauds. “The president will write his name in gold if Edo governorship election is used to kick start the electoral reforms in the country,” he said. Isaiah Osifo, LP governorship candidate, charged the electorate to use their voter cards wisely. He appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies to ensure a credible exercise.

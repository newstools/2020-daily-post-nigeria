Newcastle United legend, Alan Shearer, has predicted the position Chelsea will finish this season in the English Premier League, EPL. Chelsea will begin their 2020/21 Premier League campaign against Brighton at the Amex Stadium on Monday night. Frank Lampard’s men finished fourth on the Premier League table last season. But Shearer expects Chelsea to improve on the fourth position they finished last season, insisting that he doesn’t think the Blues can win the Premier League title this term. Speaking on the position Chelsea will finish this season, Nevin told BBC Sport, “City aren’t the only team who will think they are capable of closing the gap on Liverpool. Chelsea have spent £200m already, so it’s clear what their intentions are. “Frank Lampard had a very positive first season in charge given the circumstances, with the club under a transfer embargo, but now they have splashed the cash, the expectation level changes. “Suddenly his target goes from hoping they can get in the top four, to a demand that they challenge for the title. You do not spend that sort of money otherwise but, while I’m sure they’ll improve, I still think winning the league will be beyond them.”

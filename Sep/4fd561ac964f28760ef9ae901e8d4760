Ibrahim Magu, suspended chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has denied collecting bribe from anybody. Magu dared anyone with evidence of his collecting bribe to publicly confront him before the Presidential panel investigating his activities as head of the EFCC. He was reacting to an allegation that he allowed a suspect, Hima Aboubakar, a Nigerien National, to escape justice. Speaking yesterday, the suspended EFCC Czar said anybody with evidence of him collecting bribe should “come out publicly to confront him before the Justice Ayo Salami panel”. Magu had opened his defense to the allegations of ‘Alleged Abuse of Office and Mismanagement of Federal Government Recovered Assets and Finances’ brought against him by the Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami. The suspended EFCC boss was represented by two of his lawyers, Wahab Shittu and Tosin Ojaomo. Magu is currently being probed for alleged mismanagement and insubordination while in office.

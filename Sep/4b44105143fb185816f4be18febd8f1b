Apex Yoruba socio-cultural organisation, Afenifere, has advised the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct free and fair elections in the forthcoming Ondo Governorship poll and other bye-elections in the south-west. Mr Yinka Odumakin, the National Publicity Secretary of Afenifere, gave the advice in an interview with NAN in Lagos on Wednesday. Odumakin, speaking on the group’s expectations from INEC in the forthcoming Ondo election and bye-elections in the geopolitical zone, said that only credible polls would deepen Nigeria’s democracy. He noted that INEC must improve on its assessment record with the forthcoming elections. “INEC should do its job well and ensure free and fair polls. INEC should improve its Curriculum Vitae (CV) with the forthcoming elections. “I want to see INEC be able to conduct elections that all parties will be satisfied with and give them kudos over,” Odumakin said. Odumakin also urged INEC to give a level playing ground to all candidates across the states to reposition the electoral system in the nation. Meanwhile, INEC has continued to receive praises from various quarters over the conduct of the Edo State governorship election which last Saturday.

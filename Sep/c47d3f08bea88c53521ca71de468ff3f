President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokesperson, Garba Shehu, has told Nigerians that petrol was sold for N600/litre under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration. Shehu tweeted this alongside the front page of a newspaper from Easter Sunday in 2013, in response to PDP claiming citizens may not survive the increment in electricity tariffs and price of petrol. PDP explained that the level of poverty in Nigeria was too high. However, Shehu wrote: “Don’t allow the PDP to deceive you. Amidst acute shortages, they sold petrol at N600 per litre on Easter Sunday in 2013 (See Punch published on that day).” The federal government through the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC), recently increased the ex-depot price of petrol from N138.62 to N151.56 per litre. Petrol marketers subsequently increased the price of the product from N148 to between N158 and N162 per litre.

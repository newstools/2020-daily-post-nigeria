A 43-year-old man identified as Abdul Baka has allegedly defiled and infected a 16-year-old girl with HIV in Karlahi, a rural community in Fufore Local Government Area of Adamawa State. The rights activist, Alhaji Hussaini Bello, who is pursuing the matter, described Baka as a serial rapist who had been abusing the teenager sexually with promise of marriage. Hussaini told newsmen that Baki had been sleeping with the girl in the pretence of getting married to her and the relationship has had the girl aborting three pregnancies beginning from when she was 13 years old. He said the matter was brought to him by some concerned people in Karlahi, complaining that Baki was destroying the future of the teenager. Hussaini said, “The case on my desk is so pathetic to the hearing of any good Nigerian. This man had defiled the innocent girl since she was thirteen, and ended up giving her HIV and three abortions were carried out on her. ”Our organization took her to Specialist Hospital in Yola for cross-examination and the doctor confirmed to us that (the girl) is HIV positive.” He added that he had forwarded the case to the Adamawa State Police Command with an eye on them to do justice, even as he expressed the reservation that Baki “is being supported by a particular politician who wants to bail him out.”

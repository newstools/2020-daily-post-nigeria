Barcelona has agreed on a €25 million fee with Ajax for Sergino Dest, Goal reports. The LaLiga giants are optimistic of wrapping up a deal for the American defender quickly. Barca has been working hard to offload as many players that are not part of Ronald Koeman’s plans as possible, with the club needing cash to finance the Dutchman’s rebuild. The club has so far raised €34million through sales, with Nelson Semedo having left for Wolves, Jorge Cuenca to Villarreal, Ivan Rakitic to Sevilla and Arturo Vidal to Inter. That number could rise by an additional €24m through add-ons. With the money they have, Barca can now afford to move for 19-year-old right-back Dest, who will cost the club €20m upfront plus an additional €5m in bonuses. Barcelona is also hopeful of selling Martin Braithwaite, Samuel Umtiti, Jean-Clair Todibo, Rafinha and Junior Firpo.

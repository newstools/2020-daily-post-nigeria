The Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, has lamented his failed efforts to reconcile the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki and his predecessor, Adams Oshiomhole. The monarch recalled the good relationship that existed between Obaseki and Oshiomhole. Oba of Benin, Ewuare II, spoke at a peace meeting with political actors at his palace in Edo State on September 2, 2020. The royal father said he had known the incumbent Governor since he (the Oba) was serving as an ambassador. Oba Ewuare II said he cannot tell what went wrong that led to the fierce face off between the two politicians. Ewuare II said, “I was very sad, shocked; what I thought was going to be a smooth ride for everybody, tranquillity in the state, tranquillity in the kingdom, turned to unprecedented conflict. “I could not believe it that I tried to intervene several times; I even went to the President about their matter.” Oba Ewuare II lamented that he had put in several efforts to reconcile the two politicians stressing that he sought “the intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari at some point in the matter.” The monarch noted that the fight between the two elephants was already having negative effects on the State and its people.

President Muhammadu Buhari has charged his aides, ministers and top officials to victoriously defend his government. Buhari said they should defend his government against those he described as irresponsible and politically-motivated activists spreading falsehoods about his government. The president charged his appointees to make public the achievements of his administration. He gave the charge during his closing remark at the first year ministerial review retreat at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Tuesday and was contained in a statement sent to DAILY POST by the Presidency. According to Buhari: “I have to charge all of you to defend the Government vigorously and not allow irresponsible and politically motivated activists to keep spreading patent falsehoods about this government. “Information to the public should be better packaged. Go on the offensive. “We are proud of our achievements and we should blow our own trumpets.”

The Anambra State Police Command has launched a manhunt for killers of Chukwuma Ojukwu, an aspirant to the Awka-Etiti traditional stool, in Idemili South LGA. Haruna Mohammed, the spokesman, disclosed this to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Thursday. Mohammed assured that the command will arrest the perpetrators. “The case is under investigation to ascertain circumstances surrounding the incident and bring fleeing perpetrators to justice,” he said. Chukwuma was the son of the late monarch of Awka-Etiti, Igwe Akum Ojukwu. He had insisted on replacing his father, noting that the throne was hereditary. On September 8, assailants stormed his residence in a bus and allegedly clubbed him to death. Chukwuma reportedly lived alone in the palace even after the mother and siblings left.

Shehu Sani, a former federal lawmaker, has reacted to the recent statement by the Minister of Health, directing federal hospitals to replace doctors with corps members. The Health Minister, lamenting the strike action by resident doctors directed the CMDs and MDs of all federal tertiary hospitals to replace the doctors in their hospitals with consultants and doctors on the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC. Ehanire said the strike commenced by the doctors at a time when the country was battling the COVID-19 pandemic was ill-timed. Reacting, Sani on his Twitter page said the replacement of striking doctors with corps members is impracticable and absurd. He told the government to rather meet the demands of the doctors, adding that not every Nigerian can afford medical tourism abroad. His tweet read: “It’s absurd and impracticable for the Minister of Health to direct public hospitals to replace striking Doctors with Youth Corps members. “The Government should concede to the demands of the Doctors. Not every Nigerian can afford medical tourism to Europe or Asia.”

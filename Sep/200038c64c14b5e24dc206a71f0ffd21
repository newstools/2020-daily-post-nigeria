A fake soldier has been shot dead by men of the Ogun State Police Command, during a robbery operation. Police said the fake soldier, who was described as an armed robbery suspect, was killed in the early hours of Friday, as he and his team engaged the police in a gun duel along Sagamu/Benin highway. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. Oyeyemi, in a statement, said, “The robber was shot dead following a distress call received by the police in Ijebu-Ife at about 2:45 am, that a gang of armed robbers in military camouflage, had blocked the expressway and were dispossessing motorists of their valuables.” Upon the information, Oyeyemi informed that the DPO of Ijebu-Ife, CSP Raphael Ugbenyo, quickly mobilised his anti-robbery team as well as a team of the Special Anti Robbery Squad (SARS) to the scene. “Sighting the policemen, the robbers engaged them in gun battle which lasted for about 30 minutes. At the end of the encounter, one of the hoodlums was shot dead while others escaped into the nearby bush with various degrees of gunshot injuries,” Oyeyemi said. According to the PPRO, two mock guns, a cell phone, assorted charms and a torchlight were the items recovered from the scene of the incident. DAILY POST gathered that “the corpse of the dead robber has been deposited in the mortuary, while effort is on to apprehend the fleeing members of the gang.” The Ogun State Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, while commending his men for their gallantry, directed the thorough combing of the entire area so as to bring the escaped members of the gang to justice. Ajogun also appealed to the general public, especially hospitals, to alert the police if anyone with bullet injury is seen in their area. He warned criminals to stay away from Ogun State, threatening that the command is ready more than ever to take the battle to their doorsteps.

The Director of Finance and Account in the Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs, Moses Chimereze Okpo, is dead. Ani Ekong, spokesperson to the Minister, Godswill Akpabio, confirmed the death to Tribune on Tuesday. He disclosed that Akpabio paid a condolence visit to the family on Monday. Ekong dismissed speculations that Okpo died of COVID-19. The media aide said the director had been sick even before the pandemic era. “There’s been misinformation. People think that he was the Director that died in NDDC some months ago of COVID-19 and buried last week. I learnt he’s been very sick for a long time for over a year before he passed on,” he said. Okpo served in the Offices of the Auditor-General, Accountant-General, Budget Office, and Head of Civil Service. Others were Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission, Ministries of Petroleum Resources and Transport, respectively. The native of Abia State was born on March 6, 1961. In May, Finance Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Ibanga Bassey Etang, died. The NDDC announced that he died from coronavirus.

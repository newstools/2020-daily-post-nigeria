The Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress and a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Obadiah Mailafiya, on Monday, again honoured the invitation by the Department of State Services (DSS). Mailafiya said if because he spoke about the plight of innocent citizens, he will perish, so be it. He said “I’m the voice of the holy martyrs, and if I perish, I perish”. DAILY POST recalls that it is the third time that the DSS is inviting Mr. Mailafiya over comments he made on radio, concerning Boko Haram. Mailafiya had alleged that a repentant bandit told him that a serving northern governor was a commander of the terrorist group. Speaking to journalists before he entered the DSS headquarters in Jos, Mailafiya who arrived at 11:09 hours, said, “I’m the voice of millions of voiceless people.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-839541" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200914_110510.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1920" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200914_110510.jpg 2560w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200914_110510-300x225.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200914_110510-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200914_110510-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/IMG_20200914_110510-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"> “Both Muslim and Christian youths have taken me as their voice.” “Thousands of people have been killed in this country; in Borno, Yobe, Adamawa, Katsina, Zamfara, Niger, Birnin Gwari, Southern Kaduna, Benue, Plateau and other parts of the country”, he decried. He maintained that, “I’m the voice of the holy martyrs and if I perish, I perish”. DAILY POST also recalls that the State High Court sitting in Jos, had last Friday fixed the 29th of September, 2020, for ruling on the application filed by Mailafiya. The former CBN Deputy Governor is challenging an invitation served on him by the office of the DIG Force Criminal Investigation Department, Abuja. Mailafiya is asking the Court to declare that the Department of State Security Services (DSS) is the only statutory body empowered by law to deal with crime against Internal Security of Nigeria.

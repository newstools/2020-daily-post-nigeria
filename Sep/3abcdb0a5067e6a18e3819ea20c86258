The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has warned against another COVID-19 explosion in the country, following deliberate refusal by some states to carry out adequate testing. NCDC’s Director-General, Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu, stated this while appearing on Arise TV. Ihekweazu noted that some states were unable to ascertain the number of COVID-19 cases in their domain. He, however, expressed delight that NCDC can establish that fewer cases were being reported than it was in the last six months, adding that he was especially impressed about the progress made in a few states, especially Lagos. The NCDC boss, however, said many states are not learning from others and so are not testing enough and not finding enough. “I am very worried that we might find an explosion in those states, which would then affect the rest of the country again,” Ihekweazu lamented.

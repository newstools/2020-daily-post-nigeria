The Commissioner of Police in Cross River State, CP Abdulkadir Jimoh, has deployed over 60 mobile policemen to the boundary between Cross River and Ebonyi States. The mobile policemen are to maintain peace and order in war-torn areas of Apiapum in Cross River State and Izzi in Ebonyi State that are currently engulfed by communal war over over land. Speaking with DAILY POST on Saturday, CP Jimoh regretted the communal clash between the two sister states and called for a ceasefire and return to negotiating table for lasting peace and love. He said though, he was not in the state (Cross River), he has deployed some top police officers in the rank of deputy commissioner of police to brief him on minutes by minutes of the situation at the war-torn area. The Commissioner, who said he could not ascertain the number of casualty so far, however, admitted that his men were yet to brief him on that but assured that peace and order would be maintained. Speaking further, the CP explained that other units of the force including anti-cultism and other tactical departments have also been deployed to the area to quell any unexpected. “We have deployed over 60 mobile policemen and others to the crisis-ridden areas with a view to maintaining peace and order. “The Deputy Commissioner of Police Operation has also been deployed to the area and he will be giving me minute-by-minute situation report,” the CP stated.

Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has told midfielder, Riqui Puig, that he can leave Camp Nou because he’s not part of his plans for the 2020/21 season, according to RAC1. Puig was keen to be officially promoted to Barcelona first-team for 2020-21, but his future now seems to be in serious doubt. The 21-year-old was not included in the Barcelona squad for Saturday’s Joan Gamper Trophy clash against Elche, and there has been no explanation from the Catalan club as to why he was excluded. Puig featured in Barcelona’s first two pre-season friendlies against Nastic and Girona and performed well. The Spanish youngster is now expected to either leave the Blaugrana on loan or on a permanent deal. Meanwhile, the arrival of Miralem Pjanic from Juventus this summer has reduced Riqui’s chances of first-team football under Koeman’s squad.

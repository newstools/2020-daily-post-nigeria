The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa on Friday urged the people of Ondo State to use their collective votes to end the administration of All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state. Giwa, while reacting to the hike in petroleum pump price and electricity tariffs under the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, said the people could only send the APC out of power through their votes. The clergyman stated this in a statement he forwarded to DAILY POST, on Friday. Giwa advised residents of Ondo State to “shine their eyes and use the hike in electricity tariffs, petrol pump price and APC’s bad governance to send governor Rotimi Akeredolu out of the Alagbaka government house.” He said,” I think no amount of words, protests could change this evil party, called the APC. They have come to destroy, kill and empty the nation’s treasury. “It’s just unfortunate that people don’t see beyond their nose(s). They don’t mean well for Nigeria, and only those who have conscience among them can do the right thing. “Governorship elections are coming in Edo and Ondo States, I hope people won’t exchange their votes for money, I hope they will vote according to their conscience. “I don’t know of Edo State, because I am not an Edo man, but I know of Ondo State that the governor is ready to destroy everything if re-elected. “Let me urge my people to shine their eyes and use this period to send governor Akeredolu back to Ibadan. “The only thing left for them now is rigging because people can now see clearly that they have been duped.”

The Adamawa State Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Bishop Stephen Mamza, has tested negative for COVID-19. He announced his clean bill of health Saturday, two weeks after he said he had tested positive and was going on isolation and for treatment. Bishop Mamza who is also the Catholic Bishop of Yola, reiterated during a press briefing at his residence in Yola on Saturday that he had been certified free by medical doctors. ”I have been certified free of coronavirus and I want to use this opportunity to thank very sincerely all people of goodwill across the country who have been praying for me in order that I get well and I want to assure everybody that I’m now physically well,” he said. He canvassed the need for citizens to continually adhere to the protocols laid down by the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to curb the spread of the virus. ”Coronavirus is real, there is no doubt about it and there is a need for the public to take the necessary precautionary measures, especially the protocols which include wearing of face mask, washing of hands with running water and maintaining social distancing,” he said. He, however, urged against attaching of fear to COVID-19, saying, “Yes, it is real, but I personally feel that the effect of coronavirus has been exaggerated in Nigeria and I think the fear that has been instilled into people is too much. It is not a death sentence and it is not as bad as people make it seem. If you get it, you will get well even if you have underlying sicknesses. Fear is the one that can paralyze someone.” He, however, called for improvements in healthcare delivery, saying it is only God that is helping to reduce the effects of coronavirus across the country. “I think COVID-19 has exposed our weaknesses in terms of health facilities in Nigeria. Our bad sides have been seen, and we have a lot to learn and also improve,” he said.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has claimed that they may be able to catch up with Liverpool and Manchester City this season, because he has added top personalities to his squad. The Red Devils begin their Premier League season against Crystal Palace at home on Saturday. Solskjaer will be looking to improve on a third-place finish last season. However, Donny van de Beek is the only summer arrival, although Solskjaer believes the squad has been further boosted by the return from loan of Dean Henderson, Pogba and Bailly’s return from injury and the January arrival of Bruno Fernandes. “We need to start the league well and we have to be consistent and I don’t want to take anything away from this group because we’ve added some top personalities. “We’ve got Dean [Henderson] in, we’ve got Donny [van de Beek] in, Paul [Pogba]’s fit now, Bruno [Fernandes]’s first game was in February so he hasn’t been here long. Eric Bailly has come back and is fit, and is looking really good. “So we hope that we can move forward and who’s to say that we can’t?” Solskjaer told reporters.

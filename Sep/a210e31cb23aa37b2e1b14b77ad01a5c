People Democratic Party (PDP)’s Youths in Northern Cross River State have condemned the brutal murder of their delegate, Charles Onwe in Yala local government area of the state. Addressing a press conference in Calabar on Tuesday, the Secretary of the group, Mr Ajegi John Ikachi, regretted that nearly one month after the primary election that was characterized by unprecedented violence which left some party faithful dead, maimed and traumatized, the leadership has not thought it necessary to invite those directly or indirectly affected. “A word of condolence has, up till now not gone out to the family of Charles Onwe. This is not in the character of our dear party, the PDP which has always acted as a family. Instead, we find a group of young people, leaders of tomorrow as they call themselves allowed to be used in a hurry to come and add insult to injury by telling lies to the public and covering the whole truth that happened” the youths lamented. The youths are, however, demanding that the family of the deceased be compensated adding that they have been living in penury since the death of their breadwinner.

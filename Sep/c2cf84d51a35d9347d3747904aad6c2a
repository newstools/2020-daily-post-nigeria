Mr Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), has commended the decision of labour leaders to suspend their planned nationwide strike scheduled to have commenced on Monday. DAILY POST reports that the NLC and TUC on Monday morning agreed to suspend the strike after an agreement was reached with the Federal Government. Labour had called for the strike against the recent hike in petrol and electricity price across the country. Kyari, in a post on his official Twitter handle on Monday, praised the leadership of the unions for choosing the pursuit of common good. His tweet read: ”Being a former union leader, I understand the difficulties of labour leadership when faced with choices between stark realities and legitimate follower expectations. “The leadership chose the pursuit of common good and posterity will vindicate us all for standing with our country.” According to him, the Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) had by their action demonstrated absolute faith in Nigeria. “They showed understanding on inevitability of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) deregulation and jointly charted way forward to secure local refining sufficiency through greater stakeholder inclusiveness and transparency. “We will follow through diligently,” he added.

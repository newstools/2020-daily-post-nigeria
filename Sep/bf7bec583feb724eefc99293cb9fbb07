Lazio sporting director, Igli Tare, is expecting Manchester United midfielder, Andreas Pereira, to leave Old Trafford in the next three days for the Serie A side. This was revealed by respected Italian sports journalist, Fabrizio Romano, via his Twitter account on Monday night. Romano tweeted, “Lazio sport director Igli Tare: ‘We expect Andreas Pereira deal to be completed in the next 2-3 days with Man United.'” “Lazio manager Inzaghi: ‘I like Pereira so much, He’d be perfect for us.’ “Last details still to be completed about his salary with MUFC. The agreement is close.” Pereira has not featured for Man United in the Premier League so far this season. The 24-year-old missed Man United’s matches against Crystal Palace and Brighton respectively. The Brazilian faces completions from Donny van de Beek, Scott McTominay, Paul Pogba and Nemanja Matic under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad.<img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-844005" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/romano-tweet.jpg" alt="" width="592" height="298" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/romano-tweet.jpg 592w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/romano-tweet-300x151.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/romano-tweet-590x298.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 592px) 100vw, 592px">

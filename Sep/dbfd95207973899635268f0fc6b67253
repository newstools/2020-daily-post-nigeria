Cardinal John Onaiyekan has urged the government at all levels to display zeal to ensure lasting peace in Nigeria. NAN reports that Onaiyekan gave the counsel while addressing participants at the 2020 Cardinal Onaiyekan Foundation for Peace (COFP) event in Abuja on Tuesday. The cleric advised religious leaders to preach against fanaticism and extremism. Onaiyekan expressed concern about corruption, bad governance, insurgency, killings, and other problems bedevilling Nigeria. “In a world where extreme religious views and ideologies are used to justify violence, crimes and insurgency, the roles that religious leaders can play in countering such views, ideologies and foster unity, understanding, mutual respect and cooperation cannot be overestimated. “Above all, I believe that lasting peace is possible when our governments show more commitment in addressing issues of social injustice,’’ he said. Onaiyekan said he was convinced that interfaith cooperation and partnership were essential in advancing inclusive society. He added that peace can only be achieved when Nigerians understand, respect and accept differences.

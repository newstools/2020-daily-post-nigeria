Popular Nigerian artiste, Rema has called out the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP over the death of his father, Justice Ikubor. Justice Ikubor before his death was a high-ranking member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State and former General Manager of the state-owned Ethiope Publishing Company. It was gathered that Rema’s father was reportedly found dead in a room at Bins Hotel in Benin City in 2008. His lifeless body was found alongside empty cans of energy drink. However, Rema in one of his tweets on his Twitter page on Monday said the PDP owes him an explanation of what happened to his father in that hotel room. Rema wrote: “PDP you all need to explain what happened to my father in that hotel room. “Justice Ikubor’s son has risen.” <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-843883" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed-5.jpg" alt="" width="292" height="360" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed-5.jpg 292w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/unnamed-5-243x300.jpg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 292px) 100vw, 292px">

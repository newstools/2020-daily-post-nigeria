Tottenham Hotspur forward, Gareth Bale, has said that he expects fellow new recruit, Sergio Reguilon, to bring his energetic and attacking style of football to Jose Mourinho’s side. Bale and Reguilon both played together for several years at Real Madrid. The duo joined Tottenham a few days ago from Real Madrid on loan and permanent deal, respectively. Speaking about Reguilon ahead of Tottenham’s Premier League clash with Southampton on Sunday afternoon, Bale was quoted by Metro UK as saying: “He’s an exciting young player. “I’ve been with him for a couple of years at Madrid, and obviously he did great last year for Sevilla in their season winning the Europa League. “So, yeah, he is an exciting young left-back, very energetic, loves attacking, great delivery. “So he is a great signing and a great addition to the squad, and I think everyone will enjoy watching him.”

Emiliano Martinez has confirmed his Arsenal exit in an emotional farewell to Arsenal fans. The Argentine goalkeeper is expected to join Aston Villa in a £20m move. Martinez’s stock increased after he starred for the Gunners post lockdown, in their run to FA Cup glory and the Community Shield victory over Liverpool. The 28-year-old has been at the club since 2010, but has largely been a deputy to other goalkeepers. He finally got his chance after Bernd Leno picked up an injury at the end of the 2019/2020 campaign. Martinez has decided to move on, with Leno returning and his place under threat again. “With my family I decided, 11 years at the club, 10 years worked so hard, I leave through the front door today. “For me I could not be happier to leave through the front door with the Arsenal fanbase supporting me and the club. “I’m very grateful for the 11 years at Arsenal, even if it was a hard road for me,” he said in a video posted on Instagram.

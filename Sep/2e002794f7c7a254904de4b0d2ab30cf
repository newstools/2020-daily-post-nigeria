The Niger State Police Command has called on members of the public in possession of illegal and prohibited firearms in the state to submit them between now and 30th September, 2020. The Command in a press statement signed by the Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, ASP. Wasiu A. Abiodun and sent to DAILY POST said that firearms such as single barrel, double barrel, automatic pump action and locally fabricated gun among others should be surrendered to a nearby Police Division, Area Command or State headquarters within the stipulated time. According to the command, the move is in line with Inspector General of Police initiative to curb proliferation of firearms and mop up illegal and prohibited firearms in circulation across the nation. Abiodun warned that failure to submit the arms by those in possession of them would result to lawful action. The statement said, ” At the expiration of this ultimatum, the Command shall commence aggressive firearms mop up exercise in the State and anyone found in possession of firearm without compliance to the aforementioned directive shall be arrested and prosecuted for unlawful possession of firearm.” It, however, warned the general public of the danger in arming group(s) of people in the guise of defending their communities. The command then encouraged the people to always partner and work closely with the Police and other security agencies with the aim of bringing crime to its barest minimum in the state.

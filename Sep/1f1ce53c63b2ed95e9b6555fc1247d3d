Deji Adeyanju, popular activist, on Monday, warned Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, against contesting for the presidency in 2023. Adeyanju warned that Tinubu’s political career would be over, if he contests the 2023 presidency. Mocking the former Lagos State governor, the convener of Concerned Nigerian group, however, said Tinubu should run for the presidency. In a tweet, the activist wrote: “I want Tinubu to contest the 2023 presidential election under APC. That will be the end of his political career.” This is coming at a time when Nigerians are saying the defeat APC suffered in the just concluded governorship election in Edo State. The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had defeated Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the APC after polling the highest votes. I want Tinubu to contest the 2023 presidential election under APC. That will be the end of his political career. — Comrade Deji Adeyanju (@adeyanjudeji) September 21, 2020

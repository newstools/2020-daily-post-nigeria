The federal government on Thursday gave an update on the reopening of schools across the country. National Coordinator of the Presidential Task force on COVID-19, Sani Aliyu, said reopening of schools must be staged. Aliyu disclosed this during the task force daily briefing in Abuja, on Thursday. “Reopening of schools in the country must be staged,” Aliyu said. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had ordered the closure of schools, following the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nigeria. The federal government, however, ordered exiting classes to return to school in order to take their final examinations.

Ajax selling Donny van de Beek to Manchester United could have major implications for Luis Suarez, according to Sport. Van de Beek is set for a £40million move to Old Trafford, after the Premier League side agreed the fee with Ajax. Ajax director of football, Marc Overmars, has now made a transfer promise to Barcelona’s Luis Suarez and vowed to use the cash to try and bring him back to the Dutch club. Overmars is hopeful the money they get from Van de Beek sale, can fund a move to bring back Suarez, who is out of favour at the Camp Nou. The Uruguay international played for Ajax before he left for Liverpool. Juventus are also keen on Suarez, who is now surplus to requirements at the LaLiga club.

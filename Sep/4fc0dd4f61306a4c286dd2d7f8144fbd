David Ibiyeomie, founder and General Overseer of Salvation Ministries has warned controversial Media personality, Daddy Freeze against abusing Bishop David Oyedepo. Daddy Freeze, who is popularly known for criticising Nigerian pastors, in his recent post on his Instagram page, attacked Bishop David Oyedepo of Winners Chapel for saying women should submit to their husbands. According to Daddy Freeze, Oyedepo’s advice is a misquote of the scriptures. Reacting, Pastor Ibiyeomie in a viral video from his Sunday service, blasted Daddy Freeze, warning him not to ever insult Oyedepo or talk about him. According to the Cleric, ‘he cannot be alive and watch someone insult his father, Oyedepo’. He said: “I can’t be alive and you insult my father. The day Daddy Freeze insults Oyedepo I will deal with him and arrest him. “Who gave birth to you? Do you have a father? Show us his picture. “Oyedepo will not talk but I can’t be alive and you insult my father. I curse the day you were born. “I will tear you into pieces you bastard. He is insulting him because he has no father. “You can never insult a father if you have one, be warned. A man whose wife left him, has no good job will be insulting my father and people will be laughing online. I will never be alive to see such and do nothing again.” Come get your Pastor 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️ pic.twitter.com/KGNeyCKcHj — Bizzle Osikoya (@bizzleosikoya) September 6, 2020

Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has advised the club to sign at least three or four more players this summer after completing Donny van de Beek transfer from Ajax earlier this month. Van de Beek became Man United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s first signing of the summer last week. Man United, who finished the third position on the Premier League table last season, have been linked with moves for the likes of Alex Telles, Jadon Sancho, Jack Grealish and Sergio Reguilon in the past. But Neville believes the Red Devils need to sign a left-back, a centre-back and a forward before the transfer window closes next month. “I think the left-back area is important because Luke [Shaw] has had injury problems,” Neville told Webby and O’Neill YouTube channel. “I think centre-back is critical and I do think at least one forward is important. I still think we need three or four signings. “I have got a feeling they [the Manchester United board] are on it and are just not getting them over the line quite as quickly as they would want.”

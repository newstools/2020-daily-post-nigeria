Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, was left fuming after his players celebrated Andreas Christensen’s red card, during their 2-0 win over Chelsea on Sunday. Christensen was dismissed shortly before half time, after he hauled down Sadio Mane, who was clean through on goal. Referee Paul Tierney had initially awarded a yellow card, but reversed his decision after looking at the pitch-side VAR monitor. As Christensen made his way off the pitch, Liverpool’s substitutes applauded the decision. An angry Klopp turned to his Liverpool players in the stands and said: “Are you crazy? We never, ever do that, okay?” Sadio Mane scored twice in the second half against the 10 men, to hand the champions victory. Chelsea had a chance to pull one back late in the game, but Jorginho saw his penalty saved by Alisson Becker.

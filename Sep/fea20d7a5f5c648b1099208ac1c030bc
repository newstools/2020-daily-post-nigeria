Wales head coach, Ryan Giggs, has revealed the age Portugal captain, Cristiano Ronaldo, will retire from football. Ronaldo on Tuesday scored his 101st international goal for Portugal in their 2-0 victory over Sweden at the age of 35. The Juventus forward is now just eight strikes shy of matching the record for most international goals in football history. But Giggs, who played alongside Ronaldo during their time at Manchester United, believes the forward can continue playing football until he’s 40. “I was at a top club [Manchester United] and played until I was 40, and I can see him [Cristiano Ronaldo] going on and playing until he’s 40 as well,” Giggs told the PA news agency. “He looks after himself, he eats right, rests right and lives for the game and is the best professional I ever played with. “I saw him at the start of his career, and you could never foresee him going on to score this amount of goals. “He was a talent and a brilliant player who excited you. Cristiano was always a student of the game, and just like me, he is always looking for that extra edge. “He was always in the gym and had it in his mind how good he could be. “He scored 40 goals in one season at United and since then what he’s done is remarkable.”

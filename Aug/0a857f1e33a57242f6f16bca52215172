Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Kiddwaya has given reasons why he voted for Vee to be evicted on Sunday. Kiddwaya was among the housemates who picked Vee and Praise to be evicted among the bottom four housemates. However, Vee got 5 votes which saved her and got Praise evicted from the reality show. When asked why he chose Vee, Kiddwaya during his diary session with Biggie said Vee is too attached to Neo and does not bond with other housemates. According to him, he feels like Vee has enough to offer but is limiting herself due to her relationship with Neo. Kiddwaya said: “I voted Vee because I feel she’s too attached to Neo and does not try to have conversations with other people “I would love to see Vee be more independent and I’m yet to see the best of her because I know she has a lot to offer “I feel she’s been booed up with Neo and not bonding enough with other people. She only talks in groups with other housemates.” “I’m always making the conscious effort to speak to her not the other way around.”

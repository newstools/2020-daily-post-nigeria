Manchester United have entered the race to sign Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho and are willing to offer the player’s club their asking price. Sancho is also wanted by Liverpool and Chelsea this summer transfer window. But Man United hold a significant advantage over their rivals after they submitted an opening offer of £89million to Dortmund for their winger last week which was rejected by the Bundesliga giants. Dortmund are holding out for a £109.3million transfer fee for Sancho. The German club has already told Red Devils to sign Sancho before August 10 as they want the 20-year-old’s future resolved before the start of their pre-season training camp in Switzerland later this month. Man United have seen their revenue streams hit hard because of the coronavirus pandemic and will have less money to spend this summer. According to Bild, Man United want to pay Dortmund €70million upfront for Sancho this summer and later pay another £30million in 2021, and then an extra €20million in 2022. Man United coach, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is keen to add Sancho to his squad this summer in a bid to bolster the right side of his attack after securing qualification for next season’s UEFA Champions League. Sancho has been a key part of Dortmund’s attack this season. The England youngster scored 20 goals and registered 20 assists in 44 appearances for Dortmund this season.

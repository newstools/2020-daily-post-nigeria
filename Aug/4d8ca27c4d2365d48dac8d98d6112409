Manchester City are so desperate to land Lionel Messi and will offer Barcelona three players plus €100million, according to Spanish newspaper, Sport. It is understood that the three players Man City will offer Barcelona to force the deal are: Bernardo Silva, Gabriel Jesus and Eric Garcia. Messi’s future at Barcelona is uncertain after the Argentine captain surprised Barcelona hierarchy on Tuesday night when he asked for his contract, which has one year still to run, to be terminated under an end-of-season release clause. The 33-year-old had drawn the interest of many European top clubs including Man City, Manchester United, Paris Saint-Germain, Inter Milan and Juventus in the past few days. Messi, who played under Man City boss, Pep Guardiola for four years at Camp Nou, is looking to trigger a clause in his contract that would allow him to leave the Blaugrana, but Barcelona are trying to get a fee for their number 10. Man City are now in pole position to land Messi, who increasingly looks set to end his 19-year stay in Spain.

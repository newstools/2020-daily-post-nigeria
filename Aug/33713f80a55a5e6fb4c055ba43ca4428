Paris St-Germain have qualified for their first-ever Champions League final, courtesy of a 3-0 win over RB Leipzig on Tuesday. The Ligue 1 champions took control of the tie in the first half, going into the break two goals up. First, Marquinhos headed in an Angel Di Maria free-kick, before Di Maria himself finished off a fine team move to make it 2-0. Although Leipzig started strongly after the interval, it was PSG who scored again through Juan Bernat. PSG will now play the winner of tomorrowâ€™s semi-final between Bayern Munich and Lyon for the trophy. The Champions League final will be played this Sunday, August 23.

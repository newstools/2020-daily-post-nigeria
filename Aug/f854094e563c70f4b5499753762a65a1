Speaking to Dorothy, Laycon said, “If I was actually watching this show from the outside, you’d be my favourite housemate. You, then Kidd.” Asked, “Why Kidd” by Dorothy, Laycon explained that “Kidd is nonchalant about everything and I like that kind of person. Regardless of whatever the fuck is happening, he’ll be like my second favourite housemate then Neo. “For you, [Dora] the sarcasm…that’s why when you lashed out last Sunday, I was surprised.”

The World Health Organisation (WHO) says COVID-19 virus has not been detected in breastmilk. The United Nations agency insisted it is unlikely that it can be transmitted through breastmilk. WHO Regional Office for Africa in Brazzaville, Congo, said this via its Twitter account @WHOAFRO. The 2020 World Breastfeeding Week runs from August 1 to 7. WHO explained that breastmilk reduces infant mortality and provides numerous health advantages. “Breastfeeding mothers can breastfeed their babies even if they are confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19,’’ it said. Tedros Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General of WHO, has also emphasised the importance of breastfeeding. “WHO recommends that mothers with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be encouraged to initiate or continue to breastfeed,” he noted. Ghebreyesus said mothers should be counselled that the many benefits of breastfeeding for newborn babies and children outweigh the potential risks for COVID-19 infection.

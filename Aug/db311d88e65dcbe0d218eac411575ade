A man confined in a room for about 30 years by his relatives has been rescued by the Police in Kano State. The Kano State Command of the Nigeria Police rescued the man held captive for about three decades on Thursday. The relatives allegedly locked up the 55-year-old man, whose name is yet to be known for having a psychiatric problem. The victim was tied to wood in a room with no window. Confirming the incident, the spokesman of the Kano Police Command, Abdullahi Haruna, said the victim has been admitted into a medical facility in Rogo Local Government and already an investigation has been launched into the matter.

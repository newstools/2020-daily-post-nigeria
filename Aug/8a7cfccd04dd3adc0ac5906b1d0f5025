A prominent Nigerian Pastor in Zimbabwe, Nixon Chibuzor Ohizu has been arrested for allegedly offering a $2,000 bribe to National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) officials. The 46-year-old head pastor of the Empowerment Ministries Church was accused of offering USD 2,000 to two high ranking NRZ officials to reverse the cancellation of a lease agreement between his church and the transport utility. Chibuzor had met Colonel Nyabambi and Clive Ncube at the NRZ office on August 7. The two NRZ officials reportedly accepted a bribe offer of $2,000 and agreed to reverse the cancellation on the lease agreement once he had delivered the agreed amount. Upon returning to the office not knowing that a trap has been set, the pastor was arrested by the police. The bribe money which was in $100 denominations was recovered by the police and is currently being kept as an exhibit. Pastor Ohizu was not asked to plead to the allegations when he appeared before Harare magistrate Richard Ramaboa. He was, however, granted bail of $10, 000 and was ordered to surrender his passport.

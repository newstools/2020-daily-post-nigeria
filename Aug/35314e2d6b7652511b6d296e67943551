Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., the National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has commended the Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS, for rising to the occasion in issuing the coup plotters in Mali just 12 months to return the country back to civilian rule. He, however, said that ECOWAS should be able to tell the junta the dire consequences of not relinquishing power in 12 months. ECOWAS authority took the decision at the end of its second virtual extraordinary session on the socio-political situations in Mali at the weekend. Bamgbose described this as a welcome development, adding that military rule is an aberration, odious, outdated and obnoxious. “It should no longer be tolerated in Africa,” he said in a chat with DAILY POST on Saturday. “The three years transition to civil rule, proposed by the military junta, is unacceptable and must be refused. “The 12 months ultimatum is in order and realistic. ECOWAS should not just bark but bite. They should be able to tell the junta the dire consequences of not relinquishing power in 12 months. “Those who make civilian rule impossible, should be made to know that, the use of force will be inevitable. “Civilian rule must return to Mali in 12 months that should not be something of probability, but possibility. The junta should put their house in order and vacate the seat of power in 12 months.”

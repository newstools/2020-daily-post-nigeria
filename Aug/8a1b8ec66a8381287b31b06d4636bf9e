Juventus, on Saturday, sacked their manager, Maurizio Sarri, after their exit from the Champions League at the hands of Lyon on Friday night. Juventus made the announcement in a statement via the club’s official website on Saturday. The Serie A giants were eliminated from the Champions League last-16 second leg tie on an away goal rule against Lyon after a 2-2 draw aggregate. Lyon won the first leg 1-0 in France back in February, while Juventus won the second leg 2-1 in Turin, thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo’s brace. The statement reads: “Juventus Football Club announces that Maurizio Sarri has been relieved of his post as coach of the First Team. “The club would like to thank the coach for writing a new page in Juventus history with the victory of the ninth consecutive Scudetto, the culmination of a personal journey that led him to climb all the categories of Italian football.” Meanwhile, It has been revealed that Juventus will pay Sarri €20million in compensation for sacking the Scudetto winner in a second year running, according to Football Italia. Sarri replaced Max Allegri, who was sacked last year despite becoming the first coach to secure five consecutive Serie A titles. The former Chelsea coach is tied down to Juventus until June 2022, earning a salary worth €5.5million per season. If the contract is not terminated by mutual consent early, then the Old Lady must pay €11million net in Sarri’s wages, which comes to €20.3million gross. Sarri’s whole staff were also sacked as part of the latest revolution in Juventus.

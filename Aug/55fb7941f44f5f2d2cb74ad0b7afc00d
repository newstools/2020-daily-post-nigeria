Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Wathoni has admitted she was attracted to Prince. She mentioned that Prince gave her the green light to be in a relationship but she resisted based on personal reasons. Wathoni said this while speaking to housemates in the room on Thursday afternoon. Wathoni said: “I would have been with prince but was not ready before he got together with Tolanibaj. “We would have been together, he gave me green light but reasons best known to me I left him.” Recall, Prince had interest in Nengi, Tolanibaj and Wathoni when he got into the house. However, he got rejected by Nengi and ended up with Tolanibaj.

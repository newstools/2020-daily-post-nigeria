The Federal Government has unveiled an alternative to using chemical fertilizer to Nigerian farmers. Minister of Agriculture and rural development, Muhammad Sabo Nanono disclosed this in his keynote address at the official flag-off of planting fertilizer tree (Gawo) in Garki local Government area of Jigawa state. He said using fertilizer trees in farms has been the traditional method used by farmers to increase soil fertility and productivity. The Minister, however, explained that if a farmer has fifteen fertilizer trees in his one hectare, it is sufficient for him without any additional chemical fertilizer in his farmland. “The introduction of “Faidherbia albida” fertilizer tree is a right step in improving the soil fertility without the use of chemical fertilizer ” he stated. Nanono said the development is part of series of government interventions across the country under the present administration to address the issues of climate change and degraded farmlands to make them to become more productive for enhanced food security and regeneration of the natural ecosystem. The minister, therefore, warned farmers against illegal cutting down of trees in the country which he said resulted in desertification and climate change. “In Niger Republic, no one is allowed to cut down a tree without permission, in Nigeria it is different, people cut down trees at any time they wish and this has a negative effect on our environment.” The Minister added. He, however, urged the traditional institution to support the government’s efforts in curtailing the menace of deforestation. Governor Badaru Abubakar said his administration will give more priority to the production of fertilizer tree seedlings. He noted that his administration will provide a law that will prohibit illegal cutting trees in the state.

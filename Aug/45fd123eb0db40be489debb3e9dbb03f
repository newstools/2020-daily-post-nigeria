An estranged political associate of President Muhammadu Buhari and the National Chairman of defunct Reformed All Progressives Congress, rAPC, Alhaji Buba Galadima, has said that the only achievement of the current administration is that they have finally stopped blaming the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, for the woes of the country. Galadima, who was one of the spokespersons of the PDP during the 2019 general election, said this while appearing on Channels Television’s Police Today, alongside President Buhari’s Special Assistant on Media, Aliyu Abdullahi. Abdullahi had earlier claimed that this administration has done credibly well, and no part of Nigeria is under the control of Boko Haram today. On the issue of insecurity, Galadima used Katsina State, the President’s home State where people are being killed and displaced on a daily basis by bandits as an example. Galadima said, “He [Abdullahi] is free to say that because we’re in democracy everybody has got their view and opinion about an issue. “But I don’t think our listeners in this country, [ I mean] anybody that is listening to this programme will agree with him or anyone else [on that.] Because the only achievement for me, the APC has done is that they have stopped the blame game. “[They have] stopped blaming the PDP for the woes of this country. That is the only achievement they have. But if you are talking about security, I don’t want to take you very far, go to the President’s home State of Katsina. “Today, in the newspapers, several people were killed, several others were displaced. That is his home state.”

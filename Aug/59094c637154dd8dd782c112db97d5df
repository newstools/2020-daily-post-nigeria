The Police Command in Adamawa State has complained of illegal use of its uniform. The command said vigilantes, civil groups and other quasi security outfits were using its uniform and this would not be condoned. “These groups impersonate our personnel through the use of our uniforms, accoutrement and logos, giving the police a bad image,” the command said. The command which stated its position in a press release signed by its Public Relations Officer, Suleiman Nguroje, said to guard against the practice, the command has established a taskforce to identify offenders and prosecute them. “The state Commissioner of Police, Olugbenga Adeyanju, enjoins the people of the state to support the taskforce as they commence the full enforcement of the rule of law,” the release said.

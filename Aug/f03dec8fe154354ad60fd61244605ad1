Benjamin Kalu, member representing Bende Federal Constituency and Spokesman of the House of Representatives, has lauded the sense of maturity exhibited by the Speaker, Abia State House of Assembly, Hon. Chinedum Orji, over his recent reconciliation with leaders of the opposition All Progressives Congress, APC, and the current Senate Majority Chief Whip, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu. The APC federal lawmaker, who spoke with newsmen, after a visit to the Speaker of the Abia House of Assembly, Chinedum Orji, in Umuahia, also commended the leadership of the Abia State House of Assembly on the work to advance democracy in the state. Ben Kalu, however, encouraged members in the State Assembly to remain undeterred and sustain their quest to bring dividends of democracy to the people. Recall that the Abia Speaker, and son of ex-Governor of the State, Chinedum Orji, had led a delegation consisting mainly of his Umuahia kinsmen to visit Senator Kalu at his Abuja residence shortly after the latterâ€™s release from prison over alleged fraud. The Speaker, who is a chieftain of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Abia, urged the opposition leader, Senator Kalu to return and take his rightful place in the governance of the state. Hon Orji, however, sued for peace and declared his loyalty to the Senate Majority Chief Whip. The action of the Assembly Speaker had continued to generate outbursts, mostly from leaders and Stakeholders of PDP, asking Chinedum Orji to resign over his open loyalty to Senator Orji Uzor Kalu, as he cannot continue to preside over the affairs of the PDP controlled House of Assembly while his loyalty remained with the opposition. But, the Speaker, in his reaction contained in a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Jude Chijioke Ndukwe, insisted that he owed nobody any explanation on his reconciliation with the leader of the opposition, Senator Kalu. He described agitators of his resignation as political jobbers.

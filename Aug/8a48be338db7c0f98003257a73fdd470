Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle, has declared that politicians are to be blamed for insecurity in Nigeria. NAN reports that he spoke on Tuesday at the Special Army Super Camp Faskari, Katsina. Matawalle was in the state alongside Sokoto State Govenror, Aminu Tambuwal. He insisted that security is not only the responsibility of the President, Governors, Service Chiefs and security apparatuses alone. “We, the politicians, are to be blamed for the intractable security challenges bedeviling our communities. It is evident that some politicians exploit insecurity for political gains. “These unscrupulous politicians will hardly commend the military for their successes at the battlefronts. However, they will be eager to rush to the media to report attacks by bandits or other miscreants.” Matawalle said for such individuals, politics is not about genuine commitment to the wellbeing of the people but about power. He urged security agencies to deal decisively with anyone found politicising security no matter how highly placed. The governor added that this would significantly address current security challenges.

The leadership crisis rocking the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Plateau State has taken a new dimension as some aspirants vying for state executive positions have vowed to boycott the state congress slated for tomorrow (Saturday). Addressing journalists less than 24 hours to the state congress, former Acting National Legal Adviser and aspirant for vice chairmanship position, Plateau North, Barr. Simon Jok, who spoke on behalf of other aspirants, said none of them were screened for the state congress. Jok said, “We purchased forms to contest for the state congress of the PDP, we paid our administrative charges but we were not informed of the screening of aspirants which was done in secret. “As we speak, we have 13 cases arising from local government congress and 66 cases from wards congresses. “However, base on our meeting on the August 19, 2020, with Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom in Abuja, we resolved that the Caretaker Committee in the state would be dissolved and a neutral committee be set up. “We also resolved that all cases in court should be withdrawn and the committee be given 90 days to conduct free, fair and credible state Congress,” he explained. “The committee has been dissolved and a new one set up but surprisingly, 24 hours after the committee was set up, we are hearing that there will be state congress on Saturday. “We will not accept anything more than the resolution from the meeting convened by Governor Ortom. If there is no fairness, if there is no justice and if they go ahead to conduct the congress, we will go to court to challenge the outcome.” Also speaking, former member of the House of Representatives and a chairmanship aspirant, Hon. Bitrus Kaze, called on the National Working Committee of the party to suspend the congress and resolve all court litigations for a smooth state congress.

The Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has said that the federal government can’t fight corruption alone. Ganduje said the fight needs the input of state and local governments. He spoke during an inspection of the renovation work at the state’s Public Complaint and Anti-Corruption Commission headquarters in the state capital, yesterday. The governor charged the anti-corruption commission in the state not to spare anybody found compromising in the fight against corruption. Ganduje promised not to interfere in the commission’s fight against corruption in the state. “Whosoever falls in the Commission’s trap should face the consequence. I will have nothing to do with it. I will not interfere with any case whosoever might be involved. “With the way corruption is fighting back and being an agenda of President Muhammad Buhari to fight against corruption, the federal government cannot fight corruption alone, it needs domestication in the states and the local governments to succeed,” he said.

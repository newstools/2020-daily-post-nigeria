The Nigerian Defence Academy (NDA) has warned the general public of a fraudulent gang claiming to be admission officers. NDA Public Relations Officer, Major Abubakar Abdullahi, in a statement on Saturday, particularly cautioned applicants of the 72 Regular Course. He said the syndicate prints fake admission letters and gives the same to candidates after collecting money. “The Academy strongly advises the public to disregard such letters, they were not initiated by the NDA. The general public should note that selection into NDA is by merit not pay”, Abdullahi noted. He reiterated that NDA uses only mainstream media, website www.nda.edu.ng and official Facebook and Twitter accounts – DefenceAcademyNG and HQ_NDA – to disseminate information. “NDA will never direct you to call any phone number for admission or payment. The general public is therefore advised not to fall prey or have any dealings with the said admission fraudsters.” Abdullahi urged Nigerians to report scammers to the nearest military or police unit.

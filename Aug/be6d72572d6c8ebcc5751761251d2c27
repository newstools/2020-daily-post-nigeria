Big Brother Naija housemates, Brighto and Laycon have said that there is only one real couple in the house. They believe that Neo and Vee are currently the only serious relationship in the Lockdown edition that could survive outside the house. It’s already clear to housemates and most viewers that though Erica and Kiddwaya share some romance, there is nothing concrete between them. Kiddwaya had made it clear on national television that he has no feelings for Erica and had in other occasions told fellow housemates he is just having fun. For, Ozo and Nengi, nothing serious seems to be happening between them even though they are always seen around each other. And having observed this, Brighto told Neo, “In all this things, the only relationship I feel is working and may survive this show is yours and Vee. “I’m not lying. I been saying it even before the others who feel they have relationships. I’ve told you before now. I can see it.” Adding his voice, Laycon added, “Yes. You can see the dynamics and all the difference. It’s joyful to behold . I’m very happy that I witnessed the how the two of you started.” Video Brighto and Laycon reveal the only true relationship in the #BBNajia house #bbnaijalockdown2020 pic.twitter.com/Bv1K448elu — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 15, 2020

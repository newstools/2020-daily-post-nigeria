Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will not sign a new deal unless the Gunners make some big signings this summer. Aubameyang fired Arsenal to their 14th FA Cup trophy on Saturday with a 2-1 win over Chelsea and manager, Mikel Arteta is desperate for the striker to sign a new contract. Aubameyang’s current contract at the North London club is in its final year. It is believed that the Gabonese striker wants a three-year deal worth £250,000 a week. According to Le 10 Sport, Aubameyang is eager for Arsenal to make some big moves in the transfer window and is ‘dreaming’ of Arteta’s side luring Barcelona star Ousmane Dembele to the Emirates. The 31-year-old is wanted by a host of clubs across Europe and has already told Arsenal hierarchy his financial conditions to sign a new deal. Arsenal chiefs are prepared to give into Aubameyang’s demands, but could still be forced to deal with the exit of a striker. Aubameyang joined Arsenal from Bundesliga giants, Borussia Dortmund in 2018.

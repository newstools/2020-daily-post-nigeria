US incumbent President, Donald Trump, has declared that the only way he would lose the November presidential election was if it is rigged. The latest polls survey show Joe Biden maintains lead over President Donald Trump ahead of the election. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released Sunday, Biden was up by 9 percentage points. He leads in 11 combined battleground states – Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Biden is ahead in three Midwest states that voted for Trump in 2016 – Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. However, the incumbent President is building a narrative of widespread voter fraud and a “silent majority” that will give him the needed backing in November. Trump said the “Only way we’re going to lose this election is if the election is rigged.” “The only way they’re gonna win is that way,” as quoted by UK Independent.

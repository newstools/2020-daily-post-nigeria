Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Prince has expressed sadness over being paired with Nengi for the Pepsi challenge. Nengi and Prince were paired to perform a song from Tiwa savage. However, they forgot their lyrics and their presentation was not coordinated on stage. At the end of the task, Ozo and Trikytee emerged winners and won N1m cash each, with an all expense paid trip to Dubai. On the other hand, Prince and Nengi won an all expense paid trip to the One Africa Music Fest, Dubai for winning the puzzle task. Prince, who was disappointed about not winning the N1million cash prize told Tolanibaj that Nengi is to blame for the lapses in the presentation. According to him, they lost because Nengi failed to sing her part of the song and forgot the choreography on stage. He told Tolanibaj that he is always unlucky with teammates and has not won anything from team challenges in BBNaija house. Prince said: “I’ve been close every time to winning and now Trikytee and Ozo won. “The part Nengi was supposed to sing she didn’t sing it. The choreography Nengi was supposed to do she forgot. “Our performance was supposed to be like Trikytee and Ozo but Nengi forgot some of the moves. “I don’t blame her but I felt we should have practiced more. During rehearsals it was perfect. “There’s no point talking to her about it but I feel unlucky because everytime we have to do a task I’m good at, I’m always unlucky with my teammate. “I’m always bringing the energy and the other person is not. I told Nengi we had to bring all the energy but she didn’t on stage.”

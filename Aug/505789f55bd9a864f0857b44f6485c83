Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, on Sunday, dismissed claims that Adams Oshiomhole, immediate past National Chairman of the APC was his godfather. Ize-Iyamu, who spoke on Arise Television, disclosed that Oshiomhole works for him. The APC governorship candidate recalled that he stepped down for Oshiomhole in 2007 to run for governor of the state. He, however, stated that there is a mutual respect between him and Oshiomhole. According to Ize-Iyamu: “The only person that is really my godfather is God himself. “In 2007, so that he can become governor, my people were urging me to become governor but I stepped down for him because his area has never had a governor, he comes from Edo north. “Where I come from, Edo southwest has had a governor. I just thought that well, for equity to prevail, it will be nice to make history. Of course, he has done so well as chairman of APC and I just said well, you know it’s good. “Oshiomhole is working for me, he is campaigning with me because he is also passionate about his party winning Edo and you can’t take that away from him.”

Former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, has reacted to the ongoing crisis in the Edo State House of Assembly. On Thursday morning, the premises of Edo State House of Assembly, was besieged by officers of the Nigeria Police Force. It is believed that some members elected on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and loyal to the former party chairman, Adams Oshiomole, had perfected plans for sitting at the complex which is currently under renovation. The Convener of Pro-Democracy and Human Rights group, Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, claimed Oshiomhole was behind the incident and the ultimate aim was to impeach Governor Obaseki, with one month to the gubernatorial poll.alleges/ Atiku in a statement has warned for the status quo to be preserved, or else there will be ‘grave danger’. He said: “Nigeria has been on edge due to the brinkmanship of those charged with democratic leadership. We must, as a nation, not escalate the already tense atmosphere in our polity. “What is happening in Edo State is a threat to constitutional order nationwide, and I strongly urge belligerent forces to rein in their proxies and abide by the rule of law. As I have previously said, without the rule of law, there will be no rule at all. “The current goings-on portend grave danger, not only to law and order in that state but to the coming Edo elections. “The people of Edo state should be allowed to choose who they wish to govern them, and that choice is to be made on September 19, 2020. Pending then, everything legally possible must be done to preserve the status quo.”

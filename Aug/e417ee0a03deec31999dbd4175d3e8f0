English football will be banned for six to 12 games for racist behaviour, according to the new Football Association sanctioning guidelines, ESPN reports. FIFA and UEFA both proposed a minimum of 10-game ban for racism or other forms of discrimination. But the FA has said they will issue bans for less than six matches, if the discrimination happens on social media or if specific mitigating factors are presented. The executive director of football’s anti-discrimination Fare Network, Piara Powar, however said the new rules does not acknowledge any sanctions for football supporters. “Again the FA has shifted the burden on to individuals – mostly players – who transgress. “Clubs whose fans behave consistently badly will get a minor sanction, despite the fact that these types of incidents are the most damaging. The FA just does not want to punish clubs,” Powar said. Bernardo Silva was banned for one game for a controversial social media post towards Manchester City team-mate, Benjamin Mendy, while Tottenham midfielder Dele Alli received the same punishment for appearing to mock an Asian man over COVID-19.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Ozo on Sunday morning accused Nengi of not speaking the truth about the bathroom moment with Kiddwaya. Kiddwaya and Nengi were caught in the bathroom by Ozo. However, when approached by Ozo who was jealous, Nengi said she just needed help to zip her outfit. Ozo who was not convinced by her explanation told Neo that Nengi was just making up stories about the situation. According to him, he values trust and that’s the only thing he wants from Nengi in their friendship. Ozo said: “The only thing I want to tell Nengi is there’s nothing I value more in a friendship than trust. “Forget relationship. It’s better she gives me the true stuff than make up a story and give me bullshit about that situation.”

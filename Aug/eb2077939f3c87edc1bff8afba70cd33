Evicted Big Brother Naija housemate, Eric has said he walked shirtless in the reality show to sell himself. Eric, who was on different occasions caught without wearing a shirt, and was always leading the workout session, said he wanted to show viewers he could transform people’s bodies. The ‘foodie’ said one of his strategies was to showcase himself and his ability to turn fat to muscles. He told Pulse, “My strategy was to sell myself so if you watch the show, you will see me a lot without my shirt to show people that I put in a lot of work into my body and to show them that this is what I do . “I transform people’s bodies from what it was to what it can be”. He also stated that he will be focusing on his fitness brand and other things he has in mind. Meanwhile, Eric on Wednesday said he wanted his friend Neo to win the reality show.

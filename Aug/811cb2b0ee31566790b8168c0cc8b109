As the rift between Anambra State Governor, Chief Willie Obiano and some traditional rulers continues, lawmakers in the state have backed the governor, accusing the federal government of abandoning the Enugu-Onitsha expressway. The governor is allegedly in controversy with some traditional rulers who went to Abuja to commend President Muhammadu Buhari over some infrastructural project in the South East. The lawmakers raised the alarm over the state of Enugu-Onitsha Expressway being constructed by the Federal Government, saying that it has been abandoned. The assembly in a resolution it passed on Friday, urged the President to direct the Ministry of Works to cause the contractor, Reynolds Construction Company, to return to the site. The lawmakers in the resolution said the Enugu-Onitsha Expressway had been abandoned and it had become a discomfort to road commuters. “We urge the Federal Government to direct the construction firm handling the contract to go back to the site to alleviate the sufferings of the road users. “The expressway is an important Trunk -A highway, known for its heavy vehicular traffic. It was abandoned and became dilapidated for several years and left the users of the deplorable road in griefs.” The contract for the reconstruction of the Anambra State section of the Enugu -Onitsha Expressway was awarded to RCC in November 2018 with a completion period of 42 months. The lawmakers expressed worry that the lockdown and interstate border closures had been lifted by the Federal Government several weeks ago, yet the contractor had not gone back to the site.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Dorathy has revealed the intimate conversation she had with Brighto on Saturday night. Brighto on Sunday night told Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, official host of BBNaija that he feels there is a triangle between Dorathy, Ozo and Nengi and thinks Dorathy has feelings for Ozo despite her denial. However, Dorathy in a conversation with Brighto after eviction of Eric and Tochi said she felt offended about his discussion with Ebuka. According to her, she meant what she said to Brighto on Saturday night that she wants to kiss him and was not drunk. Dorathy said: “You offended me Bright because we had a discussion last night and you didn’t take me seriously because you thought I was drunk. “I remember everything, I meant every word I said, including the part I said I wanted to kiss you. “Everyone was shocked, but I said I don’t know, I can’t explain.” #Dora is angry with #brighto for refusing to kiss her …. I don't think Brighto is looking for a girlfriend #BBNaijialockdown2020#bbnaija2020lockdown #BBNaija pic.twitter.com/M91LCZArF9 — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 10, 2020

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija Lockdown, housemate, Dorathy, has revealed that her biggest ‘distraction’ in the house at the moment is Brighto. Dorathy told Biggie during her diary session on Friday. She also suggested that she feels something really deep for Brighto, who seems to have been caught up between two ladies in the house. The busty lady, after telling Biggie, asked him to advise her on the situation, adding that now she can’t even get close to Brighto because she cannot control herself when she gets close to him.

The African Union Commission has reacted to the arrest and detention of Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita and Prime Minister Boubou Cisse by mutinying soldiers. The African Union Commission kicked against the arrests of Keita, Cisse and other officials which happened on Tuesday. Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, also condemned any attempt at “anti-constitutional” change while calling on the mutinying soldiers to respect the state’s institutions. “I energetically condemn the arrest of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, the prime minister and other members of the Malian government and call for their immediate liberation,” he wrote on Twitter. DAILY POST reported on Tuesday that Malian soldiers arrested the country’s president, Ibrahim Boubacar and Prime Minister Boubou Cisse. DAILY POST had reported that soldiers on earlier on Tuesday rounded up senior government and military officers in Kati town and elsewhere. During the arrest, there were scenes of thousands of citizens cheering the ouster. Crowds are jubilating at Independence Square in Bamako, Mali, and other places. For more nearly three months, demonstrations demanding for Keita’s resignation were held. Dozens lost their lives, a situation that worsened the crisis. Keita’s removal comes amid the intervention by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).

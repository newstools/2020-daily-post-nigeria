Members of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) Cross River State branch have been accused of not wearing nose mask. A private medical practitioner, Dr Asuquo Simon in a statement on Friday in Calabar, Cross River State capital, alleged that the recent death of a medical doctor may not be unconnected from the non-wearing of nose mask and observance of PTF protocol. The medical doctor said that the situation in Cross River required the NMA in the state to equip their members (doctors) with the knowledge of COVID-19 protocols and management, instead of the association behaving as an opposition to the Cross River State government. The statement added that the State Government started the no mask no movement, since March 2020, but regretted that it was not adhered to by some health workers, especially doctors. According to Dr Simon, it was sad to note that some doctors in public and private hospitals do not use face mask always at their work places. “Some do not know the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) protocols; some do not have access to the SOP for management and referral of suspected cases of COVID-19,” he said. He said that these were the types of engagement and sensitisation drive that a committed association should have if the welfare of its people was topmost on its mind. “NMA Cross River Chapter should begin sensitisation of its members on the compulsory use of face ask at all times. “This would not need to put any financial strain on the resources of NMA as this training can be done virtually,” he noted On the allegation of under-reporting of COVID-19 cases in the state, Dr Simon queried, “was that responsible for doctors contracting the virus? Will reporting of 1000 non-existent cases stop doctors from getting infected?”

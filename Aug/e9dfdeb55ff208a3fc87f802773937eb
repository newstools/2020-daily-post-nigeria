The UEFA Champions League resumes this weekend across Europe. Europeâ€™s top club competition has been on hold since March this year, due to the Coronavirus outbreak. However, on Friday, Juventus welcome Lyon, while Real Madrid travel to face Manchester City. The first leg of the last-16 tie between Juve and Lyon ended in a 1-1 draw in France. City beat Real 2-1 at the Santiago Bernabeu, when both sides first met. On Saturday, Chelsea need a miracle to qualify for the quarter-finals. The Blues trail 3-0 ahead of the second leg at Bayern Munich. The tie between Barcelona and Napoli is delicately poised at 1-1 ahead of the game at Camp Nou. The quarter-finals begin August 12.

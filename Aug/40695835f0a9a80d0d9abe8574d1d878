The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has admitted that some of its officials are corrupt. EFCC zonal head in Lagos State, Abdulrasheed Bawa said officials of the commission caught involved in corrupt practices are prosecuted. Bawa stated this while responding to questions on TVC, on Wednesday. He also urged Nigerians to help identify corrupt officials of the anti-graft agency. “Certainly, we are not angels. There are some bad elements within the system. But we charge them to court whenever they are caught. “We need Nigerians to help us call out any corrupt EFCC official they come across,” Bawa said. This is coming at a time the Presidency is investigating suspended acting EFCC chairman, Ibrahim Magu over alleged corrupt practices. Magu’s ongoing probe is an offshoot of an indictment by the Attorney General of Federation, Abubakar Malami. Malami had accused Magu of misappropriation and corruption.

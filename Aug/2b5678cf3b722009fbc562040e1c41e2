The Edo State House Assembly, under the new leadership, Speaker Rt. Hon. Victor Edoror, has urged Governor Godwin Obaseki, to steer clear the legislative business for which the 7th assembly was elected and inaugurated to perform. Edoror, during the first House plenary on Friday, gave the order saying, “it is high time the governor allowed the House to function independently so the gap created for the past one year can be covered.” Earlier, the Clerk of the House, Mr. Samuel Efezokhae, did a roll call of the members present and 17 out of 24 members were present for legislative proceedings. After the role call by the Clerk, the Deputy Speaker, Hon Emmanuel Agbaje, representing Akoko- Edo 2, during the first legislative business, informed the House on the need to draw the attention of the governor to the ravaging insecurity bedeviling the state. He raised a motion of urgent public importance as it affects the society, which he said was becoming more worrisome and people were beginning to fill that government can non longer protect lives and property in the state. After a robust deliberation by the honourable members with various views of concerns, the Deputy Speaker moved a motion, which was seconded by majority as follows; that Gov. Obaseki as a matter of urgency set up a security committee in conjunction with the Nigeria Police, the Department of State Service, DSS, and other security outfits to reduce to the barest minimum security challenges in the state. Edoror directed that a copy of the resolution be sent to the governor for immediate implementation. In his closing remark, the Speaker directed Governor Obaseki to allow the lawmakers to carry out their duties legitimately without interference from the executive arm.

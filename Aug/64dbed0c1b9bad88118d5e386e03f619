Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, singled out Juan Mata for praise following their 1-0 win over FC Copenhagen on Monday night. The Red Devils are now through to the semi-finals of the Europa League, where they will face either Wolves or Sevilla. Mata was introduced from the bench in extra time, as Solskjaer’s men struggled to break down the Danish side after 90 minutes. The Spaniard helped to break the deadlock, by setting up Anthony Martial who was fouled in the penalty area. Bruno Fernandes stepped up and scored the only goal of the game in the 97th minute. “You saw when he came on he’s so composed, calm,” Solskjaer said. “He can pick a pass. He is such a great influence in the dressing room. I can just commend him for his professionalism. “Of course he is disappointed he has not played more.”

Some members of the Barcelona board are not against Lionel Messi leaving the club, ESPN reports. Although some are hoping to persuade the 32-year-old to stay, others would not fight against Messi being sold under the right circumstances. Messi is believed to have met new manager, Ronald Koeman this week and admitted he sees himself more out than in at Camp Nou. Koeman himself is keen to keep the player and build his team around him. But the Argentine superstar is considering his future at the club, after a series of events in the last year, including bust-ups with former sporting director, Eric Abidal. On the pitch, Champions League exits against Roma and Liverpool have been followed by a first trophyless season since 2007/2008, with the shameful 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich topping everything off. Messiâ€™s doubts about his future have generated an internal debate among the board. Some directors would be prepared to listen to offers that would allow Koeman to reconstruct the team and at the same time reduce the wage bill.

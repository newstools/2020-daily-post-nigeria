Sen. Wali Jibrin, the Chairman, Board of Trustees of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), on Thursday lifted the suspension of Sen. Solomon Ewuga, Musa Elayo and Muhammed Onawo, former House of Representatives member with immediate effect. Wali made this known on Thursday while speaking in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Nasarawa, Nasarawa Local Government Area of Nasarawa State. The suspension of the affected party leaders was lifted following the submission of reports by the reconciliation committee on the crisis in the state. “I want to disclose to you that we have lifted the suspension of Sen. Ewuga, Muhammed Onawo and Rep. Musa Elayo. “When we received the reports of the reconciliation committee, we agreed to lift the suspension on Ewuga, Muhammed Onawo and Musa Elayo. He instructed that all court cases be withdrawn in the interest of peace and for the progress of the party. The PDP in the state had been engulfed in an intra-party crisis that led to the suspension of some chieftains. On May 28, a High Court in Akwanga, Nasarawa State presided over by Justice Mustapha Rahamat, nullified the ward and local government congresses recently held in the state.

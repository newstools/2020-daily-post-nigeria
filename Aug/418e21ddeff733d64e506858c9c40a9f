The defendant pleaded not guilty to the allegation preferred against him by the police. Defence counsel, Okobe Najite, applied for the bail of the defendant in a most liberal term. However, the prosecutor opposed the bail application of the counsel, saying that the victim is in critical condition and yet to recovered.

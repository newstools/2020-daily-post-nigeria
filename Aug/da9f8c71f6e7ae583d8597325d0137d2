The protracted crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Ekiti State assumed a new dimension on Thursday as parallel council executives emerged from local government council congress. The parallel executives emerged from the council congress held at two different locations with each faction announcing new executive officers. Olujimi faction held their congress at the party secretariat across the 16 local government Area while the camp loyal to Fayose held theirs at residence of party leaders. Fayose and Olujimi have been at each otherâ€™s throats over the soul of the Ekiti PDP and its architectural structures, which has polarised the party into two dominant factions. The leadership tussle resulted into the emergence of parallel executives from the March 17 ward congress, which the duo saw as an opportunity to capture the party machinery ahead of the 2022 gubernatorial election in the state. Olujimi blamed the crisis in the state chapter of the party on Prince Uche Secondus-led National Working Committee, for its complicity.

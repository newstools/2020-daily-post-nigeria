Manchester United legend, Ryan Giggs, has advised the club to sign Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho and Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish if both players are available in the summer transfer market. Giggs believes both Sancho and Grealish would be an excellent signing for the Red Devils. “Two good players [Sancho and Grealish],” Giggs told the Webby and O’Neill YouTube channel. “I think the thing with Grealish is he is obviously used to the Premier League and does not need to adapt to it so that is good. “For me from the outside, it looks like he has got the mentality to come to this place and not bother him. “Certain players can get overawed. Also, the good thing this year is he has got ten goals and got into double digits. To get to double digits with no penalties for Aston Villa is impressive. “Sancho is quick, direct, but also an intelligent player. What I like about him is when he gets into the areas with the final ball, he does not panic. “A lot of quick wide players sometimes do, but he picks out the right pass. He is someone who can counter-attack if we are going to play that but also if a team is going to sit back, he can beat players and make things happen. “They are two signings that may be available, and if we are able to get them, I would go and get them.” Meanwhile, both Sancho and Grealish have been linked with a move to Man United this summer.

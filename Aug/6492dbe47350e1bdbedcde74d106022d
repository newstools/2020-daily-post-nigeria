Manchester United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has been left unimpressed by two things in the transfer negotiations with Borussia Dortmund for their winger, Jadon Sancho. Sancho remains Manchester United’s number one top transfer target this summer transfer window. Man United have been chasing Sancho for the past couple of months, with the Red Devils manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, making it clear how much he wants the 20-year-old. United have been negotiating with Dortmund for Sancho. However, the Old Trafford club are yet to make a breakthrough when it comes to the England international despite Solskjaer making it clear to Woodward he wants a deal done quickly. Bleacher Report is now reporting that Woodward has been unimpressed by both “price tag and the date set for a transfer”. DAILY POST recalls that Dortmund had made it clear they will only let Sancho leave if United can meet their huge £120 million asking price for the player. The Bundesliga club have also given a deadline of August 10 for Solskjaer’s side to sign Sancho before they commence their pre-season tour ahead of the 2020/21 season. Sancho netted 17 goals and provided 17 assists from 34 Bundesliga matches for Dortmund this season.

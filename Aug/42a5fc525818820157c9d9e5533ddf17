Ghana is planning to reopen its entry points for inbound traffic on September 1. This follows a decline in active COVID-19 cases in the country. President Nana Akufo-Addo in his 15th nationwide broadcast on COVID-19 said the decision would be based on the outcome of joint work by various stakeholders. “Under my instructions, the Ministry of Aviation, the Ghana Civil Aviation Authority and the Ghana Airports Co. Ltd, have been working, with the ministry of health and its agencies, to ascertain our readiness to reopen our airport. “The outcome will show us the way, and determine when we can reopen our border by air. “I am hoping that we will be ready to do so by September 1,” Akufo-Addo said. Akufo-Addo, however, said special dispensation would be given for the evacuation of Ghanaians stranded abroad. —

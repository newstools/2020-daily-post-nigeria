New Chelsea signing, Ben Chilwell, has disclosed that the Blues boss, Frank Lampard, was the person that convinced him to join the Stamford Bridge club from Leicester City. Chilwell said that Lampard won him over to Chelsea with his vision for the club. DAILY POST had reported that Chilwell officially joined Chelsea from Leicester on Wednesday for a fee of around £50m. Chilwell, 23, joins Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner as Lampard’s new signings this summer. “I am delighted to be joining Chelsea, and the manager played a massive part in me signing here,” The England left-back, who signed a five-year deal with Chelsea, was quoted by Metro UK as saying. “I think every player wants to play for a huge club in their career and I am no different, but talking to Frank [Lampard] before I signed really made up my mind that I wanted to come and play here. “He installed a lot of confidence in me, he told me about the system he wants to play, how I would fit into that and he just seemed like a really good guy that you could talk to about anything. “It is important to have that relationship and trust with a manager, and he’s also very keen on young players being given a chance. “We have seen that over the past season under Frank, he does play the younger players if they are good enough and just from speaking to him, I am really excited to be here, and I cannot wait to get started. “He told me about the system, and of course I watched and played against Chelsea over the season, so I know what I am coming into. I think the way the gaffer sets his teams up is just perfect for me and suits my game perfectly. I just can’t wait to get started, and hopefully, there are many great years to come.”

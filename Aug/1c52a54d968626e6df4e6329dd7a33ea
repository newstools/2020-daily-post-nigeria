A High Court on Monday in Ado Ekiti sentenced a 26-year-old, Dele Ojo, to death by hanging for killing a farmer. The prosecution counsel, Mr Wale Fapohunda, while presenting the case in court said Ojo committed the offence on Sept. 13, 2018, at Iroko Ekiti in Ijero Local Government Area of Ekiti, when he murdered one Ajayi Adewole. He said the offence was contrary to Section 319 of the Criminal Code Law, Cap. C16, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. According to him, the convict had been stealing yams from the deceased’s farm. “The convict shot the deceased at close range at the farm,” he added. NAN reports that the accused testified in his own defence through his lawyer, Mr Yinka Oyeleke. However, Justice Abiodun Adesodun, while delivering his judgement said “the circumstances of this case do not allow for a recommendation of clemency to the governor on behalf of the convict. “You are hereby sentenced to death by hanging, may the Lord have mercy upon his soul,” the Justice said.

The Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Taskforce) have marked some buildings in lbeju Lekki as illegal structures. The buildings which encroached on ‘Idera Land Scheme’ in lbeju Lekki are be demolished as the Lagos State Government plans to redevelop Apapa Tin Can Island Park. In a statement released signed by the Head, Public Affairs Unit, Lagos State Task Force, Adebayo Taofiq, the Task Force Chairman, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi said all illegal structures and shanties encroaching the ‘Idera Land Scheme’, Ibeju Lekki would be demolished after the expiration of the 7 days ‘Removal Order’ served by the Agency on Wednesday, August 19, 2020. CSP Egbeyemi disclosed further that the Government had observed with dismay the massive encroachment by individuals, private estate developers and land speculators on lands, using them to defraud innocent members of the public into purchasing parcels of land within government acquisition areas across the state particularly around Ibeju-Lekki corridor. He implored Lagosians, who are interested in purchasing lands in the State, to first verify the land records at the State Land Registry or Surveyor General’s Office where millions of land documents are stored in the ‘Electronic Data Management System (EDMS)’ consisting details of documented lands and properties in Lagos in order not to be swindled by land speculators. “All illegal structures and buildings constructed on State lands by persons, companies or institutions without valid titles from the Government across the State would be removed,” he added. The Task Force Chairman also warned miscreants, illegal mechanics, food vendors and owners of illegal shanties within Apapa Tin Can Island Park to vacate within 7 days as the entire area is set to be redeveloped and given a new look in line with the T.H.E.M.E agenda of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu. He said that a situation where illegal squatters jump on Government Acquired Land to erect illegal structures and shanties would no longer be tolerated by the government.

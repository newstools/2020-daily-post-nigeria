New Barcelona boss, Ronald Koeman, has began his cull at the club. The former Everton and Netherlands manager has told Luis Suarez, Arturo Vidal, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti to find new clubs this summer, according to the UK Guardian. Koeman was appointed as Quique Setien’s replacement last week and has not wasted time in shaping up the squad ahead of the new campaign. His first priority was speaking to Lionel Messi about his future at the club and although the Argentine remains unhappy with the club’s management, the Dutchman is confident that the 33-year-old will stay at the club. Koeman also wants to add to the team, but cannot do so until the LaLiga club sells off some players. Because of this, Koeman has been ruthless in his conversations with certain players, informing them they are now surplus to requirement at the Nou Camp.

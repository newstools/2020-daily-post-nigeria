Big Brother Naija housemate, Erica has stated why she told her love interest, Kiddwaya to pick Tolanibaj as his deputy. Recall that Kiddwaya who emerged winner of this week’s Head of House picked Tolanibaj to share the privileges with him. Speaking to Kiddwaya on Tuesday morning, Erica said she told him to pick Tolanibaj because she is her friend. When Kiddwaya asked why not Nengi, Erica maintained that Nengi is not her friend. Kiddwaya, however, added that if he had picked Nengi she would have left all the work for him to do, as she appears lazy. “ I want to see the kind of leader Tolanibaj is. It would be an opportunity to get her out of her comfort zone.”

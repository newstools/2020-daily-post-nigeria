Inter Milan striker, Romelu Lukaku, on Monday night set a new Europa League record following his side’s 5-0 victory against Shakhtar Donetsk in the semi-final. Two goals each from Romelu Lukaku and Lautaro Martinez and a strike from Danilo D’Abrosio ensured Antonio Conte’s men defeated the Ukrainian side at the Esprit Arena in Germany. Lukaku’s brace against Shakhtar Donetsk means the former Manchester United and Chelsea star has now become the first ever player to score in 10 Europa League games in a row. DAILY POST recalls that Lukaku had scored against Bayer Leverkusen in the Europa League quarter-final last week.

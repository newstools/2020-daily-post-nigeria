Andrew Kwasari, Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Agriculture, has advised Nigerians to be more patient with the current government. He said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday. “Nigerians need to be patient with one another and we need to be patient with our government first. “We need to understand also that as a country of 200 million and counting, it is a herculean task to deliver change because we’ve not built systems to deliver change in the past. Kwasari said the federal government mean well for the masses. He noted that Buhari and his vice, Yemi Osinbajo were not interested “in benefitting from the common purse. This is the first time we have had it this good.” Kwasari said Nigeria got to its present stage for prioritising material success to the detriment of rewarding hard work, honesty and integrity. “Nigeria is in a difficult situation, a product of years of decisive move towards doing the wrong thing. The easiest corruption Nigeria is dealing with is material corruption. There’s a bigger corruption; the moral corruption.”

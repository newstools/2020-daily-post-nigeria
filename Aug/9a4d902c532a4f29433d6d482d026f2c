Angry FC Barcelona fans have called for the resignation of club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, after captain Lionel Messi announced on Tuesday that he wished to leave the Catalan side. A large crowd of fans outside FC Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium on Tuesday night were heard chanting “We love you, Messi stay, Messi stay!” and “Bartomeu resign!” An 80-year-old Joana Polo, wearing an FC Barcelona face mask, on Wednesday outside Camp Nou told Reuters: “I am very upset, for me Barca is Messi and Messi is Barca. They are the same, he is the symbol of Barca. “They should erect a monument in Camp Nou for him. I do not think Messi’s departure should be allowed to happen.” Barcelona President, Josep Bartomeu had assured fans that Messi would stay at the Camp Nou next season, following the 8-2 defeat against Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-final. However, Messi wants Barca to terminate his contract, so he can join a new club. Another fan at Camp Nou said, “You can take defeats in sports but I can’t handle Messi leaving,” Oriol, 40 told Reuters.

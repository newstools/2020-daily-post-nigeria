Former Chelsea captain, John Terry, was left unimpressed with the performance of referee, Anthony Talyor, during the Blues’ FA Cup final defeat against Arsenal. Christian Pulisic opened scoring at Wembley, but Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang levelled from the spot, after he was fouled by Cesar Azpilicueta. The match was all but settled following Aubameyang’s second and Mateo Kovacic receiving a second yellow from Taylor in the 73rd minute. Kovacic was sent off for an innocuous looking challenge on Granit Xhaka. Terry has taken to Instagram, to question two decisions Taylor took during the game, including not giving a foul on Andreas Christensen in the build up to the winner. He wrote: “Never a second yellow, and surely that was a foul in the build up to the second goal.”

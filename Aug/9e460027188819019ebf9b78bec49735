President Muhammadu Buhari has directed state governments and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), to enforce the compulsory use of face masks in public places nationwide. This was disclosed by Boss Mustapha, the Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) and Chairman of the Presidential Task force on COVID-19. Mustapha was speaking with journalists during Thursday’s PTF briefing. According to him, “President Buhari also asked the PTF to partner with states and local governments to improve community sensitisation and engagement to step up response to the COVID-19 response. “He also encouraged state governments to collaborate with local government authorities to intensify necessary measures such as contact tracing, grassroots mobilisation and risk communication. “He also ordered that collaboration with other mandate groups at federal/state levels to harmonise the country’s COVID-19 response be strengthened on the short, medium and long-term basis.”

Barcelona presidential candidate, Victor Font, has called on incumbent Josep Bartomeu to “resign now”, AS reports. This follows news that Lionel Messi has informed the club he is leaving. Bartomeu had assured fans that Messi would be at the Camp Nou next season, following the 8-2 thrashing against Bayern Munich in the Champions League quarter-final. However, Messi wants Barca to terminate his contract, so he can join a new club. Font has now asked Bartomeu to step down and called for elections to be held immediately. “Bartomeu, resign now! You’ve been unable to manage the best footballer ever, a legend made here. Hence why we repeat: Bartoméu resign and elections as soon as possible,” Font said.

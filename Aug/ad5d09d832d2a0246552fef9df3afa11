It urged the public to disregard the reports in circulation as it was the handiwork of mischief-makers. It said, “We hereby categorically state that there was no fire incident in any of our offices. “The publication is false and it is the handiwork of mischief-makers who are out to misinform, mislead and confuse the candidates and members of the public. “We wish to reassure all candidates, stakeholders and members of the public that our security material are safe and intact.” Meanwhile, the 2020 West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) will hold on August 17 and end on Saturday, September 12.

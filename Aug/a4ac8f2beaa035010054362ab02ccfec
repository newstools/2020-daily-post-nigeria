Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemate, Wathoni and Erica on Friday night engaged in a heated argument. The argument started after Wathoni made a comment saying Kiddwaya never chased any girl in the house. Her comment was after Erica said she would not chase guys. This got Erica pissed as she approached Wathoni to ask her why she threw a shade at her in front of the housemates. Wathoni said: “I’m not here to have a man, I’m here for the money “I don’t give a fu*ck about Kiddwaya and we should not be having this conversation. “I would not have an issue with you because of a man. Behave yourself and respect yourself. “I don’t have time for all of that but here for meaningful friendships. “It’s nothing serious, it’s all fun and games. “I was not throwing shade at you but it was what I felt. I would not belittle myself for that nonsense.”

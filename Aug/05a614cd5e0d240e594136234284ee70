Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, tried to force through a transfer to Chelsea in January, the Daily Mail reports. However, the move collapsed because of his high wage demands. Aubameyang will lead the Gunners out against Chelsea on Saturday in the FA Cup final. But it has now emerged he was keen to swap red and white for blue. Contact was made on behalf of the Gabon striker, as he was keen on a move to Stamford Bridge, but his high wage demands meant that a move didn’t get off the ground. It is claimed Aubameyang would have been comfortably the highest-paid player in Chelsea’s history, if they had bowed to his demands. Aubameyang, who has netted 27 goals so far, has a contract with Arsenal which expires at the end of next season.

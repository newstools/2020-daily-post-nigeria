A housewife, Khadija Sani, has asked a Kubwa Grade 1 Area Court to dissolve her marriage to Abdulsalam Hassan over his failure to pay rent. Khadija resides at Mpape in Abuja, NAN reports. She said Hassan has not performed his duties as a provider since she married him on November 9, 2018. The marriage was contracted under the Islamic law. “I delivered my child in my parent’s house, Hassan could not afford the hospital bills or feed me. We were also ejected from our home because of Hassan’s inability to pay house rent.” Khadija told the court that she had been living with her parents since December 2019. She prayed to the court to dissolve her marriage on the grounds of lack of love. Hassan, however, begged the court to give him some time to settle with his wife. The Judge, Muhammad Adamu adjourned the matter until September 9.

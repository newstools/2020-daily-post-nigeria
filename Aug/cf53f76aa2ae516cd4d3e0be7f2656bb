Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, is close to signing a new contract with Arsenal. The UK Telegraph reports that the 31-year-old will put pen to paper on a three-year contract extension. His original deal was set to expire at the end of next season. Aubameyang will now earn in excess of £300,000-a-week including bonus payments in his proposed new contract. Aubameyang scored 22 Premier League goals last campaign, missing out on the Golden Boot award to Leicester City’s Jamie Vardy. He netted twice against Manchester City and Chelsea in the FA Cup semi-final and final respectively, as the Gunners won the trophy for a record 14th time. Since his move to Arsenal from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018, Aubameyang has scored 54 goals in 85 Premier League games.

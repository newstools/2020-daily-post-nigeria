Big Brother Naija, BBNaija Lockdown housemate, Trikytee, has spoken on the relationship between Nengi and Ozo. Trikytee also commented on the interference on the alleged interference on Nengi and Ozo’s relationship by Kiddwaya Recall that Nengi a few days ago began to show more interest in Kiddwaya than her friend, Ozo. Nengi and Kiddwaya were caught in a rather too close position in the bathroom on Saturday night; an incident that infuriated Ozo. However, when asked by BBNaija host, Ebuka, on Sunday to give his opinion on Nengi and Ozo’s situationship, or if Kiddwaya is an obstruction, Trikytee said the Benue-born billionaire’s son was not a problem between them. Trikytee said: “Me myself too, am lost because you will think that they are a couple. “In my opinion, it is either Nengi is worried about her feelings because the things that they [Ozo and Nengi] do are the things that couples do. “But sometimes there are things that she says that contradicts the things that they do, and that was why I was saying she was hurting her feelings. “The action says something else, and words say something else. Am not sure Kiddwaya is a problem between them.” Watch the video below: Ebuka : what’s your take on Nengi and Ozo? Do you think Kiddwaya is an obstruction?

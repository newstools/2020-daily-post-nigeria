Arsenal midfielder, Dani Ceballos, has informed Real Madrid that he will not stay at Santiago Bernabeu and accept a bit-part role under manager, Zinedine Zidane following the Gunners’ FA Cup final 2-1 victory over Chelsea on Saturday at Wembley. Ceballos joined Arsenal in the summer of 2019 on loan from Real Madrid. The 23-year-old, whose current deal at Arsenal expires this summer, has become a key part of Mikel Arteta’s midfield in the past few months. Speaking after Arsenal’s FA Cup win, Ceballos disclosed that he would hold talks with Real Madrid president, Florentino Perez, to discuss his future after the Los Blancos’ Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie against Manchester City on Friday. “I spoke to Florentino Perez and Jose Angel Sanchez [Madrid’s CEO], and we’ll speak again after Madrid’s game with Manchester City to clarify my future,” Ceballos told El Larguero. “I want to play 35 games [next season] at least. I am one of those who say that when you are happy, you develop your game. “Right now I’m happy, but it’s time to rest at home with my family, with my girlfriend, who has not seen them for a long time, I’ve been alone in London for 5 or 6 months, so now it is time to be with them and reflect on the future. “Compared to any club in the world, Real Madrid is the best. We must wait to see if they come back against Manchester City and we will address my future after that. “Right now I’m enjoying it [FA Cup trophy], I do not think about whether I can play for Real Madrid, Arsenal or another club. “Now it ls time to disconnect. You have to be calm and think well with the family.”

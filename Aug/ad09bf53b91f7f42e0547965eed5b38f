Winner of Big Brother Africa Season 5 reality TV show and Nollywood actor, Uti Nwachukwu, has apologized to 2020 Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, Laycon, over his insulting comments. Nwachukwu had on Friday said on his Twitter handle that Laycon is not on the same level as female housemate, Erica, yet, she has used “jazz” on him. His tweet attracted the wrath of Nigerians, especially fans of Laycon and Nwachukwu has now remorsefully apologized, saying he got carried away. “OK, I got a little carried away watching #Bbnaija guys. What I said really wasn’t cool, and I acknowledge it so it’s deleted,” Nwachukwu tweeted on Friday. “Just a little reminder to all of us to remember that even though it’s a show, they’re real people. So make una no vess #BBNaijialockdown2020.” DAILY POST recalls that both Laycon and Erica have been entangled in a love controversy since the start of the reality show. Erica had disclosed that she is just friends with Laycon and physically attracted to Kiddwaya.

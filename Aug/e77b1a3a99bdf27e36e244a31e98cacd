A 32-year-old Odukoya Ayomide and his colleague, Abiodun Oyenuga, have been arrested by the police in Ogun State. Police said they were arrested on their way for a robbery operation along Awa Ijebu/Ijebu-Ode highway. DAILY POST learnt that the suspects were accosted on the road on August 25, when the DPO of Awa Ijebu police station, CSP Adewalehinmi Joseph, were on routine patrol of the area.

The state Commissioner of Police, Edward Ajogun, has directed that the two suspects be transferred to the SARS unit of the police command for discreet investigation. Ajogun has also warned criminals to steer clear of Ogun State, threatened that “the command will make it too hot for them under his watch.”

Big Brother Naija housemate Brighto has said if, given the chance to break a relationship in the house, he will pick the relationship between. Ozo and Nengi. The Edo born was asked the question in the first-ever, housemate to housemate diary session. Housemates were instructed and paired to act as Big Brother for Thursday’s diary session. Brighto said, “If I am to break up a relationship in the house I will pick the one that is heading nowhere. “And that will be Nengi and Ozo, this is because I will not want to break a relationship that has a goal or destination to attain.”

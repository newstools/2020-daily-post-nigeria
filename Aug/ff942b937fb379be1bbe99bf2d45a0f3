An Ondo State High Court sitting in Akure, the state capital, on Friday set aside the suspension of four members of the State House of Assembly by the leadership of the House. Justice Ademola Bola in his ruling said the Speaker, Hon Bamidele Oleyeloogun lacked the power to suspend any member of the Assembly. While describing the suspension as illegal and unlawful, the court also ordered the Assembly to immediately pay all the entitlements of the affected lawmakers with N5 million Naira damages also awarded. The affected lawmakers are the Deputy Speaker of the House, Iroju Ogundeji, Hon. Adewale Williams, Hon Tomide Akinribido as well as Hon. Favour Semilore Tomomowe. On July 8, 2020, the lawmakers were suspended indefinitely by the leadership of the Assembly over what was described as un-parliamentary act. The affected lawmakers who are loyal to the embattled Deputy Governor of the State, Hon. Agboola Ajayi were among the nine lawmakers who refused to sign the impeachment notice against Ajayi.

Indigenes of the Nanka community in Orumba North Local Government Area of Anambra State have called for the intervention of the state governor, Willie Obiano to end the lingering crisis rocking the community. Members of Ezeokweghi/Ezeofor Royal Family Enugwu-Nanka who addressed a press conference on Tuesday in Awka said that for 10 years, the community has been embroiled in crisis, occasioned by the use of an illegal constitution by a faction of the community to enthrone a new king in the area. Chief Ben Okeke, the chairman of the Ezeokweghi/Ezeofor Royal Family who addressed journalists cried out over attempts by factional members of the Nanka Patriotic Union to evade justice. In a petition sent to the Anambra State governor to seek peace, Okeke said the forged constitution recognised only five villages in Nanka instead of seven as it was previously, while also purporting the rotation of traditional stool among the five villages, leading to courts legal suits. Okeke said that the community is worried because the opposing faction has boasted that it would stall the matter and that they were working with government agents to ensure the matter was discontinued in court. “We call on the Executive Governor of Anambra State, the Hon. Chief Judge of Anambra State, the Honorable Attorney General of Anambra State, the Director of Public Prosecution, Ministry of Justice and the Administrative Judge, Aguata High Court, Ekwulobia, to ensure that there is no more delay in justice regarding the matter. “If the action of the defendants is legitimate; if the defendants have a good defence; why can’t they stand trial and defend their action; why can’t they advance their defence to court instead of frustrating the trial since 5 years? “The society is watching as one wrong step begets another. We urge you to help protect the integrity of the courts and society. We ask that the Court be allowed to try the matter, to restore the confidence of the society in its system.

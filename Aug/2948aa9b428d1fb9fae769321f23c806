An Australian mum has been sentenced to ten years in prison for dressing her nine-year-old daughter up in a Playboy outfit and letting men rape her repeatedly. The victim who is now 15-years-old was repeatedly molested by her mum’s friends between May 2014 and May 2015. The incidents occurred in the family’s Gold Coast home in Australia, where she would wake up wearing bunny ears and a black lace Playboy costume,” Daily mail reports. Also, it’s been reported that charges were filed after the young girl wrote a note to her psychologist which said her mum used to “come in with friends and touch me improperly.” However, Judge David Kent on Tuesday sentenced the 41-year-old to ten years behind bars. Kent said she was a serious violent offender and will not be eligible for parole until she serves 80% of her sentence. “Your conduct was enabling or aiding others to commit sexual acts on the complainant. “This is extremely serious offence and I am not particularly convinced of prospects of rehabilitation,” he said. He also said the girl had been placed on suicide watch during the trial. “I have to put up with a child who has tried to kill herself three times. “If you think this is some kind of con job, I’m the one paying the joke. If I made some story up then the joke is on me,” the Judge added.

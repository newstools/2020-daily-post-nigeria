The All Progressives Congress (APC) has hit back at former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, for asking President Muhammadu Buhari to apologize to Nigerians over loans the country has taken from China. Atiku, in a statement on Sunday, called the attention of Nigerians on the terms of those loans, which he claims could compromise the future of the country. APC’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, says Atiku does not have the moral right to make such demands, The Nation reports. “This is the person that should apologise to Nigerians. His party plundered the fortunes of the country due to their recklessness. “Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar is not in any position to talk about borrowing and not paying back or apologising to Nigerians on any loan facility taken by this administration. “He should be the one to apologise to Nigerians on how his party, PDP and the administration he served as Vice President took loan for power sector but have nothing to show for it,” Nabena said.

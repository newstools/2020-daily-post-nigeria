Integral Money, who joined the list of young African artists, with their songs played on MTV base top 10 countdowns, said his thoughts on the growth of Afro hip hop is for everyone to understand the tricks of the black sound and spread the work in Africa and beyond. He said his childhood experiences shaped him to be who he is today, adding, “My style of music is different from the regular ones out there. “It’s a blend of Afro hip-hop with strong indigenous vocals. Though I admire all the A-list rappers in Nigeria, Olamide, Reminisce, M.I, Phyno etc, however, I am confident I have an edge especially with the new vibe and unique delivery I will be introducing to the industry. “Growing up in an environment with a peer group that affects you negatively can be discouraging, but I see all that as an inspiration to be better. In Fact, that is part of what built me to who I am today,” he said. The out-spoken Kwara born rapper revealed his plans to un-stage Olamide, Reminisce and M. I as the best Nigerian rappers. Integral Money has also shared a stage with so many artists in Nigeria including, Ycee, Davido, Olamide, Simi, Falz and many others.

National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has commenced nationwide sensitization and preparedness for flood. This followed the warning of looming massive downpour in 28 states. Abdulkadir Ibrahim, Principal Information Officer, NEMA North East, made the announcement in a statement on Thursday. He said the Director-General, AVM Muhammadu Muhammed (rtd), has directed response agencies and other stakeholders to activate mitigation. Muhammed urged them to educate Nigerians on how to respond to flood disasters. Ibrahim disclosed that the North-East zonal office officials already visited Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) camps and host communities in Borno. Early in the month, a flood destroyed 110 houses in Zamfara State after torrential rain.

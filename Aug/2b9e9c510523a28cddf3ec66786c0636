Victor Osimhen grabbed a hat-trick in the first eight minutes as a Napoli player, as they beat L’Aquila 11-0 in a friendly match. The Serie A club began preseason with a mini-tournament against L’Aquila and Castel di Sangro. The first game against Castel di Sangro ended 10-0. Napoli head coach, Gennaro Gattuso, switched up things for the second friendly, starting Hirving Lozano, Dries Mertens and Lorenzo Insigne behind Osimhen. Insigne scored a hat-trick two, while Mertens and Lozano netted twice each. Osimhen moved to the Italian club this summer from Lille.

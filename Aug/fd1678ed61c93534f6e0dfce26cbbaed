The Vice-Chancellor of Kwara State University, Malete, Professor Muhammed Mustapha Akanbi, SAN, on Thursday, appealed to the Federal Government to expedite action on the total reopening of schools nationwide. “The earlier students go back to school, the better, as the public should learn to live with the COVID-19 by complying with safety guidelines,” he stated. Speaking in Ilorin, the Vice-Chancellor said, “Government has taken a bold and good step by allowing some particular sets of students to resume. “Some have been supporting online teaching and examinations, but we can never compare physical learning with virtual online system,” he added. According to him, “The pandemic has posed a challenge to us, it is affecting private universities, some of them are sacking workers presently,” adding that “We are currently at home, because of the COVID-19 and government’s directive. “If you ask me now, I will tell you that universities should be reopened immediately,” he asserted. On the preparation of Kwara State University for resumption, Professor Akanbi said “We are already fumigating our facilities, both in Malete and Ilorin. “We have been doing online lectures for classes with a large number of students’ population. “For those with sizeable numbers, we have made plans to maintain physical distancing of two feet as recommended and also split some into other lecture classes,” he added.

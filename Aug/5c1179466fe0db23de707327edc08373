Big Brother Naija 2020 housemates, Brighto and Kiddwaya were yesterday engaged in discussion about the latter’s sexual escapades with one of the female housemates, Erica, the previous night. Recall that the Lockdown housemate, Erica and Kiddwaya, were on Sunday night caught having sex on different locations in the house. The two lovers started their sex trip from a couch in the lounge and ended up under the duvet on Kiddwaya’s bed. Erica in the viral video was seen under a duvet with Kiddwaya. This has attracted criticisms online. And while Brighto and Kiddwaya were playing an indoor game, the later, who is also called “Evangelist” by viewers, said “You had fun yesterday, man. You have fun!” Seeming surprised, Kiddwaya replied, “Oh last night? You never sleep?” And Brighto explained further, “Of course. Last night. I’m talking about what happened here on that couch. But I no come know wetin happen under your duve. Bad guy!” #Brighto and #Kiddwaya discuss sex with #Erica #BBNaijaLocdown #BBNaijia #bbnaijalockdown2020 pic.twitter.com/fGi8nnu9WS — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 5, 2020

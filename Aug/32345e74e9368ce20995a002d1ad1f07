We count on your utmost professionalism in this regard sir”. Narrating how the incident occurred, Falana said, “Our client was around the vicinity of Secretariat road, Ado Ekiti around 2pm on August 10, 2020, when a motorcyclist approached her that someone requests to buy groundnut, which she sells on the next street. “The motorcyclist offered to convey her to the purported customer, but the biker rode to an unknown place, tricked, threatened and assaulted her and forcefully had carnal knowledge of her after robbing her of her money. “It was some neighbours who heard the shout of our client that broke into the said apartment, got hold of the perpetrator and handed the matter to the police”.

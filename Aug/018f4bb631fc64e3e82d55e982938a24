A sick police officer, a 14-year-old girl and two others have been kidnapped by suspected Fulani herdsmen in Mararaba Rido, Chikun local government area of Kaduna State. They were abducted in the early hours of today, Friday. The Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, chairman Kaduna north local government, Rev. Elisha Abu Dreams, who confirmed this to DAILY POST, said that his house was first attacked by the same suspected kidnappers around 11:57 pm. According to Rev. Abu Dreams, “The suspected kidnappers first came to my house at exactly 11:57pm and they called, spoke in Fulani and Hausa language that l should open the door for them. Immediately, l and my family started praying for divine intervention from God Almighty. “While we were praying and refused to open the entrance to the house, they tried using hammer to break the entrance to the house but could not succeed. While they were making efforts to have their way into the house, we were still praying to God for help. “They later used automatic gun by shooting on the door so that they could gain entrance to the house, yet we were still praying and at the same time, l called on the police to inform them of what we were going through and for their immediate assistance. Before the police personnel could come to the house, they left without gaining entrance to the house.” Rev. Abu Dreams further explained that the suspected kidnappers left to other neighbouring houses, abducted a sick police officer that had just come from another State, a Civil Defence officer, a 14-year-old girl and a security man and went away with them.

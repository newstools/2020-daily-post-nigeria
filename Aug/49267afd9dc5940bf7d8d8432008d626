The West Africa Examinations Council (WAEC) has debunked report of a leaked mathematics examination question paper. DAILY POST reports that WAEC starts its Senior School Certificate Examination, today, Aug. 17 and it will go on till Sept. 7. However, a leaked mathematics question paper circulated on social media, Sunday night. Reacting, WAEC told a concerned Nigerian who alerted them on Twitter that the leaked paper was fake. The Nigerian @iotama22, wrote, “WAEC maths paper scheduled for today has leaked since weekend according to sources. “What kind of a country is this for God’s sake? I hope the people responsible will be investigated and punished as appropriate.” Responding, WAEC said, “This is fake. Scammers do this every year. Only gullible candidates fall prey.”

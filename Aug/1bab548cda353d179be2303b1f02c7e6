Former Anambra Governor, Peter Obi, has condemned the recent killings in Emene, Enugu State. A clash between the Department of States Services (DSS) and Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) a week ago left some persons dead. The DSS confirmed that it lost two operatives. The Biafra agitators too said members were killed, with many currently in detention or missing. On Saturday, Obi stated his position on Twitter. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Vice Presidential Candidate in 2019 demanded a thorough investigation. “The recent killing of unarmed youths in Enugu is condemnable, just as the senseless killing of Nigerians in any part of the country. “I join well-meaning Nigerians in calling for a panel of inquiry to be set up to unravel the circumstances surrounding the killing to avoid such recklessness in the future”, he tweeted.

Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has said he won’t have any problem passing the ball to Cristiano Ronaldo if the Juventus man happens to join Barcelona this summer. Spanish football expert, Guillem Balague, had claimed that the player’s agent, Jorge Mendes, has put his name out there with Barca amongst those contacted. And Spanish outlet, Mundo Deportivo, quoted the Argentine captain as suggesting that he would pass to the Portuguese superstar if they played on the same side. Messi and Ronaldo have had a heated rivalry lasting over a decade on the field. Asked if he would pass to the former Real Madrid goal king, Messi said he would eventually do so. “I guess so, in the end, yes,” Messi said, as quoted by Spanish newspaper, Mundo Deportivo. From their elimination from the Champions League by Lyon, Ronaldo’s future at Juventus has been cast in doubt. Ronaldo, whose contract expires in 2022, has been linked with a move to French Champions, PSG.

Big Brother Naija lockdown housemate, Prince has revealed why he picked Tolanibaj as a love interest over Nengi. Prince, who was the second deputy Head of House of the season, had been in a ‘love triangle with Nengi and Tolanibaj. Prince had shown interest in Tolanibaj, Nengi and Wathoni since he got in the BBNaija house. However, last week he focused his attention on Tolanibaj. Speaking to Erica, Prince disclosed that he did not choose Tolanibaj because he was rejected by Nengi. According to him, Tolanibaj ticked all boxes of the kind of girl he wants in the house and it’s not about the physical. “I’m not always about the physical and I weigh different things before deciding. I chose Tolanibaj, not because I was rejected by Nengi but because she ticked all the boxes I wants in the house,” he said.

The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), has announced that it will not postpone the date of the Edo State governorship election slated for September 19. National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education, Festus Okoye, said the commission will not be disturbed by the threats of violence by political parties and candidates. He added that candidates and parties participating in the election have been warned against compromising the electoral process by inviting violence, the Nation reports. Festus said, “INEC has warned that it will halt the electoral process if the parties resort to violence. “The commission has met over the matter and warned that we will not allow any act of violence. But that does not mean that we are shifting the poll”. The Commission warned that it may have to summon the candidates and their parties for immediate meeting. “We are carefully monitoring what is happening in Edo State and also in Ondo. We will be meeting on Sunday and given the urgency of the situation in Edo State, we may have to immediately call a meeting of not just the candidates and the political parties but also the Campaign Councils,” he added.

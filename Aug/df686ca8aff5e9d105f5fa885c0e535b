The head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, has said the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is awaiting approval from FIFA, for two proposed friendly matches in Austria next month. Rohr, speaking with SportingLife, said approval from the world football governing body, would make it easier to secure the release of players from their clubs. The German also clarified that it was the NFF’s job to secure the release of players, not him. “We are waiting for FIFA’s official decision, if this window in the first week of September is an obligation for the clubs to let go (release) the players we will invite. “So this is not my job. It is an administrative thing. So we are waiting for that. “We have to wait for travelling restrictions to be lifted in all the countries where our players that would be invited are playing,” he said.

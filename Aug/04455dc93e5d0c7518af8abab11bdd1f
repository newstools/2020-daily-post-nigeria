The Action Democratic Party (ADP) has instituted a suit seeking to disqualify the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, from the Edo gubernatorial election. The lawsuit was filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja. ADP is the plaintiff, while the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Ize-Iyamu, his running mate, Audu Abudu Ganiyu and the APC are the defendants. The party alleged that the deputy governorship candidate presented manipulated documents to the INEC. ADP cited the case of disqualification of the Bayelsa Governor-elect, David Lyon, after the Supreme Court ruled that his deputy presented forged credentials. National Publicity Secretary, Adelaja Adeoye, told newsmen on Sunday: “This is a serious matter, and ADP will ensure justice is served appropriately.” “For good governance and good leaders, those contesting elections must present authentic qualifications as required by INEC. Anything contrary must be challenged at the court.” ADP said: “The Deputy Governorship candidate of the APC who goes by the name AUDU ABUDU GANIYU presented to the INEC a Voter’s Card which bears the name AUDU ABDUL GANIYU. “He also presented a WASSCE/GCE certificate bearing the name AUDU AHUDU GANEYU to the INEC. Again, the Deputy Governorship candidate presented to the INEC an APC membership card bearing the name AUDU GANI.” The party prayed the court to interpret the certificates and declare that the Deputy Governorship candidate of the APC has presented forged certificates to INEC. This, it observed, violates Section 182(1)(j) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended). The plaintiff seeks an order compelling INEC to remove Ize-Iyamu, Audu and the APC, from its list of candidates and parties eligible to contest.

The Federal Government has said it will support the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration Control (NAFDAC) on researches for coronavirus vaccine. Health Minister, Osagie Ehanire, spoke at the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 joint briefing on Thursday in Abuja. He said Nigeria participated in a World Health Organization (WHO), African Regional Conference, held virtually and chaired by the Minister of Health of the Congo. The conference centered on COVID-19 vaccines and implementing the African region sickle cell strategy. The minister assured that Nigeria will sustain interest in vaccine development and liaise with countries and organizations investing in new knowledge. “NAFDAC is trying to reach the maturity level to assure that the processes and products that come out of research work in Nigeria are realizable and that they meet the required standard. “Our safest, easiest and cheapest option of achieving a balance between saving livelihood and saving lives remains adherence to non-pharmaceutical measures, as we have preached so many times.” Ehanire appealed to Nigerians not to relax in observing the COVID-19 preventive measures. He warned that coronavirus would remain for the foreseeable future until a vaccine is available.

Ebonyi State Government has ordered members of the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria (JUSUN) to suspend their industrial action or be sacked. The workers commenced the strike on August 13. They are protesting the non-implementation of the Consolidated Judiciary Salary Structure (CJSS). In a statement on Friday, Chamberlain Nwele, Ebonyi Head of Service, warned them of non-payment of salary. “JUSUN members are directed to return to work on Friday, Aug. 14 or risk being dismissed from service. Attendance of judiciary staff will be taken by state government officials, to aid payment of August 2020 salary,” it read. Nwele said Governor David Umahi considers the strike as an act of sabotage which the government will not tolerate. “This is a period when other states of the federation are unable to pay workers’ salaries due to the negative impact of COVID-19.” The official added that the state has ensured that salaries are paid despite the pandemic. The government called the agitation for salary increase at a time the state’s revenue is on steady decline “unpatriotic”.

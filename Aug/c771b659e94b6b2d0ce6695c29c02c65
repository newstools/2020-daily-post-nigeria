Manchester United have held last-minute talks with Lille defender, Gabriel Magalhaes, despite claims the player has been booked for an Arsenal medical. According to Sky Sports, the Red Devils have made a move to hijack the Brazilian from under their Premier League rivals. United are yet to make a concrete bid for Magalhaes, but are monitoring the 22-year-oldâ€™s situation. Ole Gunnar Solskhjaer is in the market for a left-sided centre half and is exploring his options in the market. It now appears Magalhaes will play in England next season, whether that is London or Manchester. Magalhaes was a key member of the Lille team that finished fourth in Ligue 1 last season and reportedly undertook a medical with Everton ahead of the COVID-19 lockdown.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Sunday said people of Edo State have chosen its governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu as its next governor. APC’s Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena made the remark in response to the large turnout of people witnessed during the flag-off of its governorship campaign, on Saturday. Nabena said the massive turnout was an indication that Edo State would return to APC. In a statement, Nabena also thanked the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II for the reception accorded APC campaign team. According to Nabena: “The All Progressives Congress (APC) is deeply humbled by the massive turnout, and support the good people of Edo state extended to the Party’s National Campaign Council during Saturday’s campaign flagoff of our governorship candidate, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu and running mate, Gani Audu ahead of the September 19 governorship election in the state. “The Edo electorate have sent a clear message on the governance direction of the state – a progressive one which puts the people’s welfare and interests first. As a party, we don’t take this overwhelming support for granted. “We particularly thank the Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II for the very warm reception and hospitality His Royal Highness extended to our party leaders during the courtesy visit to the Palace. We pray the Almighty God continues to grant the revered Oba of Benin the wisdom to guide the good people of Edo state on the right and progressive path. “We stand with the good people of Edo state that votes must count and the will of the Edo electorate must prevail.”

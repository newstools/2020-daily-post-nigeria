Lionel Messi’s former Argentina team-mate, Gonzalo Higuain, has warned him not to consider a move to the Premier League, because defenders in England “kick the s*** out of you”. Messi’s future at Camp Nou remains uncertain and the 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League, has only increased talk he could be on his way out. Ronald Koeman is expected to replace Quique Setien as manager and it remains to be seen if a new man in charge can convince Messi to stay. However, Higuain has advised Messi not to consider a move to the Premier League. The 32-year-old spent the second half of the 2018/2019 season on loan at Chelsea, but he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge, scoring five goals in 18 appearances. Higuain told Marca: “England? Over there defenders kick the shit out of you and nothing gets given [by referees]. “They’re built like wardrobes and they hit you. I suffered a lot in the English league. I did not manage to adapt in six months. It has nothing to do with the Spanish League. “I don’t know how it could impact Leo, but being a player of another level I don’t think he would suffer, but it’s a very complicated league.”

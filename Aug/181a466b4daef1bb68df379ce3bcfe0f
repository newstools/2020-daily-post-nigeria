The Presidency has taken a swipe on Nigerians criticising the invitation of former Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Deputy Governor, Obadiah Mailafia by the Department of State Services, DSS over his recent comments on Boko Haram. Appearing on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Wednesday, Garba Shehu, the President Muhammadu Buhari’s Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, said the DSS took the right decision. Shehu pointed out that this was not the first time the secret police was inviting people for questioning, adding that Nigeria is not Mali. “This is Nigeria; this is not Mali … Is this the first time the Department of State Service is inviting people for questioning?” He asked. “When somebody claiming to be a responsible citizen makes such a claim as Obadiah Mailafia did, saying that a governor is a commander for Boko Haram and he shouldn’t be asked questions, so what kind of society do we want?” the President’s aide asked. The DSS has had Obadiah questioned for at least two times over his claims on a radio programme that the insurgents in the North East were enjoying the support of some governors. Garba Shehu said that Nigerians go to the United Kingdom, America and other countries to obey the laws there but come back home to find adhering to the rule of law difficult. “We are living in a country of people who will go to the UK and America and obey all the laws and in our country, when there is enforcement, they start crying… so, what is political about it?” He added. He said the fine for hate speech should be increased from N500,000 because, according to him, people can easily pay the current amount. “As for the increase in the charge against hate speech, perhaps it’s the assessment of the minister,” Shehu said. He added, “The N500,000 that was emplaced was not being respected, it was not effective in curtailing these things because somebody picking rumour and is going to the radio to announce that … come on, what are we dealing with?”

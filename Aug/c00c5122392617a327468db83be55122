Juventus new manager, Andrea Pirlo, is reportedly ready to sell at least six players this summer transfer window, as he looks to bolster his squad ahead of next season, Mirror UK reports. Pirlo was appointed as Juventus new manager over the weekend following the sacking of Maurizio Sarri. Juventus have seen their revenue streams hit hard because of the coronavirus pandemic and will have less money to spend this summer following their Champions League exit at the hands of Lyon. Pirlo has put Aaron Ramsey “among six players” he wants Juventus to sell this summer. Ramsey only moved to the Old Lady last year, but the Welsh international is not wanted by Pirlo, and he is free to find another club this summer. The former Arsenal star is now seen as surplus to requirements under the new regime. Other players Pirlo wants to offload are Sami Khedira, Gonzalo Higuain, Daniele Rugani and Mattia De Sciglio. Meanwhile, Pirlo’s former teammate, Luca Toni, has urged the Juventus coach to sign Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba this summer.

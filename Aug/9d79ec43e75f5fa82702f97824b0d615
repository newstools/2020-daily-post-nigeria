Former Arsenal star, Paul Merson, has urged Arsenal to complete the signing of Gabriel Magalhaes from French Ligue 1 side, Lille. Magalhaes had drawn the interest of Arsenal in the past few days. The Brazilian defender reportedly agreed to a five-year contract with the Gunners. But Merson believes it will be a “big statement” from Arsenal if they complete a deal for Magalhaes because a number of teams from across Europe have expressed interest in signing the defender. “If Arsenal sign Gabriel Magalhaes I think it’s a big statement because of all the other clubs that were after him,” Merson told Starsport. “If Arsenal have managed to get him in without having Champions League football to offer, I think that is huge. “I like what Mikel Arteta is doing. But there are plenty of teams around them getting better as well. “Chelsea have bought amazingly well. They’re going to close the gap on Liverpool next season. “It could be one of the tightest league title races in a long time. But Arsenal have a long way to go to get to that level.”

A 48 years old married man, Ben Mbanefo, may be charged to court for allegedly defiling a 10-year- old girl in Ejigbo, Lagos. Mbanefo was said to have lured the little girl, his neighbour’s ward, into his apartment and engaged her in sex. He was subsequently arrested by the Police operatives from Ejigbo Division following the report of the incident at the police station. The Divisional Police Officer (DPO), CSP Olabisi Okuwobi, said the suspect has been transferred to the Gender Section of Area D Command in Mushin, Lagos for further investigation and prosecution. The incident was said to have happened at Taiwo Street, Ejigbo, where they reside. It was gathered that the little girl had visited her aunt to spend COVID-19 lockdown holiday with her. The police said: “The suspect’s wife had gone to work and the victim was playing with other children in his house. Mbanefo deliberately sent all the children away from his apartment and called the 10-year old girl back to send her on an errand. “When the girl went back to his house, he took her to his matrimonial bed, removed her underwear and had carnal knowledge of her before he allowed her to go. “The dubious act was exposed after the little girl complained of stomach upset and started vomiting. It was then she revealed that the suspect, Mbanefo, had engaged her in sex. “She was taken to the hospital, where she was being treated while the matter was reported to the Police and he was arrested for interrogation.”

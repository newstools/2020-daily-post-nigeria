The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has claimed his prophecy on the health of Aisha Buhari, Nigeria’s First Lady, has come to fulfillment. He also claimed to have prophesied the political crisis going on in Edo State ahead of the forthcoming election. Primate Ayodele recalled that he had many months ago issued a prophecy that Obaseki will become victorious in the coming election except there is manipulation in the election. “I even like (former National Chairman of the APC, Adams) Oshiomhole than Obaseki and I don’t pity Obaseki, but Oshiomhole will not be the one to give the next governor to the people of Edo State. “I’m only saying what the Lord is telling me to say. Anyone who rigs will die of COVID-19. Obaseki should wake up. “He will win without manipulation and rigging,” he had said. In a statement to DAILY POST on Saturday, he said the recent happening in the state has confirmed that the APC and its members are jittery over the prophecy and wants to ensure Obaseki is frustrated. “Several manipulations have been recorded which includes assembly members trying to impeach the governor, some members of his cabinet resigning, a deliberate and intentional move to oust him from the race,” he added. Ayodele said he had, a few weeks ago, also called on the Aso rock officials to pay special attention to President Buhari and Aisha Buhari’s health. “It’s still in the Villa. Aisha should wake up. Buhari will cry again, if care isn’t taken. Someone will still die in the Villa. “The President and his wife should be paid more attention,” he had said. The cleric made the claim following reports yesterday that Aisha Buhari has been flown out of the country for treatment.

Former Premier League star, Charlie Nicholas, has predicted that Manchester City could beat Real Madrid 3-2 in today’s Champions League round of 16 second-leg fixture at Etihad Stadium. Pep Guardiola’s side head to the game after beating Los Blancos 2-1 in the first-leg at the Santiago Bernabeu back in February. Providing his prediction, Nicholas told Sky Sports: “For the last ten days or so, Pep will have been working on shape, especially with Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and then Bernardo Silva or Riyad Mahrez. “This tie is far from over, and Madrid can come back and hurt you big time as we have seen before. “Pep [Guardiola] knows how to get Real on the wrong foot, and I think he will prove that again. “I’m looking at a five-goal thriller. This is the build-up to a real exciting Champions League campaign. “Madrid will go for it and City can and will pick them off. Man City 3, Real Madrid 2.” The match kick-off time is scheduled for 8 pm.

Erica: “If I win Head of House (HOH), I don’t know who I’d pick. I know the answer is obvious but it’s too dangerous to pick Kiddwaya. Dorathy responding said: “Ordinary garden that both of you are already doing like this. Wonder what will happen. “Why don’t they have window where we can peep in?” Erica, again responding while laughing said: “You guys wanna watch porn?” Recall that Erica and Kiddwaya were seen allegedly having sex on Sunday night and have been seen kissing in different locations in BBNaija house.

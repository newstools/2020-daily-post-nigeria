Borno State Governor, Babagana Zulum, on Thursday received the new Army commander in Borno. The state government made the announcement on Facebook. “Zulum received the new Garrison Commander 7 Division, Nigerian Army. He was accompanied by the outgoing Garrison Commander, Brigadier General Sunday Igbinomwanhia”, it read. “The Governor has presented a souvenir to the outgoing Garrison Commander, Brigadier General Sunday Igbinomwanhia in appreciation of his service to Borno State.” The development came days after Zulum sent an SOS on the security situation in Borno State to President Muhammadu Buhari. Zulum insisted that there was sabotage in the system.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-825484" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200806_141309.jpg" alt="" width="714" height="606" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200806_141309.jpg 714w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/20200806_141309-300x255.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 714px) 100vw, 714px"> He warned that this was forestalling the defeat of Boko Haram. Zulum spoke on Sunday when his counterparts from Kebbi and Jigawa, Atiku Bagudu and Badaru Abubakar, paid him a visit after the Baga attack. “I earlier said that the gravity of the insurgency cannot be compared with what has happened between 2011 to 2015, and 2015 to date.” Noting that Buhari has done well, the governor declared: “But there’s sabotage in the system that will not allow insurgency to end.”

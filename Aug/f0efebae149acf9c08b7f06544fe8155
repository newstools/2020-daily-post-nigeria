The Delta State Police Command has arrested eleven suspected kidnappers. The Police also recovered one firearm and some rounds of ammunition with eleven mobile phones from the suspects. The Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Mohammed Hafiz Inuwa disclosed this in a telephone chat with Our Correspondent in Warri on Sunday. The State Police boss said the suspects were arrested separately by Policemen on routine “stop and search duties.” According to CP Inuwa, “We have arrested 11 kidnappers. They kidnapped somebody and dispossessed him of his SUV. They were intercepted by our men and two were arrested. The two led to the arrests of nine others in Oghara, Mosogar, Jesse and Sapele communities in Ethiope-West and Sapele Local Government Areas of Delta State.” He said the suspected kidnappers have been troubling and disturbing the police in the areas mentioned above. While expressing delight that the Policemen were able to match the syndicate, CP Inuwa commended his men for doing a great job just as he urged them to intensify efforts in ridding the area of all criminal elements.

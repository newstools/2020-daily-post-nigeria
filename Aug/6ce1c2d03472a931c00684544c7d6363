Big Brother Naija housemate, Prince has hinted on aborting his relationship plans with Nengi if she keeps switching between him and Ozo. Prince has shown viewers he has strong feelings for Nengi but has also been seen making moves at Wathoni too. However, speaking with Laycon and Trikytee on Tuesday night, Prince said he would stop being close to Nengi if she does not stop switching between him and Ozo. Nengi seems to be getting closer to the male housemates in the house, especially Prince and Ozo despite making it known publicly that she has a boyfriend outside the show. Prince said: “I’ll tell Nengi to stay away from me if she keeps on switching between I and Ozo. “I’m presently vibing with Nengi, but today she’s vibing with me, tomorrow she’s vibing with ozo “By the end of this week she’s still doing all of that I’ll just tell her to stay on her own it does not make sense. “If she stays one place too I’ll make my final decision.” Video: Prince : i’m vibing with nengi but nw 2moro she’s vibing with Ozo. If by d end of d week,she’s still switching between myself and Ozo, I’ll tell her to stay away frm me. I can’t do that sh*t, it doesn’t make sense. 😂

The Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed, on Wednesday, presented a letter of reinstatement as Wazirin Bauchi from Bauchi Emirate Council to Alhaji Bello Kirfi. Kirfi, who served as Minister of Special Duties during the regime of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, was suspended as the Wazirin Bauchi by the Emir of Bauchi, Dr Rilwanu Suleimanu Adamu, about three years ago. A statement made available to DAILY POST by the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Mohammed on Media and Publicity, Muktar Gidado, informed that the governor presented the letter of reinstatement to Alhaji Kirfi at his residence in Bauchi and expressed gratitude to the Emir for the gesture. Governor Mohammed, according to Gidado, explained that lifting of the suspension followed intervention and wider consultations with critical stakeholders and the Emirate in particular. The governor applauded the elder statesman for his patriotism, commitment and sportsmanship especially his efforts in the protection of the rights of Bauchi indigenes and Nigerians in general. “I am here with my deputy and other top government officials to pay you this auspicious visit to present you a message from the Emir of Bauchi, His Royal Highness, Dr Rilwanu Suleimanu Adamu. “On behalf of the government and people of Bauchi State, all traditional leaders, it is my honour and privilege to present you with your letter of reinstatement as Wazirin Bauchi by the Emir of Bauchi. “Alhamdulillah, I am so much happy that the reinstatement came under my tenure,” the governor’s aide quoted Governor Mohammed as saying. The governor, therefore, felicitated with the elder statesman over his reinstatement as Wazirin Bauchi, describing it as a good development to the entire people of the state. Responding, Kirfi thanked the governor for his intervention and leadership and the entire people of Bauchi State for their support and understanding.

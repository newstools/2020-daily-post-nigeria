Chelsea defender, Antonio Rudiger, has paid tribute to teammate, Willian, amid interest from Arsenal for the Brazilian international. Willian looks set to leave Chelsea this summer with his contract expiring this month. The 31-year-old winger, who has been linked with a move to Arsenal, recently rejected Chelsea’s latest offer to sign a new two-year contract at Stamford Bridge. But Rudiger has admitted it will be “sad” if Willian leaves Frank Lampard’s side, adding that the former Shakhtar Donetsk star is a good footballer just like Chelsea legend, Eden Hazard. “Since day one of coming to Chelsea, Willian and David Luiz got me into the team and helped me out in the first couple of months because it was not that easy,” Rudiger was quoted by talkSport as saying. “Willian is a great guy and a really, really good footballer. He’s calm and humble, and it will be sad if I do not see him again as a teammate. He’s not the type of player who talks that much. “He does his thing on the pitch, just like Eden Hazard. By playing, he shows what he’s about. “He’s a guy who dictates the game and not many players in the world have this type of quality. “He’s always training [hard] and practising free-kicks after. He’s someone who always wants to improve.”

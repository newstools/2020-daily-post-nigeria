Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has said he will meet with the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 next week, to review the 10pm to 4am curfew. The curfew was imposed to restrict movement across the country, in a bid to contain the spread of Coronavirus. However, Sanwo-Olu speaking at a media briefing at the State House today, said he spoke with the PTF in the coming days about it, but noted it was a national regulation. “The 10pm (to 4am) curfew is still on. It is a national regulation and it was issued by the PTF (Presidential Task Force on Covid-19). We will be having a discussion with the PTF during the week and if we have additional information, we will be passing across. “This is a decision that was taken by the President himself. It is a national issue, so, the curfew is still on. And we still need to comply with the Federal Government directives,” he said.

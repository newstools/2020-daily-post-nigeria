Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has called on the Nigeria Police to call the supporters of the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP to order over attacks on the members of the All Progressives Congress, APC in Akure, the Ondo State capital. According to Akeredolu, violence on the part of the PDP will no longer be tolerated in the state under any guise. The governor who spoke through the Spokesperson, Akeredolu/Aiyedatiwa Campaign Organisation, Olabode Richard Olatunde emphasized that members of the APC and supporters of Akeredolu have been subjected to unprovoked attacks from hoodlums allegedly loyal to Jegede. It was also alleged that thugs have been harassing and attacking anyone on branded caps and T-shirts bearing the APC logo and Governor Akeredolu‘s name. “We have observed with dismay, an ugly trend ahead of the October 10, 2020 governorship election and wish to alert the good people of Ondo State and relevant security agencies. “Innocent members of the APC who were going about their personal routine were rounded up at Odopetu in Akure by PDP thugs who inflicted bodily harm on them and removed their branded caps and T-shirts bearing the name of Governor Akeredolu and APC logo.” He added that the unprovoked attacks was a direct affront on the peaceful resolve of the APC-led government in the state, stressing that no one has a monopoly of violence. “We are calling on the security agents to call the PDP to order as the people of the state will no longer tolerate any act of intimidation and harassment from the drowning PDP. “We, therefore, warn the PDP not to take the political maturity of the APC and its candidate, Governor Akeredolu for granted or be misconstrued as a sign of weakness.”

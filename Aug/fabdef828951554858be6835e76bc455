Kebbi State Government has taken over the responsibility of an abandoned child who was rescued by a human rights group. The 10-year-old Jamilu Aliyu was chained in the stall of goats for two years. Aliyu Argungu, New Media Assistant to the governor, in a statement on Tuesday said the boy’s ordeal started after he lost his biological mother. He revealed that Aliyu was mostly denied food and resorted to feeding upon the food given to the animals he was staying with. “Sometimes, he ate his own faeces for survival. He emaciated, dehydrated and partially deformed. He limps like an ape and behaves like animals.” The aide added that Aliyu is at the Yahaya Specialist Hospital Birnin Kebbi and responding to treatment. His father, Aliyu Badariya, and stepmothers are in police custody. The government vowed that they will face the full wrath of the law. The statement announced that Governor Atiku Bagudu has submitted a bill to the House of Assembly for protection of victims and penalties for such offences.

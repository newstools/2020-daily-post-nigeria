Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya has disclosed that his billionaire father, Terry Waya was the one who bailed the late Diepreye Alamieyeseigha from UK prison. Kiddwaya said this on Thursday during his wager task, which was a tribute to his father. This is contrary to reports that Alamieyeseigha allegedly jumped bail in December 2005 from the United Kingdom by allegedly disguising himself as a woman. The former Governor of Bayelsa State was detained in 2005 on the charges of money laundering after Metropolitan Police found about £1m in cash in his London home and a total of £1.8m ($3.2m) in cash and bank accounts. Kiddwaya, speaking about his admiration for his father, said “My father was the one who bailed the late Chief D.S.P Alamieyeseigha of Bayelsa State out of prison back then. “He has everybody’s back and he’s loyal to you no matter what. But he does not expect anything in return from anyone. Alamieyeseigha was impeached on allegations of corruption on 9 December 2005. He was the governor of Bayelsa state from May 1999 to December 2005 when he was impeached for corruption charges. Many of his assets were ordered to be forfeited to the Bayelsa state government. On July 26, 2007, Alamieyeseigha pleaded guilty in court to six charges and was sentenced to two years in prison on each charge. However, before his death in 2015, Alamieyeseigha said he only pleaded guilty due to his age and would have fought the charges if he was younger.

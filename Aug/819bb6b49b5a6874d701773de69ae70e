Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Praise, on Saturday night accused Dorathy of lying about her feelings for Brighto. Dorathy had told Wathoni that she has no true feelings for Brighto but just lust. However, Praise in a conversation with Dorathy, told her to let Brighto know about her feelings. According to him, Dorathy is lying to herself about her feelings for Brighto. He said: “Stop lying to yourself, is it because someone else is trying to have things with him.” Dorathy responded admitting she’s lying about her intentions but does not want a distraction. Also, Prince who joined the conversation advised Dorathy to stop seeing a relationship with Brighto as a distraction and make her intentions known. There is a recent love triangle between Dorathy- Brighto-Wathoni in the house. Meanwhile, Brighto has said he is not interested in having any relationship in the house because he wants his space.

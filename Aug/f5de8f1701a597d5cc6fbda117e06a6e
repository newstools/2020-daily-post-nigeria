Lebanon’s prime minister, Hassan Diab, and the country’s entire government have resigned following the devastating Beirut explosion which has killed at least 160 people and left more than 6,000 injured. Speaking during a brief televised speech, PM Diab said that the explosion that rocked Beirut last week was caused by “endemic corruption” and called for trial on those responsible for the deadly blast. “I declare today the resignation of this government. May God protect Lebanon. “ I am taking “a step back” to stand with the people and fight the battle for change alongside them,” he said. The prime minister also blamed corrupt politicians who preceded him for the “earthquake” that has hit Lebanon. “They should have been ashamed of themselves because their corruption is what has led to this disaster that had been hidden for seven years. “Today we follow the will of the people in their demand to hold accountable those responsible for the disaster that has been in hiding for seven years, and their desire for real change. “In the face of this reality I am announcing today the resignation of this government,” he added. Recall that the massive explosion rocked Lebanese capital Beirut on Tuesday killing dozens and injuring thousands of people. The explosion also destroyed so many buildings and vehicles.

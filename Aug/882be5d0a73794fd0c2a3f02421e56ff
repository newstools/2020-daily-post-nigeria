Nigerian music star, Augustine Kelechi, popularly known by his stage name as Tekno has blasted Nigerian leaders stealing from the national purse. Tekno in a post on Monday afternoon said those leaders stealing and not giving back, no matter how little, will suffer. According to him, they would suffer in ways money can’t solve. The singer made this known on his Twitter page. His tweet read: “If you are a leader in this country stealing from your people and just can’t give back small to the people. “God will make you suffer in ways money cannot fix.” Just a few days ago, Mavin Producer, Don Jazzy lamented about how deep corruption has eaten deep into Nigeria‘s economy. Making reference to the probe of NDDC, Don Jazzy said corruption has become so endemic in Nigeria that huge public funds are pilfered with reckless abandon. He also wondered if Ken Saro-Wiwa who lost his life for the region’s course would be proud of how things turned around.

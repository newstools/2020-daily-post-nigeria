Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has denied he is plotting to return to the position. Oshiomhole stated this on Monday while addressing State House Correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Aso Rock Villa, Abuja. He was reacting to recent remarks made by Director-General of the Progressives Congress Forum (PGF), Salihu Lukman, that he was scheming to return to helm of the ruling party. Oshiomhole insisted he would not “resit” a class he had passed and said only “an empty brain” would suggest that he is eyeing a comeback. The former Edo State Governor said: “You see, what I want the media to interrogate, how does winning Edo…when I was removed as national chairman, Edo was APC. So do I have to win Edo to become the chairman? Do I look so unemployed? I’m 68. “So, what they don’t understand is that it is not the office of chairman that made me who I am. “So, it takes an empty brain to suggest that Oshiomhole wants to stage a comeback to become the national chairman. For what? To go and do a resit?”

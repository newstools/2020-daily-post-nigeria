Emmanuel Uduaghan, a former governor of Delta State, has refuted claims that he benefited from contracts of the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. Uduaghan described the allegation by the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godwill Akpabio, linking him to NDDC’s contracts as false. Akpabio had named Uduaghan as one of those who benefited from the NDDC contracts. However, a statement by the former governor’s media aide, Monoyo Edon, stressed that Uduaghan never got any contract from the NDDC. The former Delta State governor called on Nigerians to disregard the claims by the minister, The statement read in parst: “We want to state very clearly that the said accusation is false. Dr. Uduaghan has never approached the NDDC for any contract whatsoever. “It is even more ridiculous that the said contract is a road inside Port Harcourt town. “Dr. Uduaghan has drawn the attention of the Hon. Minister of the Niger Delta, Sen Godswill Akpabio to the publication and hopes he makes a correction.”

The starting XIs for the Bayern Munich vs Chelsea game this night have been confirmed. The Blues go into the Champions League last-16 second leg 3-0 down and an injury-ravaged squad. It has left Frank Lampard with some of his first-team regulars unavailable and an impossible task to achieve at the Allianz Arena. Lampard picks Tammy Abraham, Mason Mount and Callum Hudson-Odoi upfront, while Nâ€™Golo Kante makes a return. The Bundesliga champions have named a strong team, with Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Muller and Serge Gnabry in attack. Bayern XI: Neuer, Kimmich, Boateng, Alaba, Davies, Goretzka, Alcantara, Gnabry, Muller, Perisic, Lewandowski. Chelsea XI: Caballero, James, Christensen, Zouma, Emerson, Kante, Kovacic, Barkley, Mount, Abraham, Hudson-Odoi.

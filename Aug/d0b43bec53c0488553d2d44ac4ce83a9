Cristiano Ronaldo’s camp has played down claims he could move to Barcelona this summer. Spanish football expert, Guillem Balague, had claimed that the player’s agent, Jorge Mendes, has put his name out there with Barca amongst those contacted. Balague said Ronaldo could leave Juve after only two seasons, with the club trying to get his £28m-per-year salary off their books. The speculation led to excitement among fans over a potential link-up between Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. But according to AS, Ronaldo’s camp have rubbished those rumours and claimed the Portugal captain and his family are “very happy” in Turin. They also made it clear he is not looking to leave the Italian champions, with his current deal set to run until 2022. Ronaldo, 33, is eyeing a sixth Champions League crown with Juventus and will be working under Andrea Pirlo who replaced Maurizio Sarri as manager last week.

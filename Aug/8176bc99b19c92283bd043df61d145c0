Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya has revealed how his father treats him. Kiddwaya, who is the son of billionaire businessman, Terry Waya, said he never got much love from his father. Speaking with fellow housemate, on Saturday morning, Kiddwaya said his Benue-born father only gives him money and not love. According to the former Head of House, “I didn’t get much love from home, my dad only gives money.” Recall that the BBNaija housemate had boasted that no housemate’s net worth was close to his own. “Nobody compares. They don’t compare to me, not like am bragging or something but, my NET-WORTH, my bank account don’t compare to them,” Kiddwaya had told Erica.

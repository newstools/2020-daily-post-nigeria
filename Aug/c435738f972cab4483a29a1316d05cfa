Freddie Ljungberg has left his role at Arsenal as Mikel Arteta’s assistant. Arsenal made the announcement in a statement via the club’s official website on Sunday. The statement read in part: “Freddie Ljungberg is leaving the club to pursue new opportunities in the coming season. “Freddie, currently the assistant coach to Mikel Arteta, has been back with us for the past two seasons after returning from Germany where he was assistant manager at VfL Wolfsburg. Freddie has previously led our under-15 and under-23 squads.” Reacting, Freddie said: “I have decided to leave my first-team assistant coaching role at Arsenal to progress my management experience. “I have been involved with this club on and off since 1998 and am grateful for all the opportunities they have given me both as a player and as a coach.” “I wish Mikel and all the team every success for the season ahead. Thanks also to the fans for their constant support and for always being by my side. I hope we will all meet again soon.” Also reacting, Arteta said: “Freddie has been a really important member of my team since my arrival. “He did a great job picking the team up when Unai left and we all have 100 per cent respect for him as a man and a coach. I know I’ll be facing him on the touchline in the future.”

Big Brother Naija 2020 housemate, Ka3na, has been evicted from the “Lockdown” edition. Four housemates; Lilo, Eric, Praise and Ka3na scored the least votes from fans. However, the housemates got the opportunity to decide who would be sent home out of the four housemates with the lowest votes. At the end of the selection, Ka3na got the highest nomination from housemates. Recall that Ka3na was caught having sex with Praise in the house last week. DAILY POST recalls that the host of BBNaija, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, confirmed all the housemates would continue to be up for possible eviction. Biggie in a twist to the reality show this year, announced that all housemates except head of house and deputy will be up for eviction every week for the duration of 10 weeks.

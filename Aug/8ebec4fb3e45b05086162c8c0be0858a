Barcelona have sacked their manager, Quique Setién, after their exit from the Champions League following their 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich last Friday. The Catalan club also provided an update on Setien’s replacement. Barcelona made the announcement in a statement via the club’s official Twitter handle on Monday. “Quique Setién no longer first team coach,” Barcelona tweeted “The new coach will be announced in the coming days as part of a wide-ranging restructuring of the first team.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he is eager to win his first trophy with the club. After securing a Champions League ticket on the final day of the season, United resume their Europa League campaign against LASK on Wednesday. Solskjaer’s men hold a 5-0 lead from the first leg played in Austria before the COVID-19 lockdown. United are all but assured of a place in the mini-tournament to be held in Germany and Solskajer admits it represents a good chance to land the first trophy of his reign. “As a coach, I won the league the first time with Molde – first time for the club in their 100-year history – and since then they have won it four times in eight or nine years. “It was a big change in that club and for me if we can get our hands on a trophy it’s a big step forward,” he told a press conference on Tuesday.

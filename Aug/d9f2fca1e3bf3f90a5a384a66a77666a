With two months to the Ondo State governorship election, political fireworks have begun to heat up in the state. This is just as the immediate past governor of the state Dr. Olusegun Mimiko threw a jab at his successor, the incumbent governor of the state, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. Mimiko over the weekend described Akeredolu as an unprogressive governor who neglected the people-oriented programmes and policies he left behind during his tenure. Mimiko who is the National leader of Zenith Labour Party, ZLP stated this while receiving Akeredolu’s deputy, Hon Agboola Ajayi, at his Ondo town residence in Ondo West Local Government Area of the state. The ex-governor maintained that any party or government that would not meet the needs of the masses at the point of their yearnings was not a progressive one, adding that ZLP was the only party with a human face. While lauding the Deputy governor for joining forces with ZLP, Mimiko said Ajayi is a well-groomed and seasoned politician. Recall that Ajayi had on Friday officially declared for ZLP where he will be flying the party’s flag on October 10, 2020, after his name was substituted for the party standard-bearer, Rotimi Benjamin. Meanwhile, the state government has described Mimiko’s allegation as a ploy to manipulate the minds of his supporters. According to the Ondo Commissioner for Information, Donald Ojogo “We can only sympathise with him because he has come out to remind the people of Ondo State and as well reactivate their consciousness of his almost forgotten past. No one without any treacherous content can market a treacherous product.”

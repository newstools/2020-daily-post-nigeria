Ajax midfielder, Donny van de Beek, has opened up to his teammates that he wants to leave the club for Manchester United this summer. Van de Beek has been heavily linked with a move to the Premier League giants in recent weeks. The 23-year-old missed Ajax’s 2-1 friendly win against Frankfurt on Saturday and also their 2-2 draw against Union Berlin on Sunday. According to Spanish outlet, Diario Sport, Van de Beek has confided in some of his closest friends in the Ajax dressing room, telling them of his intention to join Man United this summer. The Dutch international has already said goodbye to his colleagues and will become a Man United player in the coming days. Man United coach, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who is a huge admirer of Van de Beek, wants the player to help turn the Red Devils into Premier League contenders. Van de Beek is expected to cost around £40million and will become Man United’s first summer signing.

The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has warned that Kano-based musician, Yahaya Sharif-Aminu, should not be killed. According to him, killing the singer will amount to spilling blood of the innocent. The Kano-based singer was recently sentenced to death by an Upper Sharia Court for blaspheming Prophet Mohammed. The 22-year-old Kano singer, was, however, given an option to appeal the ruling or he will die by hanging. Primate Ayodele, in a statement to DAILY POST on Friday, cautioned against killing of the talented youngster. He made it known that religion preaches love and tolerance, and killing Yahaya Shariff does not follow what religion preaches. He made reference to Boko Haram members that were granted amnesty, noting that they equally deserved death because they have killed several Nigerians yet they were pardoned. ‘‘If they should kill that young boy, they would be spilling an innocent blood. Insurgency is one of the problems in the north, Boko haram has been killing lots of them yet when Boko Haram members were captured, they were granted amnesty, that boy has done nothing that warrants him being condemned to death. “I’m not poke-nosing into their religion but I believe every religion preaches love and tolerance, if Yahaya Shariff is killed because of blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed, where is the place of religion that preaches love and tolerance? “The same tolerance employed in the case of Boko Haram insurgence should also be employed here.”

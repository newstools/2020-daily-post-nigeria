Former Arsenal Director of Football, Raul Sanllehi, has spoken for the first time since he left the club officially on Saturday. Sanllehi is believed to have been sacked, amid investigation into the £72million deal that saw Nicolas Pepe arrive at the club last year. https://dailypost.ng/2020/08/14/arsenal-open-investigation-into-72m-club-paid-for-nicolas-pepe/ The Premier League club paid £20m up front and will spread the £52m balance over the next five years, the first instalment of which is due this summer. This has led a review of the scouting reports and negotiating process which led to such a big deal being sanctioned. However, in a statement, the Sanllehi insists “there is no one to blame for this, other than COVID-19, and the need to adapt and remodel the club’s structure to the new times.” He also vowed that “I will continue a Gooner for the rest of my days, and I will be celebrating every goal and every title they (WE) achieve in the coming years.”

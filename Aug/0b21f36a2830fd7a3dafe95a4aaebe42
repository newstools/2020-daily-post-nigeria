A fake lawyer, Adedeji Ebenezer Oluwagbenga, has bagged three years jail-term in Ogun State. Oluwagbenga, the police said, was arrested on August 5 at Itori Chief Magistrate Court, where he was appearing for a client. A statement by the Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Thursday, said the convict was arraigned before Chief magistrate B.A Somorin on one count charge of unlawful and illegal appearance as a lawyer knowing full well that he is not. Oyeyemi said Oluwagbenga initially pleaded not guilty. However, “he later changed his plea to guilty when he was confronted with evidence,” Oyeyemi disclosed. According to him, the court, therefore, sentenced him to three years in prison with hard labour without an option of fine. “The convict was arrested during a court session at Itori Chief Magistrate court when his conduct was not in any way in tandem with the practice of somebody who has been called to the bar, as noticed by the magistrate himself. “He was subsequently detained at Ewekoro Police Station from where he was transferred to state criminal investigation and intelligence department for diligent prosecution,” the PPRO said.

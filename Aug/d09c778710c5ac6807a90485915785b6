Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemates, Nengi and Lucy on Sunday, engaged in war of words. The drama started after Nengi heard Lucy talking about her in the room. Nengi approached Lucy angrily and decided to vent her spleen in front of her. Lucy, while responding, said Nengi only knows how to flaunt herself before male housemates and be with different men every week. Lucy said: “You only know how to flaunt yourself around men. “You just have skin colour and nothing. You like to be touched by men. “All the people claiming to be your friends wouldn’t tell you the truth but I will.” Replying, Nengi said: “Old woman, amoeba. I don’t have time for your rubbish. “I will answer you if you want to behave like a child.” Video: #Lucy and #Nengi conclude the week with fight #bbnaija2020 #bbnaija2020lockdown pic.twitter.com/uisgoknOuo — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 9, 2020

Big Brother Naija, Lockdown housemate, Prince has said if given the chance to break a relationship in the house, he will pick the relationship between Kiddwaya and Erica. Housemates were instructed and paired to act as Big Brother for Thursday’s diary session. Erica, who was Prince’s Biggie, asked him which relationship in the house he would like to break up. Prince said he would break Kiddwaya and Erica’s relationship because he feels it is mere infatuation, especially from Kiddwaya’s side. “Kiddwaya and Erica’s relationship is just mere infatuation at the moment. “I admire Erica and I think Kiddwaya is just playing along,” Prince said.

Vee accused Laycon of loitering around Erica despite being warned to stay away. “You can’t be friends with the person (Erica) who is hurting your heart. “I saw you talking to her and she was rubbing cream on your face. “You don’t listen, that’s why I’m angry with you. You need to move on,” Vee told Laycon. Meanwhile, housemates except Kiddwaya and Tolanibaj are up for possible eviction on Sunday.

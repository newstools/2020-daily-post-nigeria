The National Consultative Front, the newly-formed political group, on Monday, lamented that Nigerians are victims of misrule. NCF leaders, Prof. Pat Utomi and Ghali Na’Abba, made the remark in a statement they jointly signed. They noted that Nigerians can turn the tide around through unwavering unity and solidarity. The group also faulted Nigeria’s constitution, stressing that it does not favour Nigerians. NCF said Nigeria needs a constitution that would benefit it’s citizenry. It explained that a new constitution that would give room for consultation, on issues like referendum, self determination and representation in government is needed in Nigeria. The statement reads partly: “To consult with all sections of the country with a view to giving Nigerians a constitution that may work for our country to the benefit of all Nigerians. The consultations will include fundamental issues like referendum, self determination, principles of proportional representation of the people in government etc. The current constitution cannot be said to be working in favor of Nigerians. “To mobilize for the economic well-being and prosperity of all Nigerians by ensuring that Chapter 2 of the present Constitution i.e., Fundamental Objectives and Directive Principles of State Policy becomes justiciable once and for all. “We as victims and casualties of the misrule and rot in the country, must all note at all times that our victory, in this new national rescue and salvation journey, can only come through our unwavering solidarity and unity.” Recall that NCF had recently urged Nigerians to be prepared for nationwide mass action against the President Muhammadu Buhari government.

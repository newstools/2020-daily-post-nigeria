Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Nengi has made clarification on having a shower together with fellow housemate, Ozo. Neo on Tuesday morning told Eric that he saw Nengi in the shower with Ozo. However, Nengi speaking to Prince told him that she was in the shower with Ozo because she wanted to talk to him privately. According to her, Ozo was not naked while she had the conversation. Nengi said: “Ozo was not fully dressed but not naked though. “I wanted to have a conversation with him about something and it definitely had to be in the shower.” I only went there to speak with him and he wasn’t naked – Nengi speaks on meeting with Ozo in the shower #BBNaijaLockdown #BBNaijalockdown2020 #bbnaija2020 pic.twitter.com/mi3IY88eDo — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 4, 2020

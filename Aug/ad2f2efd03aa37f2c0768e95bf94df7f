Aisha Buhari, Nigeria’s First Lady, has provided update on the health challenges that led to her travel to the United Arab Emirates for medical treatment. DAILY POST reported that Aisha was flown abroad for medical treatment. She left Nigeria for Dubai, UAE, due to persistent neck pain. In a statement she personally signed and made available to DAILY POST on Saturday night, Aisha said, “I want to use this opportunity to thank all Nigerians for their prayers and well wishes while I was away for medical treatment in the United Arabs Emirates (UAE). I am well now and fully recovered and have since returned back home, Nigeria. “I recall hosting the private healthcare providers earlier in the year and we had a very productive engagement where the issue of building the capacity of Nigeria health sector was the major focus, and funding was discovered to be the major challenge. “I therefore call on the healthcare providers to take the advantage of the Federal Government’s initiative through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) guidelines for the operation of NGN100 Billion Credit Support for the Healthcare Sector as was released recently contained in a circular dated March 25, 2020 to the Commercial Banks.” Aisha noted that such will help in building and expanding Nigeria’s health sector capacity and “ultimately reduce medical trips and tourism outside the Country.” The First Lady further appreciated the frontline workers and Nigerians for remaining steadfast as the country navigate the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mrs Buhari had earlier confirmed the flight incident that nearly claimed her life and that of her daughter, Hanan on Friday. DAILY POST reported earlier that she encountered some troubles in the air while returning to Nigeria from her medical check up in Dubai. Confirming the incident in a series of tweets on Saturday night, Aisha commended the crew of the Airforce flight for the courage in managing the dangerous movement.

Aliyu Lemu, lawyer to the suspended acting Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, Ibrahim Magu, has said that up till this moment, his client has not been told why he is being investigated. Lemu said this when he appeared on Channels Television’s Politics Today, adding that the former EFCC boss is not happy with the way the hearing is being conducted. According to him, the committee is already going against President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive to conduct a public hearing. “He (Magu) has not been informed why he is being investigated,” the lawyer said. “Magu has a lot of problems with the way the committee has conducted hearings. “Against the directive of the President, the committee has been meeting without media presence. “The committee has been meeting privately at the Villa, against a public hearing President Buhari ordered,” he said. Recall that Magu had recently claimed that some powerful toes he stepped on while doing his job as the EFCC Chairman were out to tarnish his image and destroy his reputation. Magu told the Presidential Committee On Audit Of Recovered Assets, PCARA, that suspects and other criminal elements he prosecuted were after him. Magu is being investigated over alleged mismanagement and lack of transparency in managing recovered assets by the EFCC from 2015 to 2020.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Neo, on Friday disclosed that Erica likes Laycon more than Kiddwaya. The BBNaija housemate said this in response to Laycon’s lamentations on Erica’s attitude towards him. Laycon said he was tired of Erica intentionally touching Kiddwaya in front of him. In a conversation with Neo and Vee, Laycon said Erica’s action was making him emotionally unsettled. Reacting, Neo said Erica loves Laycon more than Kiddwaya but can’t figure out why she opts to stay with the Head of House. Speaking with Laycon, Neo said: “Erica likes you more than Kid, but what I don’t understand is why she stays with Kid. “She came to you. As long as you keep going around her you are satisfying an urge she wants but the question is what are you getting out of it.” Laycon, Erica, and Kiddwaya are currently caught up in a love triangle.

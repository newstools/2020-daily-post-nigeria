A barber, Toheeb Shafiu, on Wednesday dragged his wife of three years, Fatimo, before an Ile-Tuntun Customary Court in Ibadan, seeking a divorce for threatening to attack him with a machete. Shafiu, who resides in Beyerunka area in Ibadan, said:” I am better off living alone than dead. “Fatimo has been after my life since I impregnated another girl that I dated before I married her. ”She has made attempts on my life with a machete. She attacked me on a number of occasions with broken bottles. ”I am not safe anymore living under the same roof with her. She destroyed my belongings and curses me at will,” Shafiu alleged. NAN reports that Fatimo, who opposed the prayer for divorce, refused to comment on the allegations levelled against her. She instead submitted that her husband was an unrepentant cheat. “Shafiu lied to me that he was not seeing the woman he got pregnant. I later discovered that he kept her in his parent’s home. “As a result, he comes home only when he feels like. When I challenged him, he held me in a chokehold and beat me,” she alleged. Delivering a ruling, Chief Henry Agbaje, the court’s President advised the couple to maintain peace. Agbaje called for more evidence to support their claims. He requested both parties to produce their relatives and adjourned the matter until Aug. 31 for judgment.

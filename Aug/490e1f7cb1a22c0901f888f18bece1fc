The Nigerian Senate, Tuesday, urged the Federal Government of Nigeria to ensure remittance of 1 per cent into the account of National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure in line with laws that set up the agency. The fortune fell on NASENI when its Executive Vice-Chairman, Professor Mohammed Sani Haruna, made submissions on revenue projections of the agency for the 2021 budget before the Senate’s Joint Committee on Finance and National Planning. Professor Haruna in his submissions lamented that the agency had never received 1% remittance from the federation account as provided by the 2004 National Assembly Acts. The Act according to him, stipulates that NASENI shall draw from the federation account, 1 per cent revenue accruing to the Federal Treasury beginning from year 2000 but the agency had never received a kobo from the federation account as stipulated by the law. Moved by the submission, the joint committee led by Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola ( ordered the Accountant General of the Federation (AGF) Ahmed Idris, to begin from September this year, the disbursement of 1 per cent allocation from the federation account into the coffers of NASENI. “The Act setting up NASENI was the Act of the National Assembly and the Accountant General of the Federation could not be allowed to flout the law. “Therefore, since the AGF is here, please ensure that the executive starts implementation of the law from September this year because NASENI has potentials to develop and industrialise the Nigerian economy through the core mandates given to it by the extant laws.”

Some pensioners in Rivers State have appealed to the state government to pay four years pension gratuities and arrears owed them. In a statement made available to journalists on Monday in Port Harcourt by their spokesman, Mr Lucky Ati, the pensioners lamented that some of them had not received anything since five years ago (2015). “We have written several letters to Governor Nyesom Wike to no avail,” the pensioners fumed. The pensioners blamed the immediate past administration of the state for their plight. “The administration preceding Wike enacted the contributory pension without preparations and plans for smooth take-off; this has caused us untold hardship and even deaths,” the pensioners said. The pensioners, however, thanked Governor Wike for repealing the pension law but pleaded with him to come to their aid by paying the arrears, NAN reports.

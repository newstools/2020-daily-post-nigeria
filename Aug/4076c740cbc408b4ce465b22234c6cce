Chelsea boss, Frank Lampard, has decided that the club’s new signing, Thiago Silva would not replace defender, Cesar Azpilicueta, as the Blues captain ahead of the 2020/21 season. According to the Telegraph UK, Lampard has no plans to strip Azpilicueta, who won the Chelsea armband since 2018 following the signing of Silva. Recall that it was speculated a few days ago whether Silva would be given the armband at the West London club due to his reputation and Chelsea’s young side. Silva, 35, officially joined Chelsea on Friday morning shortly after leaving PSG, having run his contract down with the French Ligue 1 champions. The Brazil centre-back brings a wealth of experience, having captained club and country for a number of years. He only narrowly missed out on winning the 2019/20 Champions League earlier this month after PSG lost 1-0 to Bayern Munich in the final in Portugal. Meanwhile, a former Barcelona star, Rivaldo, has urged Lampard to make Silva his new captain at Chelsea because of his wealth of experience in football.

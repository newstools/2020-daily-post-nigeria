Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has said that he usually feels very bad and uncomfortable going a day without fighting with people. The Governor also said that it is his duty to raise the Blood Pressure, (BP) of those who do not want to see him. According to Wike, he enjoys it when his name is being mentioned in Abuja for whatever reasons. Governor Wike said this when he addressed stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital on Thursday. “I’m not one person anybody can threaten. Of course, all of you know that when you threaten me you even worsen the situation because I’ll not agree and I’m not afraid of fighting,” Wike said. “Without a fight, it’s like something is wrong with me so I need it every day. Anytime I stay [a day] and no problem, nobody is calling my name, I feel something is wrong. “So when they go to Abuja and they call my name I feel so happy. It shows that worrying them and it’s my duty to make sure that those who don’t want to see me are worrying every day and their BP will go very high. That’s the job I do now to make people’s BP go very very high.” Governor Wike added, “Let me use this [opportunity] to warn everybody, let nobody distract you; let nobody deceive you. Nobody should attend any meeting anybody calls because they want to run for governorship. “We have never come to that point. I have just stayed one year in office. I’ve not even stayed up to two years. We’re walking for our party to be united to make sure that the APC does not have a little space in our state. “Those of them who think they’re too fast because they promised them a ticket in the party, don’t worry sooner or later you’ll see them run back because where they’re going, there’s no road.”

President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of Portugal has rescued two women from drowning at an Algarve beach after their kayak capsized, according to BBC. The 71-year President was pictured swimming over to the kayakers who were struggling in the water. De Sousa later told the press that the women had been swept by currents from a neighbouring beach into the bay.

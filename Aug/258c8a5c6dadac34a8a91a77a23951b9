Biggie on Thursday advised Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, BBNaija, Laycon, on how to deal with his feelings for his love interest, Erica. DAILY POST recalls that Laycon had developed feelings and declared his intention to Erica. Laycon was turned down on Tuesday as Erica made it clear that she is physically attracted to male housemate, Kiddwaya, and just mentally attracted to him. Erica then left Laycon and returned to Kiddwaya earlier on Thursday. However, in today’s dairy section, Biggie told Laycon to have respect for his fellow housemate’s decision. Laycon’s Diary Session: “Hello Big Brother. Thank you, Big Brother. Well, I’m feeling a lot of emotions. I feel sad and optimistic. Well, I’m attracted to a Housemate, but she is only attracted to me mentally not physically, so I’m sad about that. “Can I get advice from the housemate I’m attracted to in the house?”, Laycon asked Biggie. Biggie said: “Laycon, matters of the heart could be fickle and at the end of the day you need to respect your housemate’s decision or perhaps follow the friendship and if not then you need to be honest.”

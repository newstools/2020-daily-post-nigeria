Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has provided an update on his squad ahead of Saturday’s FA Community Shield clash with Arsenal at Wembley Stadium. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Friday, Klopp said defender, Virgil van Dijk is fine after he sustained a head injury during Liverpool’s 2-2 friendly draw with Salzburg a few days ago. The Reds boss also provided the latest update on Jordan Henderson, Xherdan Shaqiri, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joel Matip and Harry Wilson. “Virgil looks fine, he looks not good because he has the cut there, but apart from that it should be fine,” Klopp said. “All the boys who were not involved so far or got slight knocks in pre-season will not be available for tomorrow, but [are] getting closer, really closer, closer and closer so hopefully, the majority of them can start training completely normal after the Arsenal game, but this game is now a bit too early for them. Maybe one or two [will be] involved in the squad, we have to see. “That’s it pretty much. Hendo and Joel [Matip] looked really good, in a good way. Ox, early stages, but good. Shaq, good. Trent, very close, we have to decide about tomorrow. Harry [Wilson] looks good.” The kick-off time for the match is 4:30 pm.

The immediate past Governor of Ogun State and Senator representing Ogun Central, Senator Ibikunle Amosun, has expressed sadness over the death of Senator Buruji Kashamu, saying he fought myriads of wars for his personal freedom. Amosun, in a statement by his media aide, Bola Adeyemi, said death has once again “robbed us of the contribution of an enigmatic politician of the PDP, who represented Ogun East Senatorial District at the 8th Senate.” Amosun said, “Although we belonged to different political persuasions, and disagreed on most issues, Senator Kashamu will nonetheless be remembered for his assertive presence in the political arena and uncommon doggedness.” The former Governor recalled that Kashamu “fought myriad of wars with every breath in his soul in the defence of whatever he believed in and for his personal freedom,” adding that “hate him or love him, he could not be easily ignored” Amosun prayed that God will forgive Kashamu’s earthly sins and give him eternal rest. He expressed condolences to the nuclear and political family members of the late founder and financier of the Omo Ilu Foundation, the Ijebu Igbo Community, and Ogun State as a whole.

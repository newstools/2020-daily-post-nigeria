Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has hit out at his players, over their “mental decline” after they won the Serie A title. The Italian champions finished their league campaign with a 3-1 defeat to Roma on Saturday night. It saw a 39-match unbeaten home run dating back to April 2018 coming to an end. Juve were crowned champions for the ninth straight season, despite winning just two of their final eight league matches and Sarri claims his team dropped off after beating Lazio on July 20. “A little fear can do us good. After Lazio we felt the championship was won and we had a mental decline,” Sarri told Sky Sport Italia. “Now we have to be good at having an opponent’s consideration. We will start from 1-0 [down] and it will be very difficult in these conditions.”

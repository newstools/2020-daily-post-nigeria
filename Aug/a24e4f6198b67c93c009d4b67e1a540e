Former Barcelona star, Rivaldo has predicted that Paris Saint-Germain defender, Thiago Silva, will do a great job at Chelsea if he eventually joins the Premier League giants this summer. Silva had drawn the interest of Chelsea in the past few days, with the Blues boss, Frank Lampard, keen to make him his new captain, should he complete his free transfer in the coming days. The Brazilian international admitted he had played his last game for PSG last Sunday, following a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League final. PSG manager, Thomas Tuchel, is desperate for Silva to remain with the Ligue 1 champions, but the 35-year-old’s mind is made up. Speaking on the development, Rivaldo backed his fellow compatriot for the Chelsea captaincy, adding that Silva will certainly bring a wealth of experience with him to Stamford bridge. “I’m confident that he [Thiago Silva] will do a great job there [at Chelsea],” Rivaldo said as quoted by Daily Star. “He is a great centre back with excellent positioning and vast experience of world football. “I think he still comes with plenty to offer. I would back him to produce good football in the Premier League. “And he should be a commanding voice in Frank Lampard’s otherwise young squad. “Nowadays, many players extend their careers until their late-thirties and Silva is a good example of that, as I was in my time. “If you keep yourself in good physical condition you can easily play at the highest level until 36-37-years-old.”

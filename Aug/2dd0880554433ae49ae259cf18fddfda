Former Real Madrid and Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Chelsea to beat Arsenal 2-1 in today’s FA Cup final fixture at Wembley Stadium. Owen believes Chelsea have the edge over Arsenal because Frank Lampard’s side have a better squad than the Gunners this season. Chelsea defeated Manchester Unite 3-1 in the FA Cup semi-final encounter last month, while Arsenal won Manchester City 2-0 to reach the final. Providing his prediction, Owen wrote in his column for BetVictor: “Looking at the game this time around, I believe Chelsea have the better squad and with the Premier League table and recent history both favouring Chelsea as well. “I am going for a 2-1 win to the Blues which will hand Frank Lampard his first piece of silverware as a manager.” The match kick-off time between Arsenal and Chelsea is 5:30 pm.

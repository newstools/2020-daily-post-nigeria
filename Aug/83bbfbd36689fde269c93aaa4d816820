Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State, Friday, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to increase funding and logistics to the Nigeria Army, rather than contemplating sacking the Service Chiefs. The Governor, who stated this during the ground-breaking ceremony of Nigeria Army Reference Hospital, Abakaliki, praised the Army for their gallantry and dedication towards securing the Territory of the Nation. He noted that the assignment of the Army was not an easy task and as such, needed the full cooperation of Citizens at all levels to succeed. According to him: “I have to disagree with members of the National Assembly over their recent call for the sack of the nation’s Service Chiefs. One thing I have realized in this country is that we like change too much. We want everybody to test every seat. That is not what we need at this crucial time, the country is facing security challenges. “The Chief of Army Staff is a very big committed person, and very friendly with the civil society. “So, what these people need is cooperation, information. It is difficult for people to do everything without information. This is very important and at this stage of the change. “Whoever that is coming is going to be amendable. But I believe strongly that the decision taken by the Service Chiefs are not taken by themselves alone. “So, I will be suggesting to Mr. President not to consider removing the Service Chiefs. “But, we should increase their logistics, we should increase the funding of their armed forces. We should increase the programs that will bring information to the security agencies. “Let me thank the President for finding Ebonyi fit to site this project. Ebonyi is very lucky with the Army. We will continue to partner you we expect him, the Chief of Army Staff to Commission the internal roads we did for the Army. “The new GOC is more like a brother. We want to thank you and appreciate you for being an Ebonyi man. Thanks for choosing this State for the citing of this project.”

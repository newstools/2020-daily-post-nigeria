Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has admitted he was ‘disappointed’ with his team’s exit from this year’s Champions League. Sarri said Juventus gave everything and played great against Lyon but could not qualify for the quarter-final. Sarri’s men defeated Lyon 2-1 in the Champions League round of 16 second leg tie at the Allianz, thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo’s brace. The Serie A champions had lost 1-0 against the Ligue 1 club in the first leg back in February. But Lyon advanced into the last eight on an away goal rule after a 2-2 draw aggregate. “We played a great match,” Sarri told Sky Italia. “We gave it our all and tried everything. “We believed it all the way to the end. We regret the first half of the first leg. “We are disappointed, but there is nothing to say about tonight’s performance.”

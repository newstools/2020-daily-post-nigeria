Chelsea winger, Willian, is edging closer to the exit door, after rejecting the club’s latest offer to sign a new two-year contract. The Brazil midfielder has now held talks with London rivals, Arsenal, according to the UK Guardian. The Gunners are believed to be ready to meet his demands for a three-year deal. Arsenal were reportedly ready to offer Willian a £250,000-a-week contract before the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Willian is also keen on a move to the Emirates, as he is settled in the capital with his family. The 31-year-old is increasingly likely to leave after the second leg of the last-16 Champions League tie against Bayern Munich on Saturday. Although Willian is expected to delay a decision on his future until after that game, Arsenal are optimistic of signing the player. Chelsea have already strengthened their forward line with the signings of Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech and remain in talks with Bayer Leverkusen over Kai Havertz.

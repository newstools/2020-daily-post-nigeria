The Osun State Police Command has said that the delay in the arraignment of Inspector Ago Egharevba, who allegedly brutalised a fashion designer, Ayomide Taiwo was to ensure that justice prevails. The victim, Ayomide Taiwo reportedly died on Sunday. The command had said that inspector Ago could be arraigned on Monday by 9:00am but the case had not been brought to court as at the time of filing this report. DAILY POST reports that a 20-year-old fashion designer, Ayomide was allegedly brutalised by Inspector Ago with the butt of the gun over N50 bribe. Ayomide died at 08:30 am on Sunday after six days in coma at the Ladoke Akintola Teaching Hospital (LAUTECH), Osogbo, where he was receiving treatment. It was gathered that on Tuesday, Ayomide was attacked alongside his brother, Wasiu Taiwo at Ibokun and sustained an open injury on his hand. Inspector Ago attached to Ibokun Divisional Police Headquarters has been recommended for dismissal by the Commissioner for Police in Osun, Undie Adie. The Police Public Relations Officer, Yemisi Opalola, told DAILY POST during a phone call interview on Monday that there is a delay in the case because of some management process. She further clarified that the police are still gathering evidence and speaking with the eyewitnesses to ensure that justice prevails. “We are looking for more evidence before the accused could be charged to court. The police will charge Inspector Ago to court immediately after we finished our investigation.” The PPRO said. Yemisi assured the public to promote peace saying that the Osun police command will ensure that justice prevails.

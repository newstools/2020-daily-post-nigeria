Armed bandits reportedly invaded Kurfi town in Kurfi Local Government Area of Katsina State, northwest Nigeria on Sunday night. Residents said the bandits attacked the town when the residents were preparing for Isha’i prayers around 8:00pm. According to them, the bandits began shooting sporadically and forced themselves into some households and shops, where they killed and carted away people’s belongings. DAILY POST reports that the extent of damages done by the bandits in terms of number of lives lost and properties is still sketchy as of the time of writing this report, however, residents are said to have fled their homes and are taking refuge in surrounding bushes. Katsina State, which borders Niger Republic, has suffered a series of attacks from bandits and other terrorist groups operating in the area. Earlier on Sunday, there was a report of attack on some foreign nationals working with ACTED, a French humanitarian organisation across the border where six French aid workers, a guide and driver were killed by a suspected terrorist group across the border in Niger. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, which occurred at about 11:00 am on Sunday, but locals in Katsina State say bandits or ISIS groups may be behind the attack.

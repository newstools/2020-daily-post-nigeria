The Centre for Anti-Corruption and Open Leadership (CACOL) has commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his decision on the University of Lagos (UNILAG). On Friday, Buhari ordered the Governing Council Chairman, Wale Babalakin and the Vice Chancellor, Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, to vacate their positions. CACOL Director of Administration, Tola Oresanwo, in a statement on Sunday, said this would calm frayed nerves at the institution. CACOL stressed that the presidential directive was needed to stop the crisis from getting out of control. “We have always believed in the principle of University Autonomy which is the institutional form of academic freedom and a necessary precondition to guarantee the proper fulfillment of the functions entrusted to higher-education teaching personnel and institutions. “We hope this intervention will not in any way violate the autonomy being enjoyed by the university and also believe this will bring a lasting solution to the crisis and engender peace and mutual co-existence between all the stakeholders of the university”, it said. Stakeholders, including UNILAG Senate, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU), Non-Academic Staff Union (NASU), have individually and collectively condemned Babalakin. In its reaction, Committee of Vice Chancellors of Universities called Ogundipe’s sack “a hatchet job”.

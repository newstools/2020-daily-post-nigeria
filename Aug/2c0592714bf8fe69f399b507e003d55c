Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has confirmed that defender, Eric Garcia, rejected a new contract extension to remain at Etihad. According to Guardiola, Garcia wants to leave City to play in another club once his current contract at the club expires. The City boss stated this at his pre-match press conference ahead of Man City’s Champions League tie with Real Madrid on Friday night. Garcia, 19, made nineteen appearances in all competitions for City this season. “Garcia announced to us that he doesn’t want to extend his contract with Manchester City,” Guardiola said. “He has one more year, and after that, he does not want to extend. “We want it, but he does not want to extend it, so I imagine he wants to play in other places.”

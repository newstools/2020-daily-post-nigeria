The Defence Headquarters has confirmed that the troops of Operation DELTA SAFE, on Tuesday, in Bayelsa State, invaded the Pirates/Militants’ camp killing six criminals. The Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche, made this known in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja. Enenche said the troops acted on credible intelligence and monitored movements of a suspected pirate/sea gang leader, who sneaked into town from Port Harcourt. The troops later raided the pirates’ camp at Tukugbene-Ayama Ijaw Local Government Area where they arrested both suspects and their gang members. According to Enenche, upon arrival at the personal jetty of the suspect, troops engaged in gunfire from pirates/militants in five boats that approached from adjoining creek. The statement read in part: “The troops were met with heavy resistance, but their overwhelming firepower led to the forceful withdrawal of the pirates/militants, with various degrees of gunshot wounds. Enenche added that five of the pirates/militants were neutralised ashore while the troops sustained the firefight. “Furthermore, three of the attacking boats were sunk while the occupants with various degrees of gunshot wounds escaped into the river. “In the process, troops recovered three boats from the pirates. “Additionally, our troops took over the jetty and advanced to the objective area which was empty.” Enenche disclosed that three AK47 rifles with a magazine, two 200 HP Yamaha outbound engines and three 115HP Yamaha outbound engines were also recovered during the operation. The Military High Command commended the troops for their dexterity and advised them to remain resolute in curtailing the activities of pirates/militants in the Niger Delta region.

Bayern Munich defender, Alphonso Davies, has claimed Lionel Messi did not give him his shirt after they beat Barcelona on August 14. Davies was speaking after their 3-0 win over Lyon, which saw them qualify for the Champions League final this Sunday. “Yeah I asked for it, but I think he was a little upset,” Davies told BT Sport. “It’s OK, though, next time hopefully.” The 19-year-old also impressed, as the Bundesliga champions qualified for their sixth final in the competition. After the match, he said: “It feels good. Everyone is happy and playing well. We are happy to make it to the final. PSG is a good team, right now we celebrate a bit then we focus on the next game.” Both Bayern Munich and Paris Saint-Germain will be aiming to finish this campaign with a Treble, after the two sides won their respective league titles and cup competitions.

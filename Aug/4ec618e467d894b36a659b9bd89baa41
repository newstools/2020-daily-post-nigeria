Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, will be suspended and also fine £1.1million if he loses his ‘free agent’ legal battle with the club, Marca reports. According to Marca, Messi, who will reportedly be offered a record £450million over five years by Manchester City is set to suffer “serious penalties” as a result of his actions. The 33-year-old believes he is no longer an employee of the Catalan club, but Barcelona board insist he is still the Blaugrana captain. Recall that Messi is attempting to trigger a clause in the contract he signed in 2017, that allows him to leave Camp Nou for free at the end of each season. Barcelona has argued that the deadline for activating the clause expired in June. Messi’s legal team continue to argue that he’s already unilaterally rescinded his contract with the club. The Argentine captain refused to show up for Barcelona training on Sunday, but LaLiga insisted Messi’s €700 million buyout clause remains active.

Chief Bode George, a former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has blasted Ayodele Fayose, a former Governor of Ekiti State, accusing him of saying that Governor Godwin Obaseki will lose the forthcoming governorship election in Edo State. Appearing on Plustv Africa, Fayose was quoted as saying that despite being a member of the PDP, it would be difficult for him to support Obaseki’s re-election bid. Bode George picked holes in the former Governor’s comments saying that he [Fayose] was on his own. In a statement yesterday, George wondered why a committed member of a political party could make such comment when he had immensely benefited from same party. “I am countering such remarks by telling the people of Edo State that we, members of the PDP, in the South-West are in support of Obaseki,” George said. “We pray for him and we will work and support for him to win the election. “I and the PDP in the South-West dissociate ourselves from Fayose’s statement. He is on his own because we do not know where that is coming from,” he said. Meanwhile, Fayose has asked George to retire from politics and go get a rest. According to Fayose, George was deliberately reading different meanings to what he said on the Edo State governorship election for cheap political gains.

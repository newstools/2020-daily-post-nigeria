Some aggrieved indigenes of Southern Kaduna on Saturday agreed on a peace deal, in a bid to put an end to the protracted crisis in the area. The peace deal was reached during a meeting between the Atyap, Fulani and Hausa communities in the area. The meeting was convened by His Highness, the Agwatyap, Dominic Gambo Yahaya at the Mariyamu and Yakubu Event Centre in Ungwan Wakili. Participants at the meeting condemned the killings and the destruction witnessed in the communities. In a 14-point resolution, all warring members of the communities cautioned residents of Atyap Chiefdom not to take laws into their hands. It was agreed that aggrieved members of the community should always report their grievances to lawful authorities. The communique reads, “The meeting appreciated the fact that all Nigerians have the constitutional or fundamental rights to move and reside anywhere in Nigeria, including Atyap Chiefdom, without any fear, molestation or harassment from anybody or any source whatsoever. “The summit, therefore, calls on the authorities to facilitate the return of displaced persons. “It recommended the establishment of a standing peace committee that should comprise of Hausa, Fulani and Atyap and their youth to organise robust engagement/dialogue on security issues from time to time with a view to sustaining peaceful coexistence.” Present at the meeting were the President of Southern Kaduna People’s Union, Jonathan Asake, and spokesperson of the group, Luka Binniyat.

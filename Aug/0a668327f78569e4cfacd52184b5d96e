A Nigerian basketball player, Michael Ojo, has collapsed and died during a training session in Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Ojo’s death was confirmed by his former team, Red Star Belgrade, on Friday. “We are deeply saddened by the news,” Red Star’s spokesperson, Igor Vujicin, said. Although, the causes of death were not disclosed, but local media claims Ojo suffered cardiac arrest. The 27-year-old played for Florida State University in the US, before leaving to Europe to begin his professional career. After a stint with the Belgrade team FMP Zeleznik, he moved to Red Star, where he spent two seasons and became a fans’ favourite. Ojo had been without a club since June 30, but was still training with Red Star.

Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, has congratulated Senator Gbenga Ashafa and AbdulMumin Jibrin on their appointments. President Muhammadu Buhari named Ashafa as the Managing Director of the Federal Housing Authority (FHA). Jibrin is the new Executive Director, Business Development (Commercial, Corporate and Social Housing). Their appointment, for an initial term of 4 years, took effect on July 16, 2020. The Speaker said the duo are round pegs in a round hole. Gbajabiamila said Ashafa (ex-representative of Lagos East) and Jibrin (ex-Kano representative for Kiru/Bebeji federal constituency) come with a lot of experience as former legislators and public servants. Jibrin served as Director-General of Gbajabiamila/Wase Speakership campaign in 2019. Gbajabiamila expressed confidence that they would serve diligently and patriotically. He thanked Buhari for recognising the “both Ambassadors of the National Assembly.” In his reaction, Kano Governor, Umar Ganduje, described the appointment as a plus towards the development of the federal government housing policy. “I am commending the President for this. Hon. Abdulmumini Kofa will be diligent, hard-working and committed to the government’s housing policy, which is geared towards global best practice”, he said.

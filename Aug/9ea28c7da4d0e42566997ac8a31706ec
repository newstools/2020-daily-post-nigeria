Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has criticised Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola for ‘tinkering’ with his formation and players following the Citizens’ Champions League last-8 final 3-1 defeat against Lyon on Saturday night. Lyon eliminated Man City from the Champions League, thanks to a goal from Maxwel Cornet and a brace from Moussa Dembele. Kevin De Bruyne did score a goal for Guardiola’s side at the Estádio José Alvalade in Portugal. But Ferdinand believes Guardiola must accept the majority of the blame for Man City’s shock defeat against the French Ligue 1 side for keeping most of his creative players, Riyad Mahrez, David Silva and Bernardo Silva on the bench. “I’m stunned really, we spoke about the game beforehand, City being overwhelming favourites given the standard of players they have in their squad, but they never performed today,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “We spoke about it at half-time, Pep Guardiola tinkering with his formation, tinkering with the players. “I think, his most creative players were off the pitch, and we saw when Mahrez came on, they looked a much better team, one creative player out of probably the three or four that you would normally see in and around the starting XI. “But listen, Raheem Sterling and Ederson are going to get the headlines for the mistakes that they made and Jesus as well when they were on top at 1-1. “Not much went for them today, but they have to look at themselves. Even Cancelo playing left-back, how many times did the ball go out there can he cut back on his right foot? Getting behind teams is what Pep’s about. “But you need creative players to draw people out, create space for runners to then get in, and they did not do it enough in this game definitely.”

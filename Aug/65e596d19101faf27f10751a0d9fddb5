Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has said that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government will effectively deal with the Southern Kaduna crisis. According to him, the Buhari administration will not sweep the major issues underlying the conflict under the carpet. He said the government will ensure “justice, fixing economic marginalization and the prosecution of persons responsible for these murders -this is to ensure that the impunity doesn’t worsen.” The Vice President stated this at the ongoing Nigeria Bar Association, NBA, Annual General Conference during a Special Conversation. Osinbajo said “There have been judicial commissions and all sorts, but the problem remains. So, there is the need to address the underlying issues. You can’t sweep under the carpet, justice and the cries of economic marginalization. “The fact is that we must prosecute persons responsible for these murders or otherwise impunity will worsen. And also support those who have lost their bread winners. “The mindless callous killings in Southern Kaduna are heartbreaking. And again we must condole those who have lost loved ones and those injured or who have suffered loss of property. These tragedies are unacceptable and they are avoidable.” On a personal note, the Vice President added “I have also engaged with community leaders in Southern Kaduna and also I have engaged with the governor to look at what peacemaking efforts are possible.”

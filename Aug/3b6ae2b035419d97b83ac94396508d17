President Muhammadu Buhari has approved the establishment of a National Centre for the Control of Small Arms and Light Weapons. National Security Adviser (NSA), retired Maj-Gen. Babagana Monguno, made the announcement on Thursday. He spoke with State House correspondents after a virtual meeting of the Council of State chaired by the President. “Based on my recommendation to the President, he has approved the establishment of a National Centre for the control of small arms and light weapons in Nigeria, to be domiciled in the office of the National Security Adviser. “The centre will be akin to the Counter-Terrorists Centre and also the Cyber-security Centre, which are both domiciled in the office of the National Security Adviser.” It will provide the strategic framework for containing the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, especially those coming from across our borders especially within the West Africa sub-region and through the maritime environment. The establishment will also work in compliance with already laid down international standards and ECOWAS moratorium on the control of small arms and light weapons. The NSA disclosed that Buhari directed that there should be improved synergy and collaboration between the Armed Forces and other security agencies operating in the country. “What this means is that there should be improvement in the synergy and collaboration between the Armed Forces on one hand and the intelligence agencies on the other hand while we simultaneously work with the para-military organisations.” The NSA added that the President approved the procurement of more arms and ammunition to boost the fight against insurgency and other security challenges.

The Imo State Government has condemned Monday’s attack on the convoy of Governor Hope Uzodinma. The incident occurred as Imo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (ISOPADEC) staff protested their three months salary arrears. On Tuesday, the Police announced the arrest of 15 persons. Commissioner of Police, Isaac Akinmoyede, said those in custody attacked the convoy with “a locally made pistol and machetes. Windscreens of some of the vehicles were smashed.” Reacting, Commissioner of Information, Declan Emelumba, said the use of weapons confirmed that most of the protests in Imo were politically-motivated. “The opposition is smarting from the irredeemable shame the government’s successes is rubbing on their face. They thought of another protest to take the shine out of Governor Uzodimma’s success stories. But, luck ran out of luck this time.” Emelumba charged the Police to carry out a thorough probe and get the motive behind the violent demonstration. The government also called for the prosecution of the culprits and their sponsors.

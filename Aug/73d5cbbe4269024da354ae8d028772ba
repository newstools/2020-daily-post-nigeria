The West Africa Examination Council (WAEC) has claimed that some of its supervisors leaked exam questions before the West Africa Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) began. This was revealed by WAEC’s Head of National Office, Patrik Areghan, on Wednesday. Areghan stated this during a monitoring exercise to some schools in Yaba, Lagos State. He confirmed that the culpable supervisors have since been arrested and warned students not to indulge in malpractice. “Students should not go about looking for anything they call expo. It is shameful, supervisors collecting question papers from WAEC and going somewhere to open the questions. “Yesterday we caught one in Nasarawa. They don’t know that we have a way of detecting them. In Bauchi, we caught another. We detected it from here. In Port Harcourt, a candidate did the same thing and was arrested,” Areghan said. This year’s examinations began on Monday, August 17 and will end September 7.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Neo has made clarifications on having feelings for Tolanibaj. Erica had told Ebuka Obi-Uchendu that Tolanibaj confessed she had feelings for Neo and was interested in a relationship with him. Tolanibaj, however, did not comment when she was asked about her intentions for Neo. But while speaking with Erica after the eviction show, Neo said Tolanibaj was just a friend to him and nothing else. According to him, he did not imagine any relationship with Tolanibaj because she was involved with Prince. Neo said: “Tolanibaj was just my friend (Gee) and I spoke to her about my ideas about what I need to do. “I didn’t reason anything like a relationship with Tolanibaj because she was involved with Prince. “Tolanibaj should have told me about her feelings though. “You don’t need trust here but trust the energy you have. “I wish Tolanibaj had told me before she left.”

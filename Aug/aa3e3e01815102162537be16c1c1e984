A cleric, Prophet Ebenezer Ajigbotoluwa, is currently cooling his heels in police net for allegedly defiling and impregnating two teenage sisters. Police identified Ajigbotoluwa as the founder and General Overseer of The Church of Lord, Olomore Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital. DAILY POST learnt that he was arrested following a report by the mother of the victims, who told the police at Lafenwa that she fell sick sometimes in 2018 and was taken to the church for spiritual healing. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, told DAILY POST that the woman accused the said pastor of seizing the opportunity to ask her entire family of six to relocate to the church premises to avoid being afflicted with the same sickness. “There and then, the prophet started having sex with her daughters of 16 and 13 years of age, unknown to her. The pastor impregnated the two underage girls and went on to procure abortion for them in a private clinic,” Oyeyemi said. Aside from this, the prophet was also said to have defrauded the family of N2million naira cash, which he reportedly collected for what he called ‘spiritual cleansing’. Upon the report, the DPO of Lafenwa division, CSP Muraina Ayilara, led his men to the church but the place has been deserted, it was gathered. The Ogun State Commissioner of Police, according to Oyeyemi, then directed that the suspect be hunted for and brought to book. “In compliance with the CP’s directive, the DPO and his men embarked on intelligence and technical-based investigation, and their efforts paid off when the prophet was arrested on the 6th of August 2020 at about 5am. “On interrogation, the suspect confessed to the commission of most of the allegations leveled against him and that it was the reason why he ran away when he heard that police are looking for him,” the PPRO informed.

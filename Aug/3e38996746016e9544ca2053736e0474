Two persons have been arrested by the police in Ogun State for alleged fraud in Ota area of the state. Police said the duo are “members of a syndicate who specialized in duping unsuspecting members of the public of their hard-earned money under the pretence of ‘washing’ dollars for them.” The two suspects were identified by the police as Chicka Kasarachi and Ifeanyi Okechuckwu. A statement by the Ogun Police spokesman, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed that the two suspects were arrested after a complaint lodged by one Omeh Chidebere Ishoke at Sango police station. Ishoke had complained that he was accosted by the suspects, who allegedly lured him to their hideout at Koleosho Street Anisere Sango-Ota. The victim was reported to have told the police that the suspects collected the sum of N148,000 from him, under the pretence that they will change the money to dollar for him and he will make a huge profit. “He stated further that the suspects also collected his MP3 mini speaker, valued at N68,000, but no dollar was given to him at the end. “Upon the report, the DPO of Sango Police Division, CSP Godwin Idehai, quickly led his men to their hideout where the two suspects were apprehended. “On interrogation, they confessed being fraudsters, who have duped many unsuspecting people using the same method,” Oyeyemi said. An unidentified liquid substance, several fake American dollars and assorted charms have been recovered from them, DAILY POST learnt. Meanwhile, the Ogun State Commissioner of Police, CP Edward A. Ajogun, it was gathered, has ordered a massive manhunt for other members of the syndicate who are on the run.

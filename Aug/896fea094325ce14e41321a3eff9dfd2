The Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Opeyemi Bamidele, has accused Governor Godwin Obaseki of unlawful acts against the Edo State House of Assembly. Bamidele reacted to the Edo imbroglio in a statement released to newsmen. He alleged that Obaseki was engaging in illegality due to the “desperation to secure a second term in office.” Bamidele said the governor’s ambition “should not be allowed to desecrate, destroy and totally subvert the legislative institution in Edo State.” He called on all lovers of democracy to speak out against Obaseki “because the legislature is an integral and critical component of democracy anywhere around the world.” Bamidele implored civil society and other stakeholders to prevail on Obaseki to allow members of the Edo State House of Assembly resume their constitutional duties without further delay. The Ekiti federal lawmaker insisted that “the continued brazen efforts aimed at debarring the Edo State lawmakers is not only a contempt against the wishes of the good people but also a gross violation of the 1999 Constitution.” He advised Obaseki to rescind his actions in the interest of peace and desist from taking actions that may cause irreparable damage to the democratic institutions. The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has condemned the Edo Assembly invasion. Their leader, Kingsley Chinda, indicted the Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami; Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu; the All Progressives Congress (APC); its ex-chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, and his supporters.

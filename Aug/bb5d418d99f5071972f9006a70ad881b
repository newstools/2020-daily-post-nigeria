Biggie on Monday fined housemates, Kiddwaya and Erica, for whispering during the live eviction show on Sunday. Kiddwaya was caught on camera whispering with his love interest, Erica before housemates proceeded for their live eviction show. Speaking during Monday’s Head of House challenge, Biggie returned the duo’s Betway wallet to zero for breaking the house rules. He said, “Erica, for allowing Kiddwaya whisper to you, and Kiddwaya, for whispering during the live eviction, your Betway wallet has been returned to zero.” The housemates are currently battling over who emerges this week’s Head of House.

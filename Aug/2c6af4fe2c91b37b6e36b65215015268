Ohanaeze Youth Council, OYC, an Igbo sociocultural organization, has reacted to the alleged killings of Igbo youths in Emene, Enugu State, on Sunday, by some security operatives. Ohanaeze described the scenario as provocative which is capable of instigating civil unrest and disobedience in the South East zone. The Igbo socio-cultural group, in a press release signed by its President, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro and made available to newsmen, Wednesday, lamented that twenty-one deaths recorded in both sides during the clash were Igbos and warned that Igbo youths would not tolerate any form of intimidation by the Nigeria security operatives. Ohanaeze Youth urged Governor’s of Igbo extraction to wade in, as there may be reprisal attacks from both sides if quick intervention is not taken. According to the release, “OYC condemn vehemently the spillage of innocent Igbo bloods in the Southeast under any guise. We will not tolerate intimidation from any quarters. “OYC urge Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, to resist any temptation to fight back. There is a trap for enemies of Ndigbo to cash in these ugly incident in Enugu State to promote chaos, civil disobedience and violence in the region. “Igbo Youths mourn all those killed in these horrific attacks. We call on Biafra agitators to call off any reprisal attacks, and call on security agents to stop further actions capable of causing mayhem in any part of Igboland, “it stated.

Arsenal on Saturday won their 14th FA Cup. The Gunners beat Chelsea 2-1 at Wembley, fighting back from a Christian Pulisic goal. Manager Mikel Arteta had his talismanic captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, to thank as he scored twice like he did in the semi-final against Manchester City. With this win, Arsenal go straight to the group stages of next season’s Europa League. They will be joined by Leicester City who finished fifth in the Premier League. However, Tottenham Hotspur who ended up in sixth place, will enter in the third qualifying round on September 24. Jose Mourinho’s men must play three one-off games to reach the group stages.

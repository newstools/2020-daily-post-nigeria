The British High Commission in Nigeria has announced that it has reopened its visa Application Centres across the country. The Commission made the announcement in a statement released via its Twitter account on Thursday, adding that there would be free visa replacement which will be open till December 2020 and covers individuals who will be travelling to the UK for work, study or to join their families. In the statement by the Commission titled, ‘Update on VAC Services From The BHC Nigeria’ the commission said that any individual whose 30-day visa to travel to the UK for work, study or visitation had expired can request for a replacement free of charge. “As a result of the disruptions to travel caused by COVID-19, we are experiencing high demand for replacement vignettes for 30-day visas to travel to the UK for work, study or to join family. “If an individual’s 30-day visa to travel to the UK for work, study or to join family has expired, or is about to expire, they can request a replacement visa with revised validity dates free of charge until the end of this year. “This does not apply to other types of visas. This process will be in place until the end of 2020. The replacement visa will be valid for 90 days.’ “To request a replacement visa, individuals can arrange to return their passport to their Visa Application Centre in Nigeria without an appointment,” the statement read.

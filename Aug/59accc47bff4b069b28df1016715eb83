The leader of INRI Evangelical spiritual church, Primate Ayodele, has reacted to the inclusion of religious centres under the Companies and Allied Matters Acts (CAMA) bill signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari few days back. Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church had earlier kicked against the government’s decision. Ayodele explained that the government was trying to meddle into spiritual affairs which, according to him, Is totally unacceptable. He described the act as a means of fighting the church by the government. In a statement to DAILY POST on Monday, Ayodele said it is highly prohibited that anyone will appoint a trustee for his church. ‘’Nobody can shut down my account, no one can get a trustee for me,” he said. “The government needs to be cautioned, they don’t have anything to do with the church,” Ayodele said, adding that he would stop patronising banks in the country very soon. Speaking further, the cleric blasted the leader of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), church leaders who have kept quiet probably because they get stipend from the government. “This is why I said they should scrap CAN, this government is testing God and I think it is high time God reacted.”

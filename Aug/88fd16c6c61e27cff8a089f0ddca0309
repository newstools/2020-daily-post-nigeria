The Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi has disclosed the readiness of the Chinese government to build a $50 million University of Transportation in Daura, Katsina State free. Amaechi disclosed that the Chinese government would also build a primary and secondary school which will cater for the educational needs of children whose families work there. He spoke in Daura, Katsina State, during his maiden inspection tour of the ongoing project. Amaechi explained that the multi-billion dollars university became necessary, so Nigeria can acquire the technology needed to operate the railway system currently being built by the China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) when the Chinese pull out. According to the Minister, the project construction would commence in September and would be completed by the end of next year. He said: ”Construction work will commence in September. What they are doing now is clearing. They have promised to build a primary school and a secondary school in the university. “This university is a donation by the Chinese government through the China Engineering Construction Corporation, CECC. The Technique, Engineering, and Marketing (TEAM) have also accepted the consultancy job. “Let me also thank the CCECC for accepting to construct the university free of charge. It is not part of the railway contract, we spoke with CCECC and told them to train Nigerians who will take over from them in their technology and they agreed.”

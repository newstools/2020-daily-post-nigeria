Borussia Dortmund players are ‘convinced’ Jadon Sancho will stay for another season, according to the UK Telegraph. Sancho is being chased by Manchester United, who missed the August 10 deadline to seal a deal with the Bundesliga side. The Red Devils are still keen on getting a deal for the 20-year-old over the line before the October deadline day. However, they would have to bid around £108million for the England winger. But Sancho’s team-mates believe he will remain in Germany for the 2020/2021 season. Dortmund coach, Lucien Favre, has been using Sancho in a front-three partnership with Erling Haaland and Thorgan Hazard during intense training drills in pre-season. Sancho scored 17 goals in 16 assists in the German top-flight last season.

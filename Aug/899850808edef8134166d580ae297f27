The Abia State chapter of the Peoples Democratic party (PDP) has described as laughable and a display of unusual state of confused mind, the number of persons that defected to the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state. Former APGA gubernatorial candidate, Dr. Alex Otti had claimed that over 400,000 and 450,000 of his followers joined him in his recent defection to APC. Reacting to the conflicting figures, the state Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Chief Fabian Nwankwo, maintained that the 400,000 and 450,000 alleged followers of Dr. Otti were mere assumptions manufactured by him to achieve undue popularity and mislead Abians and the public that he has a political weight. Nwanko said Otti failed to understand the political equation that if actually he has the backing of such a large number of followership, then, he shouldn’t have failed woefully as he did in the last two governorship elections in the state. He, however, advised Dr. Otti to live with his self inflicted woes and learn how to be a political team player. According to him, the PDP has repositioned itself to win all the elective positions in future elections. He also urged the opposition parties in the state to support the ongoing massive infrastructural revolution of the state Governor – Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, to enable Abians enjoy more dividends of democracy The party also advised people of Abia State to avoid serial liars and be careful with desperate politicians who want to ascend political power by all cost at the expense of the state resource and progress.

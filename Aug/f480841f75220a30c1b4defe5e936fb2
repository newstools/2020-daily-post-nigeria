The former lawmaker representing Ogun East Senatorial District, Senator Buruji Kashamu is dead. His former colleague, Senator Ben Bruce, confirmed this on Saturday. In a tweet, Bruce revealed Kashamu died of COVID-19 at First Cardiology Consultants in Lagos. Bruce wrote: “I have just lost my good friend of forever to #COVID19. Until his death, Sen. Buruji Kashamu and I were inseparable. He died today at First Cardiology Consultants, in Lagos.” Buruji becomes yet another high-profile casualty of the pandemic. Earlier this year, President Muhammadu Buhari lost two of his trusted aides, Abba Kyari and Isa Funtua to Coronavirus. The immediate former Ogun state Governor, Abiola Ajimobi, also died of complications arising from the virus.

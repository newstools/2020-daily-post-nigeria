German midfielder, Mesut Ozil has said he is not leaving Arsenal. The midfielder’s future at the Emirate is the subject of speculation once again this summer after he was frozen out by manager, Mikel Arteta. Ozil announced he is staying at the club and will decide when he will leave. Ozil pockets a whopping £350,000-a-week and his contract runs till 2021. Arsenal are exploring options to pay him out of his £18 million contract if he agrees to leave. But the midfielder said he cannot be forced out, adding that he is staying till the last day of his deal with the Gunners. “My position is clear. I’m here through to the last day of our agreement and I’ll give everything I have for this club,” he told The Athletic “I’ll decide when I go, not other people. I didn’t sign for two or three years, I signed for four and that should be respected by everyone. Ozil said he loves Arsenal, the people and the City of London.

The Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, on Tuesday, tasked the newly-inaugurated Executive Committee of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the state to remain neutral in handling intra-party aspirations as 2023 approaches. Ortom gave the charge at the New Banquet Hall of Benue Peoples House in Makurdi, the state capital when the new PDP EXCO paid him a visit shortly after their inauguration. The governor urged the party officials not to take sides but provide a level playing ground for all those seeking elective positions on its platform. He stressed that dialogue and the interest of PDP should be allowed to prevail at all times.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-827645" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2-2.jpeg" alt="" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2-2.jpeg 1080w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2-2-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image2-2-1024x683.jpeg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px"> The governor pledged continued support, fairness, justice and equity in the conduct of party affairs, stressing that the actions of PDP faithful should be geared towards uniting the party to make it stronger.

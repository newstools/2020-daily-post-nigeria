Lille defender, Gabriel Magalhaes, is set to complete a £22.6m move to Arsenal within the next 24 hours, the UK Metro reports. The Brazilian is set to undergo a medical with the Gunners on Thursday, after both clubs agreed a fee. Lille accepted offers from Arsenal and Napoli, but the 22-year-old has decided to move to the Emirates. Mikel Arteta identified defence as a major weakness when he arrived last December and his tactics in the second half of the campaign were designed to cover up their deficienccies at the back. However, Arteta wants to play a more expansive style of football next term and he believes that Gabriel – along with William Saliba – will allow him to play a higher line. Gabriel will arrive in London on Thursday to undergo his medical and then sign a five-year deal with the club. He will become Arsenal’s second signing of the summer, following the arrival of Willian on a free transfer from Chelsea.

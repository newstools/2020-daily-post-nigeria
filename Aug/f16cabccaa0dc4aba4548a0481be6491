The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has announced the launch of a website for monitoring elections. Henceforth, results from polling units can be watched in real-time. INEC Commissioner for Information, Festus Okoye, made this known in a statement on Thursday, He noted that the portal will “strengthen the transparency in the election result management system.” The use will start with the Nasarawa Central state constituency poll. It would also be deployed during the Edo and Ondo governorship elections. The scheduled dates are September 19 and October 20, respectively. INEC clarified that this does not mean electronic collation of results. Okoye assured that INEC was determined to ensure that votes are not only correctly counted, but that they also count. The statement said the dedicated public portal named INEC RESULT VIEWING (IReV), will enable Nigerians to view polling unit results real time as the voting ends on election day. It added that collation of election results “shall remain as provided for by law, a manual process of completion of relevant result sheets and their upwards collation until the final results are determined.”

UEFA has banned players from swapping shirts when the Champions League returns this weekend. This was included in a 31-page document, which has guidelines and safety measures. The players could also be locked up in for 12 days, according to medical protocols for the competition. Players and staff must be tested for COVID-19 prior to their departure for Portugal. The first game is scheduled for August 12 between Atalanta and Paris Saint-Germain at Benficaâ€™s Estadio da Luz. Any player that tests positive will self-isolate for 14 days and therefore miss the remainder of the tournament. And when they arrive in Lisbon, players and staff cannot leave the team hotel without prior authorisation. UEFA has also insisted that players must sleep in individual rooms and not share with teammates.

The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, National Vice Chairman, South-South, Dan Orbih, has accused Bola Tinubu, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, of plotting to impeach the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. Orbih made the allegation while linking Tinubu to the crisis in Edo State House of Assembly. Addressing a press conference on Saturday, Orbih claimed that Tinubu was dictating the terms for Obaseki’s impeachment. Orbih, however, declared that people of the state would resist Tinubu’s brand of politics He said: “I also want to state here that his style of politics in the South-West is not attractive to Edo people. “It doesn’t make any sense for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to sit down in the comfort of his home, drawing up grounds for impeachment for the elected governor of Edo State. “Reading through his statement, I have come to the conclusion that certainly, he is not aware of the issues concerning the unfortunate incident at the state House of Assembly. “I should expect, as a former governor of Lagos State, he should know better.” The crisis in the Edo State House of Assembly had led to the impeachment of the Speaker, Frank Okiye and the Deputy Speaker on same day. Reacting to the crisis, Tinubu had pointed out an impeachable offence carried out by Obaseki. Tinubu, in a statement had said Obaseki committed an impeachable offence by ordering the renovation of the Assembly complex.

A volunteer group, Southeast Coronavirus Intervention Network (SCIN) has said that the complacent attitude of some Nigeria leaders have undermined the fight against coronavirus in the country. This was as the group accused the leaders of playing politics with the pandemic, which has left the people to assume that the virus was not real. Nze Meekam Mgbenwelu, the coordinator of the SCIN stated this on Tuesday, while briefing journalists in Owerri, the Imo state capital. Mgbenwelu, who is former Commissioner for Technology Development in Imo State, posited that much has not been done by the leaders in the country towards the prevention of the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic. He pointed out that poor awareness campaign has been a major challenge inhibiting the fight against the pandemic especially in rural communities. The ex-Imo Commissioner attributed the increase in index cases of the virus across the country to the government’s complacency and inadequate provision of resources to the relevant agencies involved in the fight against coronavirus. “Till date, some people especially the rural dwellers still regard COVID-19 as a ploy by Nigerian leaders to siphon our commonwealth. This is not true anyway but coronavirus is real. “Yet, government should step up actions towards the containment of the virus. The community awareness outreaches, radio phone-in programs and jingles so far engaged in by the government need to be intensified for stronger awareness. “Our leaders need not play politics with everything. COVID-19 is a life-threatening disease that should be taken seriously. That’s why SCIN has waded into the issue in collaboration with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and Ford Foundation,” he disclosed.

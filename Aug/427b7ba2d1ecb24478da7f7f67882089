Two people are said to have drowned as a result of flood, which destroyed two major bridges in the northern part of Adamawa State. A local source said it was a torrential rainfall, which caused riverbanks to overflow. The source said the flood washed off the two bridges and drowned two persons and a vehicle. The state government, which issued a statement Monday evening, confirmed the damage to two bridges and vowed that they would be repaired but could not confirm the loss of lives. The government said communities had been cut off after the bridges linking Michika and Madagali Local Government Areas were thus affected by the flood. A statement from the Government House in Yola said Governor Ahmadu Fintiri was particular that Madagali Local Government Area which has been cut off completely with the collapse of the major bridge at Wurogayandi, will receive immediate intervention. The statement, which was signed by the Chief Press Secretary to Governor Fintiri, Humwashi Wonosikou, appealed to the affected communities to exercise patience as government is doing everything possible to address their plight.

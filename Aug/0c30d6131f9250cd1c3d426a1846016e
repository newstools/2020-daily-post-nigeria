An anti-graft group, Kick Corruption Out of Nigeria (KCON) has petitioned President Muhammadu Buhari, over the Edo State governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Osagie Ize-Iyamu. The petition was submitted on Saturday, 24 hours after Buhari endorsed Ize-Iyamu at the President Villa, Abuja. It noted that the president must have endorsed Ize-Iyamu without knowledge of his corruption trial or has surrendered the battle for partisan exigencies. DAILY POST reports that the trial of Ize-Iyamu is before the Federal High Court sitting in Benin. The other defendants are former Edo Deputy Governor, Lucky Imasuen; ex-Edo People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Chairman, Dan Orbih; incumbent chairman, Tony Aziegbemi; and Efe Erimuoghae-Anthony. KCON spokesman, Lawrence Chukwu, declared the photograph of Buhari giving the APC flag to Ize-Iyamu, as “a tragedy and an indication that once you are on the side of powers that be, you can continue to steal the country blind.” The petition said the fact that Kano Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje was beside Buhari and Ize-Iyamu demonstrated that corruption is being celebrated in Nigeria’s number one office and residence. The group accompanied the petition with Ize-Iyamu’s charge sheet, witness statement, banker’s statement, bail application, cash officer’s statement and bank MD’s statement. The petition also accused the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), of exerting influence on the Federal High Court to frustrate the Ize-Iyamu’s case. The federal government warned against the use security of electoral officers to rig the September 19 election in Edo State.

Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar of Jigawa State has said that only ungrateful persons will blame president Muhammad Buhari over the country’s inflation. The Governor stated this at the official flag-off of planting 400,000 fertilizer trees known as “Gawo” by the Hon. Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Sabo Nanono, at Garki local government area of Jigawa State. According to the consumer price index report released by the National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria’s inflation rate rose by 12.82% in July 2020 which is the highest rate recorded in 27 months. While reacting, the Governor said the country’s inflation rate was caused by the low crude oil price in the world. “The falling crude oil price was responsible for the inflation of food items and other commodities in the country, not President Muhammadu Buhari as is bandied by mischief markers” he noted. “Previous leaders did nothing for the brighter future of the country at the time when oil was on its peak, they did nothing to improved Agriculture and industries that will help in reducing import ” “That is why more goods are still being imported into the country, consider the dollar price. If they were all produced here there is no way the price of the dollar will affect the prices of commodities in the country’ Badaru stated. He said various policies and programs were introduced by the Buhari led administration to improve the situation of the country which suffered neglect in the past. “You have to compare the preceding years of previous administrations and the present 5 years of Buhari’s administration for you to appreciate what the president is doing for the development of this country” Badaru said the Federal Government is making efforts to improve agriculture to enhance the production of food locally to boost the country’s economy and curtail the inflation. He, therefore, urged Nigerians to open their eyes from acts of mischief makers and complement Government efforts.

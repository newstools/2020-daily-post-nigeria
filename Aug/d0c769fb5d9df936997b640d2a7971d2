The Kogi State Police Command has arrested a thirty-two years old welder identified as Murtala Dare for allegedly stabbing a carpenter and father of two Lukeman Kabiru, to death. The incident happened on Sunday night at a popular drinking spot beside the amusement park in Lokoja. It was gathered that the accused allegedly stabbed the deceased on the neck. According to an eye witness, “At about 11:00 pm on Sunday, Dare wanted to fight a prostitute for taking a customer behind a building for short time service” Dare’s action according to eyewitnesses was interrupted by the deceased. It was gathered that the said Dare had a penchant for collecting fees for the use of the open space. “When Dare interrupted the sex rump and threatened to beat the call girl, the deceased (Lukeman) stopped Dare from being violent. This angered Dare who was alleged to have broken a bottle and stabbed Lukeman Kabiru on the neck. “It is surprising to state here that Dare and Lukeman are neighbours, who own shops opposite the notorious drinking spot where prostitutes operate. Confirming the incident, the Kogi State Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO), DSP William Aya said the suspect was arrested in his hideouts at the back of Total Filling Station in Lokoja.

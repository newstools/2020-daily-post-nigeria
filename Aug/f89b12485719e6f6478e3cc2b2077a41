The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, has called on all members of the church to resume attending services on Sunday. This follows the decision of the Lagos and Ogun States governments to lift the restriction on worship centres. Adeboye noted that some services will continue online, but urged congregants to be physically present in church. The cleric stated this in a video message on Tuesday titled, ‘From Lockdown to Leaping Up’. “I encourage you all to go back to church for fellowship and begin to enjoy the benefits of corporate prayers again. The Almighty God in Hebrews 10 vs 25 said that we should not forsake the assembly of one another. “There are those who will talk to you and say ‘why don’t you continue to stay at home? After all, you can pray at home and God will hear you’. Yes, I agree. Anywhere you cry unto Him, He will answer. But He says specifically in Matthew 21 vs 13 that His house is called the House of Prayers. “He himself designated the House of God as a place where you will pray and the answer will come fast. That is the reason why David says in Psalm 122 vs 1 that I was glad when they said unto me, let us go to the house of the Lord because He knows that when you go to the house of the Lord, you will be in his presence where there is fullness of joy,” Adeboye said. He, however, advised congregants to observe all protocols relating to the COVID-19 pandemic. Adeboye urged members to wear masks to services, while they would be given hand sanitizers before entering the church.

Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has tested positive for Coronavirus. This has led to the player being left out of France’s squad for the Nations League games against Sweden and Croatia. Pogba has been replaced by Eduardo Camavinga. The news was confirmed by Les Bleus head coach, Didier Deschamps, after he announced the squad for the games. “I had to make a last-minute change to this list, because Paul Pogba was planned to be in this list but unfortunately for him, he took a test (for COVID-19) yesterday which turned out to be positive today, so at the last minute he was replaced by Eduardo Camavinga,” Deschamps said. France will play Sweden in Solna on September 5 and Croatia in Paris on September 8.

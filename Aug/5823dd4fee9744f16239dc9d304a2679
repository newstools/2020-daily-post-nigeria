The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has hinted that the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) orientation camps may be reopened in the next phase of the eased lockdown. This was disclosed by the National Coordinator of the PTF, Sani Aliyu, during a press briefing in Abuja on Thursday. During the press conference, the extension of the second phase of eased lockdown by another four weeks was announced. “We have advised NYSC to start planning ahead of resumption in future phases, but not within this current phase of the response. “We will work closely with them to design policies that may allow this to happen in the future,” Aliyu said. On March 18, the NYSC management temporarily suspended the 2020 Batch A Stream One orientation, in order to curtail the spread of COVID-19. Two days later, the biometric clearance and community development service (CDS) for all corps members, was also postponed.

Chelsea have incredibly entered the race to sign defender, Malang Sarr, from French Ligue 1 side, Nice. According to Telefoot, Chelsea have agreed to a four-deal with Sarr. Sarr has been a free agent since rejecting an extension deal with Nice. The 21-year-old has been targeted by a host of clubs across Europe, but Frank Lampard’s side are now favourites to land Sarr. Sarr’s move to the Blues is subject to a medical, but he is expected to give his final approval to the deal before travelling to the West London club to undergo the formalities of his move. Meanwhile, Chelsea have already signed Hakim Ziyech and Timo Werner this summer from Ajax and RB Leipzig respectively.

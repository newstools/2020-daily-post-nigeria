The newly-appointed Minister of Justice and Solicitor-General for the Government of Alberta, in Canada, Kaycee Madu, has said that he looks forward to the day when hard work is rewarded in Nigeria. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had congratulated Madu following his new appointment. Madu made history when he became the first African-born provincial minister in Canadian history, and is also the Provincial Secretary and Keeper of the Great Seal of the Province of Alberta. “Thank you for all the support and prayers coming from Nigeria and Nigerians in the Diaspora,” Madu tweeted. “I look forward to the day when Nigeria and Africa become places where hard work and merit are rewarded. Chukwu Gozie! #ableg #cdnpoli,” he added. Also former Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, had said that Madu’s appointment has the capacity to impact the world.

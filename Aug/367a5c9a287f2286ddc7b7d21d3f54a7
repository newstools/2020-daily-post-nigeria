The management of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) has rubbished the public notice on the sack of its Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Oluwatoyin Odundipe. The letter dated August 12, 2020, was signed by Oladejo Azeez, UNILAG Registrar. Azeez is also the secretary to the governing council. He announced that Ogundipe has been removed from office “with immediate effect.” Interestingly, Ogundipe signed the rejoinder on behalf of the management. In a terse statement made available to DAILY POST, the VC declared that the council’s decision “is untrue and a figment of his imagination.” Ogundipe advised staff, students, parents, guardians and the general public to “disregard the mischievous disinformation about the sitting Vice-Chancellor of Unilag, contained in that notice.” The statement stressed that “Professor Ogundipe remains UNILAG’s Vice-Chancellor.” The institution’s management and the council chaired by Wale Babalakin have been at loggerheads. The situation caused the suspension of the UNILAG 51st convocation ceremony. This triggered condemnations and left Nigerians wondering why authorities allowed the face-off to degenerate. Last month, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) warned Babalakin against stepping into the school premises. They accused him of causing confusion and instigating a crisis in UNILAG.

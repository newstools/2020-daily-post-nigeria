Barcelona are out of the Champions League, after suffering a humiliating 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich on Friday. Thomas Muller set the Bundesliga champions on their way to an emphatic victory with the opening goal in the 4th minute. Barca went level, thanks to a David Alaba own goal. However, Bayern responded in ruthless fashion, scoring three times before the half-time whistle. Ivan Perisic, Serge Muller and Muller got the goals. Luis Suarez pulled one back for the LaLiga side, but again, Joshua Kimmich, Robert Lewandowski and Philippe Coutinho (twice) restored the Bavariansâ€™ commanding lead. Bayern will now face the winner of Manchester City vs Lyon in the semi-final of the competition.

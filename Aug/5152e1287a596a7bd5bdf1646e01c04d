Popular American musician, Miley Cyrus has confirmed that she and her boyfriend, Cody Simpson have parted ways after less than a year together. The 27-year-old singer who confirmed their breakup in an Instagram live video on Thursday night said she and Cody were going to “work on” themselves during their time apart. The singer also made reference to her split from her ex-husband, Liam Hemsworth last year, saying: “A year ago, almost to this exact date, the media tried to tell my story for me, and control my narrative, and I’m just not accepting that.” According to her, the news about their breakup was already all over the internet and this time, she would want to address the issue herself. “So today, it came out that I and my boyfriend have broken up. “It was confirmed by a ‘reliable source’ even though no one is reliable in a relationship except the individuals who are participating in it. “But right now, two halves can’t make a whole, and we’re individually just working on ourselves to become the people that we wanna be, like everybody else at this age,” she said. Miley and Cody started dating in October 2019 shortly after the singer’s split from ex-husband, Liam Hemsworth.

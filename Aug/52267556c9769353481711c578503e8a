Manchester United have given Antonio Conte’s Inter Milan a fresh condition to sign striker, Alexis Sanchez on a permanent deal. Sanchez spent this season on loan at Inter Milan under former Chelsea manager, Conte. The 31-year-old is keen on a permanent move to the Serie A club, as he looks to resurrect his career. The Chilean international joined Man United on a free transfer from Arsenal in 2018 and has two years remaining on his £500,00-a-week deal with the Red Devils. But Sunday Express is now reporting that Man United are playing ‘hard-ball’ and demanding Inter Milan pay £15million if they want to sign Sanchez on a permanent deal. Sanchez no longer sees his future at Man United. The former Barcelona star has told club bosses that he wants to play his football elsewhere. Inter Milan are prepared to sign Sanchez on a permanent deal, provided he is prepared to take a pay cut.

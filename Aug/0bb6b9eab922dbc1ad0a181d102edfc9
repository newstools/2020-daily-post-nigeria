The Chairman of the South East Governors Forum and Governor of Ebonyi State, Chief David Umahi, on Thursday rejected the idea of joint security network in Nigeria. Umahi made this known during the official inauguration of Ebonyi State chapter of community policing outfit, which took place at the Ecumenical Centre, Abakaliki, the Ebonyi State capital. The governor, however, called on the Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, to remove Ebonyi State Police from Anambra State zone 13, adding that the state will prefer it to remain in Umahia. “I had a little disagreement with the AIG Zone 13 in Awka; we cannot belong to Awka. You must know your level to succeed in life. “I moved our people from Calabar into Umuahia, I don’t know who smuggled us back to Awka; I have no idea, we cannot be in Awka. “One, the roads; two, insecurity, our people going there; three is so much money around that place. Let us be in Umahia where we will be able to sleep in hotels.” He, however, rejected formation of regional security in Nigeria “I have continued to say that there is nothing like joint security network. “It is only to share information, every state is sovereign. Let nobody deceive you. If there is a robbery incident in Enugu, through our cooperation, they will let us know. There is certain thing that we will cooperate. “If you think that there is one recruitment centre, to recruit people for the entire zone, you are lying. It is all deceit and politics. But I don’t play politics because I’m not a politician. “I tell our people the truth. I will be asking our DIG to form our community security network, it is not possible. I have told Mr. President that there is no way states can fund the payment of state policing,” he said. Umahi, however, challenged the national leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, to return to Nigeria and continue his fight. “You are outside the country and want to push us into war. We ask you to come back and lead the war,” he added.

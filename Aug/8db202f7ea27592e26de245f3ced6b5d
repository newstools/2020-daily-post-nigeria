Abia State Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu, has commissioned the 1.5 MVA Injection Sub-Station procured and installed by his administration for the Broadcasting Corporation of Abia State (BCA). The Governor, while commissioning the project, described power as the live wire of a broadcast station. He thanked the BCA management for the marvelous job it was doing in the dissemination of information and commended them for supporting the government to teach Abia school children through the radio classroom programme. Ikpeazu further urged the management of BCA and the host community to protect and nurture the sub-station to serve them better. He expressed joy that what seemed a mirage 30 years ago has now become a reality. Speaking at the event, the Director-General of BCA, Sir Anyaso Anyaso, described the commissioning as historic, adding that the significance of the project is indeed enormous. He noted that power is essential to the survival of ventures such as theirs, especially at a time like this when the resources of states and the nation have been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic. The Director-General informed that for almost 30 years of its existence, the station has been running on diesel and expressed gratitude for the rare feat achieved by Governor Ikpeazu, adding that it will go a long way in sustaining the station despite limited resources. Sir Anyaso said the station has since recovered lost hours during the day and extended broadcast time to 12 midnight daily disclosing that what the Governor has done is like a life insurance policy that would certainly herald the reemergence of a broadcast industry giant, the station born to lead and set it on the path to attaining its true potential. He added that the station has launched an online App that will enable people outside its coverage area to listen to its broadcast.

Barcelona’s new coach, Ronald Koeman, has confirmed plans to give Antoine Griezmann a new position in his team after a difficult first season at Camp Nou. Koeman also said he would change Frenkie de Jong’s position at Barcelona ahead of next season. Griezmann has struggled for consistency since joining Barcelona from Atletico Madrid last summer and has been deployed mostly on the wings for the Blaugrana. De Jong has been positioned mainly on the left and right side of the midfield. “With all due respect he [Griezmann] is not a traditional winger, so you have to play him in his own position where he is used to playing, in a role that suits him and where he can showcase his abilities,” Koeman told NOS about Griezmann. “You have to know your players as a coach and ensure you get the best out of them.” Speaking on De Jong, Koeman added: “The plan is to start playing Frenkie de Jong in the position that he plays with the national team as well. “I remember attending a Barcelona game and I saw him play a position where I wouldn’t play him as a coach. “You have spent a lot of money on a young player. You should then play him in his own position, where he can perform in a way you’d expect from him. “He’s shown at Ajax and with the Dutch national team which position suits him best, and that’s where he will be playing at Barcelona as well. There’s stiff competition for that role, so he will have to be in great shape and form. But it will be in a position that suits him.”

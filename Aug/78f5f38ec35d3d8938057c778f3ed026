The Edo State governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has congratulated Victor Edoror, the newly-elected factional Speaker of the House of Assembly. In a statement signed by the Chairman of the Media Campaign Council, Prince Mayaki, he described Edoror’s emergence as the end of a deformed and lopsided democracy. Ize-Iyamu also said it was a victory for Edo State and all constituencies previously sidelined. “His emergence marks an end to a lopsided and deformed democracy, ushering in a new and reformed era of inclusive governance and non-discriminatory politics. “Rt. Hon. Victor Edoror’s emergence is also a victory for the people of Edo State, for the constituencies previously sidelined, and for the House-members’ elect who had been unfairly denied their elective right to represent their constituencies in government,” the statement read in part. Ize-Iyamu added that “Edoror knows the sour taste of injustice and as such would not let any Edo person experience such bitter tang.” DAILY POST reported that Edoror emerged, after 17 lawmakers, including the 14 lawmakers-elect whose seat were declared vacant, allegedly impeached Frank Okiye and Roland Asoro as Speaker and Deputy Speaker respectively.

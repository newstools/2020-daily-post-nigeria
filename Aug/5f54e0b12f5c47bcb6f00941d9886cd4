Ten children have been confirmed dead while four others have been seriously injured after lightning struck them while sheltering from a storm during a football game in northern Uganda, on Friday. According to police spokeswoman, Josephine Angucia, the boys, aged 11 to 16, had been sheltering from a storm in a makeshift structure in Arua city, northwest of the capital Kampala on Thursday before the incident happened. Angucia said young boys had been playing football when it began to rain and lightning struck them. She also said four other children were seriously injured on the incident. “The children, were sheltering from the rain in a grass-thatched house when the lightning struck Thursday evening. “They had been playing soccer in a nearby field.” Four other children were injured. “Relatives have been picking up the bodies from the mortuary since yesterday and the burials are taking place from today,” she said. She further explained that deadly lightning is commonly reported in the East African country during the wet seasons, while urging children to avoid playing in the rain. “The football pitches are usually within or near schools. “It’s advisable for schools to fix lightning arrestors so that we offer protection to our children,” she added

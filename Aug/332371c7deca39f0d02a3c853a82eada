Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Wathoni on Friday offered to sleep in Laycon’s bed. Wathoni disclosed her intention during a conversation with Laycon, Vee, and Neo inside. The trio was discussing Laycon’s emotional issues and his likeness for fellow housemate, Erica. Speaking, Wathoni said: “I will sleep in your bed tonight, hope you are not doing this to get back at her(Erica)?” Responding, Laycon said: “This is good, the best news I have had in a while.” Laycon, Erica, and Kiddwaya have been caught in a love triangle for over four weeks. In the past, Erica had picked Kiddwaya ahead of Laycon, whom she described as just friends.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Laycon has advised Erica on her break up with Kiddwaya. Erica, who was sad about her break up with the Benue-born billionaire’s son, had a conversation with Laycon on how stupid she felt choosing Kiddwaya. However, during the conversation, Laycon advised Erica not to feel that way and stop thinking about what others are saying. Laycon said: “Erica look at me, are you happy with Kiddwaya? Do what makes you happy with him. “Don’t think about what others think and be yourself with him.” Laycon’s advice was after Kiddwaya broke up with Erica and asked to be just friends. The long term lovers who have garnered fans from their relationship seem to have gone their separate ways following a conversation on Friday. Erica had expressed her intention for the relationship, saying she wants more than kisses and sex talks, which seems like the only thing Kiddwaya has to offer. However, Kiddwaya on the other hand, had nothing to say.

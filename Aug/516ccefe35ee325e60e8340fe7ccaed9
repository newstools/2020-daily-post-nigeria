Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Brighto has stated that he doesn’t want a relationship in the house because he likes his space. Brighto gave the clarification when Tolanibaj confronted him about the recent love triangle between him, Wathoni and Dorathy. Recall that Dorathy had confronted Wathoni that she had lust for Brighto but promised to back down and save their friendship if Wathoni wants to have a relationship with Brighto. But, after the conversation, Wathoni told Tolanibaj that she was confused about Brighto’s feeling for her. She maintained that she doesn’t want to be caught up in another love triangle in the house. This led to Tolanibaj’s discussion about relationships with Brighto. When asked why he was reluctant to pursue a relationship with Wathoni, Brighto said, “ I already told you I don’t want a relationship in this house. I don’t want all that ‘always staying together thing, eating together and all that’.” He, however, told Tolanibaj that kissing Wathoni was natural and it doesn’t mean he has something for her.

Former Barcelona striker, Samuel Eto’o, has urged the club to do everything possible to ensure captain, Lionel Messi, finishes his career at Camp Nou. DAILY POST recalls that this is coming after Messi told Barcelona that he wants to leave the club this summer following their exit from the Champions League at the hands of Bayern Munich last Friday. But Eto’o, who played alongside Messi during his time at Barcelona, is strictly against such an idea of the Argentine captain leaving the club. The Cameroon legend said if Messi were to leave the Blaugrana, then Barcelona should change the club’s name. “I love Leo as if he were my son,” Eto’o told TyC Sports. “I always want the best for Messi, but the club is Messi. If Messi leaves Barcelona, then we need to change the club’s name. “There is a need to do everything possible to ensure Messi finishes his career at Barcelona. “We are lucky that we currently have the best player of all time.”

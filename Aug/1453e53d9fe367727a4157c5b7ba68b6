The Department of State Services (DSS) has invited former Speaker of House of Representatives, Ghali Umar Naa’ba. This followed his condemnation of President Muhammadu Buhari over insecurity in Nigeria. He described Nigeria as a failed state. National Consultative Front spokesperson, Tanko Yunusa, announced the invitation in a statement on Saturday. Yinusa said the former Speaker will honour the DSS invitation on Monday by 12:00pm. He noted: “Please, be notified that the DSS on Friday sent an invitation to NCFront Co-Chair and former Speaker of Nigeria, Rt Hon Ghali Umar Na’abba, after his very profound interview on Channels Television on Thursday in regard to the NCFront agenda to bring about a new Nigeria that works for all.” Yunusa called on all all NCF organs, structures and allies nationwide to be on alert.

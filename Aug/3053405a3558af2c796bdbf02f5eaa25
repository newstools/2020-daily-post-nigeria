FIFA President, Gianni Infantino enjoys the unconditional support of football associations around the world. The General Secretary, Fatma Samoura, declared the body’s position in a statement. In July, Swiss authorities confirmed that proceedings had been launched against Infantino. A special prosecutor is looking into the president’s meetings with Swiss Attorney-General Michael Lauber. Samoura, a Gambian, disclosed that she attended 25 virtual meetings in the last few days during which Infantino spoke to presidents of 180 national associations. She noted that to hear all of them express total and unconditional support to the FIFA head “is certainly heart-warming.” “There is clearly a strong feeling among FIFA member-associations that under President Infantino, FIFA is by far a more transparent, accountable and especially better-governed institution.” Samoura stressed that the Swiss case was not considered a big issue among the associations. The scribe said the general opinion was that “Infantino will come out stronger from this difficult moment.”

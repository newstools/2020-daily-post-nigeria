Kevin Mayer, the Chief Executive Officer of the Chinese-owned video app, TikTok, has resigned from his position amid pressure from the US. Mayer announced his decision in a letter to employees, saying his decision to leave comes after the “political environment has sharply changed.” President Donald Trump had announced that he was ready to sign an executive order banning the app. China, reacting, warned the United States over its demand that TikTok must be sold to a U.S corporation. Its Foreign Ministry’s spokesman, Wang Wenbin urged the US to refrain from setting such an example that other countries could follow against its (US) businesses. His resignation comes after US President, Donald Trump ordered a ban on TikTok, unless parent company Bytedance sells its US operations to an American company within 90 days over claims that the popular video app presents a national security threat that could share information about users with China`s government. The letter reads in parts: “I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require, and what it means for the global role I signed up for. “Against this backdrop, and as we expect to reach a resolution very soon, it is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company.” Mayer, a former Disney executive, joined TikTok as CEO in May. TikTok in response accepted his resignation and announced that U.S. General Manager Vanessa Pappas will replace him immediately on an interim basis. “We appreciate that the political dynamics of the last few months have significantly changed what the scope of Kevin’s role would be going forward, and fully respect his decision. We thank him for his time at the company and wish him well,” TikTok said in a statement.

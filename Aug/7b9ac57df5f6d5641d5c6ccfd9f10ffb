Chief Ademola Odunade, the President of a Mapo Customary Court in Ibadan, on Friday dissolved a 13-year-old marriage between one Abidemi Dada, an engineer, and Opeyemi over sex starvation and lack of respect. Odunade, in his judgement, held that the bond of love between Dada and Opeyemi has been irreparably dented. He gave custody of the first two children to the petitioner and asked the respondent to take the other two children. “This court did everything possible to keep the couple together, but none of you was willing to shift your position,” Odunade said. “It’s my advice to men and women and even already married people to learn how to exercise voluntary control over their temperament.” DAILY POST recalls that Abidemi, who resides in Oke-Ado, had filed the suit on March 19, arguing that his wife had starved him of sex and disrespected him. Abidemi said: “She refused to abide by the court’s earlier advice to change. She has continuously neglected her role as a wife. “Things went from bad to worse. She moved out of my room and slept in another bedroom. She has also refused to take care of our three children. “When she complained of some health challenge to me, I took her to the University Teaching Hospital (UCH) for treatment, and the Doctor informed me that she was okay again. “In fact, Opeyemi told me that she felt like stabbing me to death. I do not want to die before my time, my lord.” Opeyemi, who lives in the Oke-bola area in Ibadan consented to the suit and did not deny any of the allegations levelled against her. She, however, submitted that her actions were intentional and for her sanity.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, has denied claims that its personnel were involved in “stop and search” operations around Lekki axis of Lagos State. Reports had emerged on Wednesday that EFCC personnel were stopping and searching innocent Nigerians in Lagos State. The agency in a statement by Head, Media & Publicity, Dele Oyewale on Wednesday called on Nigerians to ignore such insinuations as the EFCC is a professional law-enforcement agency and should not be linked with any traffic management operation on roads. Part of the statement reads, “The attention of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has been drawn to some spurious news circulating in the social media, linking its Operatives with some contrived “Stop and Search” operations around Lekki axis of Lagos State. “We wish to state very clearly that our Operatives were not and can never be involved in such operations.”

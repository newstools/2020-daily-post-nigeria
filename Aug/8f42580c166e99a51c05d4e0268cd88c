Chelsea have confirmed that their goalkeeper, Jamal Blackman, has left the club to join Rotherham United on loan until the end of the 2020/21 season. Chelsea made this known in a statement via its official website on Monday. The statement reads: “Chelsea goalkeeper, Jamal Blackman has joined Rotherham United on loan for the 2020/21 campaign. “The goalkeeper heads back to Yorkshire having spent time there with Sheffield United and Leeds in recent seasons. “A broken leg sustained in November 2018 has limited his involvement since, though he did feature 10 times for League One Bristol Rovers in the second half of last campaign.” Blackman, 26, won both the FA Youth Cup and Under-21 Premier League during his time in Chelsea Academy.

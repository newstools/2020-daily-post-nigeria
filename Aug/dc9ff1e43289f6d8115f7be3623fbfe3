Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has expressed sadness over the death of a member of the Governor’s Advisory Council (GAC), Lanre Razak. The Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) top-shot passed away on Saturday. Razak, the Balogun of Epe, died at Reddington Hospital, Lagos after a brief illness. In a condolence message by his spokesman, Gboyega Akosile, Sanwo-Olu said the deceased stood for what was right and championed policies that would impact positively on the people. “He was a loyal party man and committed democrat, with a deep understanding of the state’s political landscape. He was an extremely loyal politician, who did his best for our party, the All Progressives Congress. “Chief Razak served his people and Lagos State passionately as Chairman of Epe Local Government Area and Commissioner of Public Transportation. “He brought a lot of development to Epe as a council boss and also made a lot of positive contributions to turn around public transportation in Lagos during his tenure as member of the State Executive Council.” Sanwo-Olu condoled with the family, APC national leader, Bola Tinubu, other GAC members, Lagos APC and the people of Epe. He prayed God to grant the soul of Razak eternal rest in Aljannah firdaus.

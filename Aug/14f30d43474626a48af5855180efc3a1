The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has condemned the invasion of the Edo State House of Assembly security men on Thursday. DAILY POST reports that Nigeria Police officers besieged the premises on Thursday. House members loyal to the All Progressive Congress (APC) former national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, allegedly plotted to seize control in a bid to move against Governor Godwin Obaseki. PDP spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement, saluted Edo people. He said they came out enmasse “to resist attempts by sacked national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and the APC candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu.” Ologbondiyan noted that the duo attempted to grab the state legislature and truncate democratic order. PDP asserted that the resistance, in solidarity with Obaseki, was a loud message to the APC and Ize-Iyamu that the people of Edo State will never surrender to political godfathers and their cronies. “Today’s spontaneous resistance is also a signal of their readiness to collectively confront and dismantle all APC evil rigging schemes in the September 19 election.” PDP called the development “a further pointer” to Oshiomhole and Ize-Iyamu that the people cannot be cowed in their readiness to unleash violence and derail the election. The party added that the masses proved that Edo belongs to them “and not political destitutes who believe that they can use compromised security operatives to foist an unwanted leadership over the state.”

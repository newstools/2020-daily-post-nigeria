A former Manchester City midfielder, David Silva, has tested positive to COVID-19. His new club, Real Sociedad, made the announcement in a tweet via its official Twitter handle on Monday. The 34-year-old, who joined Real Sociedad on a free transfer last two weeks, returned a positive test after arriving in San Sebastian. The Spaniard is not displaying any symptoms and is self-isolating. “Real Sociedad informs that @21LVA has tested positive for COVID-19 in the test carried out at Policlínica Gipuzkoa. The player is asymptomatic and is self-isolating,” Real Sociedad tweeted. Silva left Manchester City at the end of last season after a decade of service in which he won four English Premier League (EPL) titles at Etihad.

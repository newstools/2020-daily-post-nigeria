Students who attend Lagos State Government-owned schools will be promoted to the next classes using continuous assessments. This was revealed by the Commissioner for Education, Mrs Folashade Adefisayo while speaking on Channels Television on Thursday. Adefisayo also noted that there was still no definite date for the full reopening of schools. “(For) the reopening (of schools), we are working with the Federal Government. So I cannot unilaterally say that we are doing this or that, but we are planning. “There are two scenarios. If we don’t have a third term, it means that we have to push the next session to next year. “But if the students do not do the third term examination, they will use their CA (continuous assessment),” she said. Both private and public schools in Lagos were closed down in March after Nigeria first confirmed its first COVID-19 case in the state. However, students in exit classes have resumed since Tuesday, August 4.

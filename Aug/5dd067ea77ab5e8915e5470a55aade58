Arsenal offer to pay off Ozil’s £18m contract Arsenal are ready to reach an agreement over Mesut Ozil’s £18m contract nightmare, the UK Mirror reports. The Gunners will make an offer to pay the German playmaker off or reach a deal to subsidise his £350,000-a-week wages if he joins another club. Ozil is into the last year of his deal with the club and is not ready to leave the Emirates. The 31-year-old is ready to sit out the last months of his contract, but Arsenal want to find a compromise to help free up money in their wage bill for transfer business this summer. Ozil did not play a single minute for the Gunners after football returned in June. He was also not allowed to join the rest of the squad to Wembley for the FA Cup final against Chelsea and travelled to Turkey instead.

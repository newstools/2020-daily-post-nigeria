The internal crisis rocking the National Working Committee of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, has taken a twist, as the Acting National Treasurer of the All Progressives Grand Alliance, APGA, Smart Iheoma, has berated the party’s National Chairman, Victor Oye. He accused Oye of alleged impunity, which he said thwarted the chances of APGA under his watch during the 2019 general elections in the country. Iheoma, in a statement issued to newsmen, in Umuahia, insisted that Oye had ceased to function as the National Chairman following an order of court that sacked him from office. The APC chieftain asserted that, “National Executive Committee, NEC, had constituted an interim management team that would run the party pending when properly convened congresses and convention is conducted”. He claimed that Victor Oye has become a threat to the future of the party and accused the latter of alleged extortion and illegal substitution of APGA candidates with those who never participated in the 2018 primaries. The APGA National Treasurer maintained that the activities of the party national chairman with other officers, had caused prominent leaders and members defecting to other political parties in search of good governance. But, the National Publicity Secretary of APGA, Tex Okechukwu, in a release on Tuesday, dismissed the allegations leveled against the party’s NWC and posited that Smart Iheoma lacked power to speak on behalf of APGA, as the latter was long time suspended for anti-party activity. Okechukwu challenged the accusers to come forward with any evidences that the present members of the National Working Committee perpetrated fraud during APGA 2018 primaries.

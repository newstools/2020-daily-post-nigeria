The Chairman of Kano State chapter of IPMAN, Bashir Danmallam, conveyed the directive in a statement on Wednesday. The statement said that the directive follows the new price modulation announced by the Petroleum Products Marketing Company (PPMC). “I have accordingly, instructed our members in Kano to comply, by selling the product at N150 per litre,” he said. The Chairman explained further that the directive was also in compliance with the government’s earlier statement that it would review upward or downward the price of the fuel on monthly basis, going by the price at the international market.

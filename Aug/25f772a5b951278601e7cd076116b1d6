Copenhagen manager, Stale Solbakken, has reacted to the penalty won by Manchester United striker, Anthony Martial, during the Red Devils’ Europa League last-8 final 1-0 victory against his team on Monday night in Germany. Martial won a penalty for Man United early in the first half of extra-time, which was converted by Bruno Fernandes as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side qualified for the Europa League semi-final, where they will face the winner between Sevilla and Wolves. But, Solbakken claimed that Martial did not try to stay on his feet for too long during the encounter in bid to win a penalty against Copenhagen. According to him, his own players would have been more successful if they would follow the same approach as the France International. “If my players had been a little bit more clinical, they could have gone down and got a penalty,” Solbakken told beIN SPORTS. “You cannot encourage them to go down. It is a fine balance between being too honest. “I do not think Martial tried to stay on his feet for too long. But that is life, and it can be given.” He added: “This game is not about penalties. This game is about a Scandinavian team with players who have never played at this level, and make a real performance, and it is quite a good 90 minutes. “United win because they win the first 15 minutes of extra-time.”

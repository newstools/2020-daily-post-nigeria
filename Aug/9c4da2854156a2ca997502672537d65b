The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, on Sunday described the reopening of Akanu Ibiam International Airport in Enugu after one year of closure as an “affirmative action that President Muhammadu Buhari’s love for Igbos is unparalleled.” The group noted that the action of the president has contradicted critics whose interests are to paint the Federal Government as enemies of Igbos and sectional in the distribution of amenities. OYC’s remark was contained in a statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, OYC President General and Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, Secretary-General of the group. The statement reads: “OYC wishes to categorically state that we have the mandate of Igbo elders to persuade those who unjustly used Ohanaeze Ndigbo’s name as signatories to the ongoing suit against President Muhammadu Buhari without proper consultative approval from the various stakeholders to withdraw. “Igbo Youths salute the Southeast Governors Forum for the harmonious relationship between them and President Muhammadu Buhari irrespective of the rogue operations of few Igbo groups to label them saboteurs. “OYC is full of hope that International flights will resume operations at Enugu international Airport at the resumption of International flights on September 5th 2020.”

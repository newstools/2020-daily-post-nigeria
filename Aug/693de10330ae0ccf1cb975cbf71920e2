The Biafra Nations Youth League, BNYL, on Sunday, lambasted Chris Ekpenyong, Senator representing Akwa Ibom West, on his recent call for President of Igbo extraction which many believed would end the agitation for Biafra. BNYL Chief Press Secretary, Dianabasi Odung charged Ekpenyong to drop the call, stressing that the former President Goodluck Jonathan’s presidency could not solve the problems of the Southeast and Southsouth. In a statement he signed and forwarded to DAILY POST, Odung disclosed that Akwa Ibom people are backward in Nigeria politics, adding that BNYL would have been glad if Ekpenyong was calling for a referendum than Igbo presidency in 2023. “He is my Senator, from Ikot Ekpene, but I am disappointed he has joined some Igbo politicians to agitate for Presidency of Igbo extraction. When Jonathan came in, we thought our problems would be solved, but the reverse was the case, he pleased the northerners more and yet was kicked out, so what makes these politicians of the east believe that Igbo Presidency will solve our problems? “Ekpenyong should pass bill for referendum in the Senate if he is sympathetic, the Igbo and Akwa Ibom people, as well as other tribes that fought during the war are backward in Nigerian politics, they can never allow any Easterner to rule, we know that Tinubu is already positioning himself from the west, let’s talk about Biafra in Akwa Ibom, our fathers fought and died for it,” Odung said. He warned that BNYL won’t participate in any plan for Igbo presidency in 2023, adding that they hope to restore Biafra before then.

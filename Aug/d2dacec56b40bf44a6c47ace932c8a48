After spending four days with their captors, kidnapped wives and daughter of the slain member of the Bauchi State House of Assembly, Hon Musa Mante Baraza, have been released. The two women and the baby, Rashida Musa Mante (40), Rahina Musa Mante (35) and Fausar Musa Mante were kidnapped by some unknown gunmen who stormed their residence in Dass, the headquarters of Dass Local Government Area of the state and murdered their husband Thursday last week. Their release was confirmed by the Chief of Staff to Governor Bala Mohammed, Dr Ladan Salihu, in a series of tweets. Salihu informed that Governor Mohammed had directed that the women and the baby should be given adequate medical care, while security should be beefed up around them. “Alhamdulillah! The wives of Hon Musa Baraza, Bauchi House member murdered 4 days ago in Dass have regained freedom. “The one-year-old baby abducted along with them was also released,” the Chief of Staff tweeted. “Gov Bala Mohammed has directed doctors and security to give them adequate care and attention,” he added. Governor Mohammed had expressed shock over the murder of Hon Baraza, saying that his death was a great loss to the state. He, however, promised that the state government would work in collaboration with security agencies with a view to fishing out those involved in the killing of Baraza for them to be brought to justice. “With this unfortunate incident, Bauchi State government will work in close collaboration with security agencies to identify those involved in the killing so that they will face the full wrath of the law,” the governor had stated in his condolence message. He then prayed the Almighty Allah to receive the soul of the departed and comfort his family. The late lawmaker, who was the Chairman, House Committee on Public Petitions, was laid to rest in Dass on Friday in accordance with Islamic rites.

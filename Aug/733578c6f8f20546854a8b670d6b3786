Nigerians in Diaspora Commission NIDCOM, has reacted to the viral video of stranded Nigerian immigrants in Dubai who were allegedly chased into the desert. A Nigerian in Dubai made the video claiming they have been chased out to the desert. Recall that UAE authorities in July had announced that Nigerians with expired visas were given up till August 17 to leave their country. Reacting via her Twitter handle, Abike Dabiri-Erewa said some Nigerians have refused to avail themselves the opportunity to return home. According to her, the United Arab Emirates authorities have provided three free flights to evacuate illegal Nigerian immigrants back home but some have refused to take the opportunity. “UAE given illegal migrants March 1 to leave extended till Aug 17 And UAE even gave 3 free flights. “ They’ve been returning (179 came in yesterday free of charge )but some still bent on hiding and breaking the laws. You shouldn’t stay illegally anywhere. “That video was five days ago. Once they realize they can get free flights, they go calling themselves to go sleep in front of the mission. “The illegal ones are affecting the legal ones negatively with such behavior. “Pls let’s obey laws of other countries,”she said.

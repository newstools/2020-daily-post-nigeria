The Brazilian signed a three-year deal with the North London club, having left Chelsea as a free agent last week. Reacting, Willian, 32, said he can’t wait to go on the pitch and help the club shine again, adding that Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, had said a lot of good things about him. “[I like] the way they play, everything is amazing – the stadium, and I think that with Arteta, Arsenal have a great opportunity to fight again for titles in the Premier League and in Europe so I am very happy because of that,” Willian told Arenal Digital. “I am excited to start. I cannot wait to go on the pitch and do my thing to help my team-mates and to help this club to shine again. That is what I want. “When I talked to Arteta, the conversation was good. He gave me the confidence to come to Arsenal. He said a lot of good things for me, and that is why I have come to Arsenal.” He added: “I come to help in every position. “I can play on the right. I can play in the middle and I can play on the left side as well. So I want to help the team in any position where they put me to play. I will try to do my best.”

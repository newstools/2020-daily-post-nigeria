Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Erica has said Lucy causes drama in the house to trend. Erica said this during her diary session with Biggie on Friday. According to her, she expects Lucy who is one of the oldest in the house to act her age but she acts like a child. Erica said: “Lucy is the oldest in the house but acts like a baby. She is not good at singing or dancing but was there insulting Kiddwaya. “I will say this to her face too, she spent four hours complaining about Kiddwaya and I feel she’s doing all of this to trend. “Lucy is trying to be that person in the house that causes drama in order to trend outside the house. Erica added that though Lucy acts very difficult to be around with, she would always approach her and say her wrongdoings to her face.

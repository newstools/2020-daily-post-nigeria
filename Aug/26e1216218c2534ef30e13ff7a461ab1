Real Madrid forward, Eden Hazard, has come under heavy criticism over his team’s exit from Champions League at the hands of Lyon. Former Chelsea striker, Tony Cascarino, slammed Hazard and accused him of failing to take his big-money transfer from the Blues to Real Madrid seriously. Hazard ended his eight-year trophy-laden stint at Chelsea last summer when the Los Blancos agreed to pay £90million for his services. “We all know how brilliant Hazard can be, we all know the difference he can make to a football team,” Cascarino told talkSPORT. “But he did not take the move to Madrid seriously, and he has paid for it this season. “He turned up overweight, he has been playing catch-up, he is getting niggly injuries. “Watching him last night was like watching a completely different player. “Kyle Walker must have been thinking, ‘Is this the same player I faced at Chelsea? “He is a brilliant player, but he has paid the price for turning up at Madrid for a big fee and not taking it seriously. “He does switch off every now and again. As good and as great as he can be, he does down tools every so often.”

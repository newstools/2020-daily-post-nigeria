The former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has claimed he fought off godfathers to ensure Governor Godwin Obaseki’s emergence in Edo State. Oshiomhole stated this on Monday, while speaking with state house correspondents after a meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari in Aso Rock, Abuja. “There is no village I go to that people do not know me. “It is this that I used to override the godfathers in Edo State for two consecutive terms and even got the governor elected through elections,” he said. Obaseki has previously claimed Oshiomhole had no money when he contested to become Edo state governor in 2007. Oshiomhole, who was a former president of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), contested under the Action Congress (AC) and lost to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Oserheimen Osunbor. However, he challenged the outcome of the election in court and was declared winner a year later.

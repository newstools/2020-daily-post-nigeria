Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Erica has said that she is Laycon’s source of fame in the house. Erica disclosed this during a conversation with Kiddwaya on Monday. According to the actress, the only question Ebuka often asked Laycon is about their failed relationship. She said, ”I am not even going to utter a word to him again, I notice every time Ebuka asks him a question it is always about Erica. He always asks other people different things but Laycon’s question is about me. ”I won’t allow him use me for fame again.” She added. Recall that Laycon and Erica clashed on Sunday after the host of the show, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, quizzed Laycon about claims that Erica tried to kiss him severally. In response, he said that it happened when Erica was intoxicated. After Ebuka’s interrogation, Erica immediately confronted Laycon about his remarks.

Big Brother Naija housemate, Kiddwaya, has given reasons for avoiding Nengi intentionally in the house. Nengi approached Kiddwaya after Saturday night party, accusing him of avoiding her. According to her, they are close friends and should talk to each other often. This was after the bathroom moment which got Ozo jealous. Kiddwaya, responding said he avoided Nengi not because of any personal reason but he got bored with her. “Let me be honest with you, I got bored of you. Everyone has their time. “It’s nothing personal, trust me.” The conversation between both housemates eventually got Erica upset last night as she complained of how close Nengi was to Kiddwaya. Erica seems not to be letting go of the Benue-born housemate despite the breakup on Friday and Kiddwaya is bent on the fact that he just wants to be close friends and not relationship.

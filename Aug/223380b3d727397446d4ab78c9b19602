Renowned English sports journalist, Piers Morgan, has blasted Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire, for displaying a shocking lack of leadership following his arrest on the Greek island of Mykonos. DAILY POST had reported that Maguire was arrested and detained for questioning in the Greek Island of Mykonos on Thursday, for allegedly assaulting officers after a brawl. The 27-year-old defender made an appearance in court on Saturday and will face trial next week amid allegations of assaulting police officers and bribery. Reacting to the development, Morgan, in a tweet via his official Twitter handle on Saturday said the England international has been arrested for drunkenly brawling with police officers more times than he has won a trophy at Man United. “Manchester United captain has been arrested for drunkenly brawling with police officers more times than he’s won a trophy since being with the club,” Morgan tweeted. “Admire Harry Maguire as a player, but this is shockingly poor leadership. “Especially during a pandemic.”

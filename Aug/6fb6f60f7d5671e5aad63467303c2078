Big Brother has given the new head of house, Kiddwaya a new secret task. In the new task, Biggieâ€™s voice will not be heard in the house for a few days as he will embark on a vacation. Biggie instructed Kiddwaya to keep this as a secret and not to tell housemates about his absence. He promised Kiddwaya a gift if he makes this secret without explaining to the housemates. He would henceforth communicate with only Kiddwaya via a telephone call. This is the first time Big Brother will not be heard in the house for days.

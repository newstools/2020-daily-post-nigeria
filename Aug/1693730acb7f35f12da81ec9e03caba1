Kolade Balogun, a convicted internet fraudster, is to control traffic for three months. He is also to pay a fine of N50,000. Justice Sikiru Oyinloye of a Kwara State High Court, sitting in Ilorin, convicted Balogun, following his arraignment by the Ilorin Zonal office of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. According to the charge sheet brought against the convict by the anti-graft agency, “Kolade Balogun, (a.k.a William Davis, alias Bahemooth) sometimes in March 2020, or thereabout, at Ilorin, Kwara state within the jurisdiction of this honourable court, attempted to commit an offence of cheating by personation by pretending and representing yourself to be a Whiteman called William Davis, alias Bahemooth to unsuspected white woman on dating site called seeking arrangement as it is contained in your Gmail account, williamdavis@gmail.com and thereby committed an offence contrary to and punishable under Section 95 of the Penal code of Northern Nigeria.” Balogun pleaded guilty when the charge sheet was read to him. Prosecuting counsel, Aliyu Adebayo, in his submission, asked the court to convict the defendant based on his plea, proof of evidence, and exhibits tendered. But defence counsel, Rotimi Oyagbola, urged the trial judge to temper justice with mercy, arguing that his client was a first offender. In his judgement, Justice Oyinloye, said the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, considering the unchallenged and uncontradicted testimonies of the prosecution witness. The judge said the convict should pay a fine of N50,000 and also control traffic at the junction behind the state Ministry of Physical Planning for three months, commencing from August 17 to October 17, 2020. He further ordered that his items like phones and laptops recovered from him be forfeited to the Federal Government of Nigeria.

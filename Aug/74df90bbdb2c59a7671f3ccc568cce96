Former Nigeria president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has called on younger Africans to participate actively in politics and force out the older generation. Obasanjo stated this while delivering a keynote address at a virtual interactive session, held to mark this year’s International Youth Day, organized by the Youth Development Centre, an arm of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) in Abeokuta, Ogun State. It had participants from Nigeria, Mali, USA, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa in attendance. According to Obasanjo, unless the leaders are forced out, they would continue to occupy the political offices. “Unless you squeeze out those who are in the office and those who want to remain in office perpetually, some after the age of 80. “Unless you squeeze them out they will not want to be out,” he said. Obasanjo also said that for youths to influence the political structure, they have to start at the party level.

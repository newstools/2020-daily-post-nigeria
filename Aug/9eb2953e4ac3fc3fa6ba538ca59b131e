The University of Lagos (UNILAG) Senate and four unions have opposed the removal of Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe as Vice Chancellor. They labeled the sack and the appointment of Prof. Theophilus Soyombo as Acting VC, illegal. On Thursday, Ogundipe and Prof. Folashade Ogunsola, Deputy VC (Development Services) met the joint congress of the staff unions amid cheers. The Senate and unions marched in protest round UNILAG premises. The unions and their leaders signed a resolution against Ogundipe’s removal. They are Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) – Dele Ashiru; Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU) – Olusola Sowunmi; Non Academic Staff Union (NASU) – Ajibade Kehinde; and National Association Academics of Technologies (NAAT). Former Dean, Faculty of Law, Prof. Chioma Agomo, announced that the Senate had passed vote of confidence on Ogundipe. She stressed that the Senate “does not recognise anybody as acting VC”, and has lost confidence in the governing council. “We call on President Muhammadu Buhari to dissolve the (Wale) Babalakin-led governing council. The Senate will not accept any surrogate acting VC. The governing council sidelined the Senate,” she said. She explained that according to the law, a joint Council and Senate committee should have been constituted to investigate the allegations against Ogundipe. The Babalakin-led council had convened an emergency council where it removed Ogundipe, based on the Saminu Dagari report. But Agomo said it was sad that “after working here (UNILAG) for 30 years, council will take a decision without Senate’s inputs. His removal did not follow due process.” Ogundipe, in his remarks, expressed excitement at the open solidarity. He vowed to forever remain a loyal union member. “I am okay and sound. We should be joyful no matter what has happened”, Ogundipe added.

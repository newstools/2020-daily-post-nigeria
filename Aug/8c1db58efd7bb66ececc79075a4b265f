Social media influencer, Adedamola Adewale, AKA “Adeherself” has narrated her ordeal at
the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) custody. Adeherself, who was arraigned on a one-count charge of possession of fraudulent documents, was arrested following intelligence received on the activities of some alleged internet fraudsters in Lekki, Lagos. She was released after meeting her bail conditions. Speaking on her ordeal at the EFCC custody, Adeherself in a video on her Instagram page, said the incident had left her depressed. She stated that although her parents and Manager got her a therapist from the US, life has not been the same. Adeherself explained that she’s trying hard to come out of depression and is unable to make more skits because the energy isn’t there anymore. “I just want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out to me, asking when I will drop my next skit. I have been trying my best not to fall into depression. I have been going through counselling and it has not been easy. “44 days in cell was no joke, I will not wish such on an enemy. “The pressure is everywhere and the whole thing is not easy. The energy is not the same, my parents and Manager are really trying. I really appreciate everyone.” She said.

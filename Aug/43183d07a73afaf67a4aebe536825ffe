The All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the forthcoming Edo State governorship election, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has said he does not want to go to jail. Ize-Iyamu stated this on Friday, while speaking with State House correspondents, following his endorsement by President Muhammadu Buhari. He vehemently distanced himself from the uprising happening in the state ahead of the polls. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) also threatened to halt the governorship election in the state if violence persists. But responding to a question on violence in the state, Ize-Iyamu blamed Obaseki, who he claimed had threatened to deal with anybody due to the immunity he enjoys. “If you ask your correspondents in Edo, it is the governor that has been beating the war drums. My billboards are being vandalised, nobody has touched their own. “We wrote petitions to the Commissioner of Police, the Director DSS. They are the ones that want to make the state ungovernable. I am sure you heard the governor say that himself and his deputy have immunity and so they can deal with anybody. “I don’t have immunity, I don’t want to go to jail and it is not in my character to deal with anyone.”

An Igbosere High Court in Lagos State, on Tuesday, remanded a truck driver, Sodiq Okanlanwan, alongside the truck owner, Wadiu Lekan, over alleged crushing of three people to death. NAN reports that the duo were charged on three counts by the Lagos State Government. The state Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Moyosore Onigbanjo (SAN), alleged that the defendants committed the offences on July 26, at 4:00p.m., at Ilasamaja. Onigbanjo said the defendants unlawfully killed Nnaekpe Chima Victor, Chidinma Ajoku, a FAAN staff and Daniel Okwuoge by running over them with their truck. The Attorney-General also prayed that the court should remand them in police custody pending when they would be tested for COVID-19 before they could be remanded at the appropriate correctional facility. Onigbanjo asked for a short adjournment for commencement of trial. However, the defendants pleaded not guilty to the allegations against them. Delivering Judgement, Justice Mobolanle Okikiolu-Ighile ordered thatâ€™s they be remanded for alleged involuntary manslaughter. The Justice adjourned the case until Aug. 20 for trial.

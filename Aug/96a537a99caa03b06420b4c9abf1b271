The Lagos State Film and Video Censors Board (LSFVCB) has announced a one-month ultimatum to content producers. Executive Secretary, Bamidele Balogun, spoke while unveiling a Performing Musicians Employers Association (PMAN) project on revenue generation for entertainers. He advised practitioners involved in production, sale, distribution of audio and visual products “to register through the board’s authorized agent within 30 days.” “Henceforth, all audio and visual contents produced and sold within Lagos State shall attract the payment of five percent levy on each item”, Balogun declared. The official warned that violators of the registration would face severe sanctions. The board appealed to stakeholders in the entertainment sector to comply with its directive. Meanwhile, the Lagos government regulations for ride-hailing companies like Bolt and Uber will be effective August 20.

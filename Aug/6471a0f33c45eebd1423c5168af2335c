The sack of Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), is not going well with some council members. On Wednesday, Oladejo Azeez, UNILAG Registrar and Secretary to the Governing Council, made the announcement. The governing council is chaired by Wale Babalakin. Two members, who are UNILAG Senate representatives, have openly opposed the decision. In separate reactions, they accused the council chairman of persecuting Ogundipe. Prof. Olukemi Odukoya noted that Babalakin has had is way in actualising his machinery to remove the VC. “At today’s 12th August 2020, Emergency Meeting of Council in Abuja, Dr. Babalakin asked the VC and DVC (DS) to leave the meeting and by vote of 6 to 4, announced that the Vice-Chancellor has been removed.” Odukoya urged members to arise, adding that “we must defend the management of the university.” Similarly, another Senate Rep. Prof. Bola Oboh, stated that UNILAG regulation has been stepped on and ridiculed. He said Babalakin waited for the tenure of Prof. Chukwu and Prof. Familoni to end and convened an emergency council meeting based on the Saminu Dagari report. Oboh accused Babalakin of not allowing Ogundipe defend himself before calling for a vote. “I, (Prof. Oboh), Prof. Odukoya, Prof. Leshi and John Momoh voted against the removal of the VC. Six persons (excluding Babalakin) voted for. Babalakin then went ahead to announce the removal of the VC. Dear Senate members, the procedure for removal of persons in office is clear and this was pointed out to Babalakin several times but he turned deaf ears. Please let us arise to fight this.” Meanwhile, the management has dismissed the sack. The rejoinder was personally signed by the embattled VC, Ogundipe.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has named a 30-man squad for Wednesday’s Europa League home game against LASK. Phil Jones makes the cut, despite being sidelined since the restart. However, Luke Shaw and Axel Tuanzebe are left out after suffering long term injuries. Youth-team skipper, Teden Mengi is on the list, along with fellow defender, Ethan Laird, who has already made two appearances in the competition this season.

The Emir of Anka who doubles as the chairman, Zamfara State council of chiefs, Alhaji Attahiru Ahmad Muhammad has urged policymakers both at the local, states and federal levels to formulate policies that will promote youths development, empowerment and general well-being of young people, so as to reduce insecurity in the country. The Emir gave the advice during a chat with newsmen in Gusau, Zamfara State Sunday. He further called on the policymakers to come up with policies and programs that will protect the rights of women and children, pointing out that such policies were imperative because of the need to educate women on their rights. He explained that most women in the North were ignorant of the rights of their co-wives in polygamous families, explaining that it is Islam that gives the man the right to marry more than one wife and mandated him to head his family in order to ensure that justice and equity prevail among them and their children. “Some of the women are being maltreated and to some extent, barbaric punishments are often meted on the children of the co-wives in cases of divorce, deaths and other reasons. “To achieve this, the forum of scholars and knowledgeable citizens should be created with a mandate to meet every year and come out with a solution to address youths, women and children’s welfare. “This will go a long way also in uniting wives with their in-laws and address cases where the wives discourage their husbands in assisting his relatives which creates a lot of vacuums,” he said The forum according to him could publish a book that could be either in volume or be updated every year and be accessible to all.

Evicted Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, Praise has debunked claims by fellow housemate Ezekiel Bright Osemudiame, AKA Brighto, that he is set to marry a woman of over sixty years. Recall that Brighto had in a conversation with Kiddwaya, said that the woman Praise always brags about is “sixty-something years old.” Brighto, a 29-year-old housemate, told Kiddwaya, “What I want to do now is, whenever he says anything, I’ll tackle him. I know his weak point. But, reacting during his media rounds, Praise on Wednesday said he was not married and his wife to be is 42 years and not 60-years- old as alleged by Brighto. He further stated that his fiancée’s age is not a problem for him. When asked if he was married, the 28-year-old father of one said, I am engaged. I feel like it is Brighto’s opinion. “I remember having a conversation where Lucy mentioned to the whole house that she cannot be in a relationship with a guy that is younger than her so I had to set her straight like look, relationships are really not about age. “My girl is older than me, she is way older than me but then we get the same respect and we respect each other the same way. “ I don’t ever feel like age is ever a problem with us. She is 42 years old actually.”

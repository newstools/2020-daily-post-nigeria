An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos, on Tuesday, ordered that one Ismail Ganiu, 42, who allegedly defiled his neighbour’s 16-year-old daughter be remanded in prison. The defendant, who resides at Ikotun area of Lagos, is being tried for alleged sexual assault. The Prosecutor, ASP Bisi Ogunleye, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Aug. 11 at his residence. He said that the defendant sexually assaulted the girl by penetrating through her vagina. “The suspect called the girl into his apartment with pretext of sending her on errands, but immediately she entered, he bolted the door, pushed her on his bed and forcefully removed her clothes. “The teenager struggled and tried to shout for help, but the defendant covered her mouth with cloth and forcefully had sexual intercourse with her. “After he was through with her, the girl rushed out of his room and raised alarm, and the defendant was apprehended and handed over to the police,” Ogunleye told the court. The sexual penetration violates Section 263 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, and is punishable with up to life imprisonment. In ruling, Magistrate, Mrs E. Kubeinje, who did not take the defendant’s plea, ordered the police to send the case file to the state Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for advice. She, therefore, ordered that the defendant be kept in Kirikiri Correctional Centre, pending the DPP’s advice. Magistrate Kubeinje then adjourned the case until Sept. 9 for mention, NAN reports.

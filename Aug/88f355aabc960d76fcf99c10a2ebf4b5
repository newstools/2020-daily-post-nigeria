Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has urged security operatives to check the activities of Miyetti Allah groups in the state. Ortom said security agents should ensure that members of Miyetti Allah are apprehended and made to face the wrath of the law for their crimes against people of the state. He gave the call while insisting that his administration won’t repel the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law in the state. A statement by his spokesman, Tever Akase on Monday said the Open Grazing law would prevent herdsmen from taking over the ancestral land of people of the state. The statement reads partly: “Miyetti Allah and their conspirators are hereby told for the umpteenth time, that Benue State will NOT repeal the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law to pave way for Fulani herdsmen to take over the people’s ancestral lands for cattle grazing. “The Law has not only come to stay; it is fully being enforced. The Ranching Law has been well accepted by the people of Benue State and no intimidation or arm-twisting tactics from the named groups can change it. “Governor Ortom urges security forces once again to check activities of Miyetti Allah groups who have sworn on several occasions to foist violence on Benue, and bring their members to justice for their crimes against the people of the state.”

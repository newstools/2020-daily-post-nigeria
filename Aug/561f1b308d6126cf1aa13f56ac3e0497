He said: ”Firstly, let me offer thanks to God that the much-awaited examination for this year has finally commenced today. ”As I speak, this examination is going on simultaneously across all member states in the region. ”As you already know we have visited a couple of schools in the state on this first day of the examination and I will like to say I am highly impressed with what I saw on the ground in terms of compliance level by everyone participating in this examination. ”We all observe the rules by washing our hands with soap and water, carrying out temperature checks, use of hand sanitisers and face masks or shields. ”Even the sitting arrangement of the candidates are very well established by ensuring a two-meter gap from each other. ”So, if you ask me, I will say I am very impressed with the level of compliance of the COVID-19 safety protocol and the smooth take-off of the examination,” the HNO said.

Chile striker, Alexis Sánchez, has finally spoken, since his £500,000-a-week contract with Manchester United was terminated by mutual consent on Wednesday. Man United agreed to pay Sanchez off, in order to encourage him to leave the club and join Inter Milan on a permanent basis. Both clubs announced the transfer on Thursday. Reacting to the development, Sanchez said he feels at home at Inter Milan and is happy to have completed a permanent transfer from Man United. “I am really happy to be staying here with you, Inter fans,” Sanchez told Inter Milan’s social media channels. “I have found a family here, and the staff are great. “[It’s] a group where there is a real desire to win something big. People here want to fight together as a team to give the club the success it deserves. “I am hungry, and I want to win – my goal is to make all our fans happy. I am here to win, and I am happy that I am staying here at Inter!”

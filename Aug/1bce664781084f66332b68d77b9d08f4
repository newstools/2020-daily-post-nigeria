Big Brother Naija lockdown housemate, Kiddwaya, has confirmed his breakup with Erica to his friend, Brighto. DAILY POST reported earlier that Kiddwaya ended his relationship with Erica after she complained of lack of respect and regards from the Billionaire’s son. Recall that during one of their conversations last night, Kiddwaya had told Erica that he may not have time for her outside the reality TV show. He suggested that their relationship will be based on trust which Erica, unfortunately, said she doesn’t have for him. And on Friday afternoon, Kiddwaya decided to call it quits since according to him, he does not meet her emotional desires. Brifgto started the conversation by saying, “You just lock up. You and your madam,” (speaking in pidgin English) And Kiddwaya responded, “I told her we should be friends. Just friends. I am serious. I told her.”

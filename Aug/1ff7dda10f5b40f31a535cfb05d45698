Though, the law doesn’t permit ages 0 -17 to buy landed properties, but T Pumpy said this is legally achievable through parents and guardians. Mr. Adaralegbe made this disclosure during a recent interview with Wazobia FM in Abuja. He said some of subscribers would enjoy reasonable discount on the land which has Certificate of Occupancy. “We will make the big announcement and reveal more details on September 1, 2020,” he said. <img class="size-full wp-image-829219 aligncenter" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG-20200815-WA0009-1.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="360" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG-20200815-WA0009-1.jpg 360w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG-20200815-WA0009-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG-20200815-WA0009-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG-20200815-WA0009-1-80x80.jpg 80w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG-20200815-WA0009-1-45x45.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"> This is coming barely one month after the company, which has estates spread across Lugbe, Guzape, Karasana, kyami, Life Camp, Jabi, Wawa and Kuje announced 50 per cent discount for its lands.

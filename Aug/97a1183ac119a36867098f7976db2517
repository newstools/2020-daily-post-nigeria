Big Brother Naija housemate, K3ana, has given reasons other housemates voted her out on Sunday. Ka3na became the first contestant to leave the show this year. When interviewed by host Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, she said she had “mixed feelings’ about leaving so early. However, she was not angry with other housemates for voting her out as “it is only a game at the end of the day.” Ka3na said she came on the show to sell her name and brand. “I will continue working on my brand. I am grateful for this platform,” she added.

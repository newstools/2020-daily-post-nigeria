The Ogun State government has reacted to the death of a motor boy, who was reported to have fallen off a truck being chased by operatives of the Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps on Tuesday. DAILY POST reported that the death of the motor boy had triggered a violent protest, as truck drivers invaded the office of the traffic agency in Ibara Housing Estate, Abeokuta, vandalising vehicles and other items. In a statement made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, the government said it “regrets the unfortunate loss of life of the truck ‘motor boy’ allegedly caused by actions of truck drivers and the officials of Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Agency (TRACE).” A statement signed by the Ogun State Commissioner for Transportation, Gbenga Dairo, said the government commiserates with the family of the deceased over the incident; assuring that every step would be taken to avoid a recurrence. Dairo maintained that the state government has directed the State Police Command to investigate the incident, to unravel the circumstances that led to it. According to him, the affected TRACE Patrol Team, are already being subjected to administrative trial. “The public should further note that the Ogun State Government remains committed to ensuring the safety of lives and properties of all residents and visitors in the State in all locations they find themselves including the roads. “Government, however, wishes to remind all that destruction of public utilities as a way of protest does no one no good, and, therefore, condemns, in strong terms, the wanton destruction of government facilities at the TRACE office in Ibara, which was put in place with taxpayers money. “As a result, we wish to enjoin Trade Unions to desist from taking laws into their hands under any guise, but rather explore laid down legal avenues of registering grievances towards any development,” Dairo posited

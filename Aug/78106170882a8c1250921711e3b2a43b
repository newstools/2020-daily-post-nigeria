Borussia Dortmund CEO, Hans-Joachim Watzke, has admitted the club would be unable to make signings, but insists Jadon Sancho will not join Manchester United this summer. The Bundesliga club have been hit hard by the economic impact of COVID-19, but Watzke said the club are confident Sancho will stay for the 2020/2021 campaign. On Monday, Dortmund are set to announce losses of over €40m for last term and Watzke told dpa: “It’s a fact that there is no more money left for transfer fee.” “If you lose €4m for every match played without fans, and we do that, you must not be a prophet to calculate which direction it’s headed. We definitely can’t make any more big leaps. “Sancho staying at BVB is set in stone. We will not discuss the details. But what I can emphasis: If Michael Zorc, who is a Westphalian just like me, talks about a definite decision, then it’s definite. There is no room for interpretation.” Sancho is United’s number one transfer target this summer, but they failed to meet an August 10 deadline to make a €120 million bid for the 20-year-old before he joined up with Dortmund’s preseason squad in Switzerland.

Former Arsenal midfielder, Santi Cazorla has congratulated the Gunners for winning this year’s FA Cup final. Arsenal beat London rivals Chelsea 2-1 at an empty Wembley Stadium on Saturday to lift the FA Cup. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was the star of the show with two goals, cancelling out Christian Pulisic’s opener for Frank Lampard’s side. Cazorla took to their official Instagram handle on Sunday, to hail Arsenal’s achievement. “Well done boys, one more for all of you,” Cazorla posted alongside a picture of Arsenal squad including the club coaches celebrating. Cazorla and Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta were former teammates at Arsenal. The 35-year-old played his last game for Villarreal last month.

Arsenal have confirmed the appointment of three new members to head coach Mikel Arteta’s backroom team. The Gunners have quickly moved to replace Freddie Ljungberg, who stepped down from his role as first-team coach this week to pursue his management ambitions. Goalkeeping coach, Sal Bibbo, has also left the club after five years. Former Juventus coach, Carlos Cuesta, is one of the new faces at the Emirates, as well as Andreas Georgson from Brentford and Miguel Molina who has previously worked for Atletico Madrid. Jordan Reece has also been promoted to head physio, following Chris Morgan’s move back to Liverpool. Arsenal legend, Dennis Bergkamp, had been linked with a return, but Arteta has ultimately gone with his own selections.

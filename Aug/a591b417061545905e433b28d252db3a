Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said he does not care about what people would say about him when he dies. Obasanjo was responding to the verbal attacks he received from some Nigerians following his reaction to the death of Senator Buruji Kashamu. The 83-year-old politician wondered why bad people should be eulogised when they pass on. Obasanjo said he grew up in a community that does not eulogise or sing praises for people known with bad character when they were alive. Obasanjo had reacted to the death of Kashamu, saying that despite using politics to maneuver the law to escape justice, Kashamu could not escape death. His comment caused anger among some Nigerians with the immediate past Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, saying that Nigerians will watch out for the end of Obasanjo, warning the former President against acting like a saint. Responding, the former President said, “As you know, I say my mind as truthfully as I know them and in line with my convictions,” as quoted by Premium Times. “People are free to say whatever they want about my comment. I don’t begrudge people for holding opinions on whatever I say or do. “Let people say whatever they like when I transit. Now that I am alive, am I not being abused? “Whenever I transit, let people say whatever they know or think about me. Let them say it as it is. What my maker thinks of me is what matters most.”

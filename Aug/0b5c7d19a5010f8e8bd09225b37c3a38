The All Progressives Congress (APC) has reacted to comments by the National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Uche Secondus, against President Muhammadu Buhari. Secondus had attacked Buhari for saying he did not militarize the 2019 election like previous governments. APC declared that the PDP is in willful denial of the obvious that under Buhari, “free, fair and credible elections is the new normal.” Yekini Nabena, APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, in a statement on Monday, said rather than condemnation, Secondus should wail for his party. He noted that the PDP has seen stalwarts detach from it, “as witnessed during the Party’s 2019 presidential campaigns and the Bayelsa State Governorship bribe-for-ticket scandal that indicted Secondus.” “Little wonder, the recent months have witnessed many PDP members resign their membership due to Secondus’s activities which have brought the PDP to its knees.” Nabena stressed that voting power is fast returning to the people and the era of stolen and procured votes is fast-fading. He reiterated that Buhari’s declaration that the APC could have used the military and other security services to overrun opposition states but chose not to; demonstrates the party’s proven democratic and progressive credentials.’ “Why will the PDP under Secondus not support efforts to ensure the independence of our state institutions such as the Judiciary, INEC and our security services and ultimately deepen our democracy and improve our electioneering system?” APC called on progressive partisans, particularly in the PDP, not to sink with the opposition party “which has become clearly disillusioned under Secondus.”

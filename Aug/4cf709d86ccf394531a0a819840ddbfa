Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has warned their Champions League rivals, that they will be difficult to beat. The Ligue 1 giants qualified for the semi-final on Wednesday, thanks to a last-gasp 2-1 win over Atalanta. Mario Pasalic’s goal put the Serie A side in front and they led for most of the game. However, Marquinhos netted a late equalizer, before Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting tapped in the winner in stoppage time. PSG will now face either RB Leipzig or Atletico Madrid in the last four on August 18. “It’s a great night. We knew they were aggressive, they had chances, they played a good game. We have a great game too. “We are now going to rest because it is a game that has fatigued a lot mentally. “We never thought about going home. From start to finish, as soon as we warmed up, we thought about qualifying in the semi-final and no one will take my mind off that we want to be in the final. The first step is over.” PSG are on course to face any of Manchester City, Barcelona or Bayern Munich in the final.

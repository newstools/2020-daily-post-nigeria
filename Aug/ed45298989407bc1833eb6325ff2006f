The Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI), which is led by the Sultan of Sokoto, Mohammed Sa’ad Abubakar III, has warned Southern Kaduna leaders against making inflammatory comments. The JNI in a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Khalid Aliyu, said such remarks would aggravate the crisis in the area. The group also said it strongly believed that the politically-driven crisis was being deliberately turned into ethno-religious conflict of worrisome dimension. The statement read in part: “The Jama’atu Nasril Islam, JNI, under the leadership of Alhaji Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto and its President-General, observed carefully with serious concern the unfortunate unfolding events of blood-letting and serial killings, as well as the resultant inflammatory commentaries being aired which are utterly condemnable in their entirety. “We strongly believe that the politically-driven crisis is being deliberately turned into ethno-religious conflict of worrisome dimension. Thus, we call for caution and restraint from all parties involved. “It should however, be noted that ethno-religious conflict isn’t easily manageable, hence, we must all rise to the occasion to forestall its recurrence in Kaduna state, as it is often said, a stitch in time saves nine!”

The relationship between BBNaija housemates, Prince and Tolanibaj, has crashed within a short time. Prince and Tolanibaj became lovers weeks ago after Prince chose her over Nengi and Wathoni who he also had feelings for. However, the relationship had not been steady as Tolanibaj has complained severally about Prince not openly showing his feelings for her. On Thursday, she finally approached Prince and ended the relationship. According to her, she is not happy being with him and just wants them to be friends. She said, “Prince, I want us to just be friends. “We can try things later and see how it works out but for now, it’s not working. I’m sorry.” Prince on his part, accepted the break up and expressed hope for a better relationship outside the house.

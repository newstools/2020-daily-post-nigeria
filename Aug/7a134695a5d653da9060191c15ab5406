Former senator who represented Imo East senatorial district, Samuel Anyanwu, has called on the federal government to dialogue with secessionist group, Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) instead of using military to molest and victimize the group. Anyanwu who condemned in strong words, the recent attack on members of IPOB in Enugu State which left many dead, wondered why the FG could absorb repented members of a terrorist group like Boko Haram and continues to treat the nonviolent Biafra group with disdain. The former Imo House of Assembly lawmaker further said that the ugly trend would have been nipped in the bud if the federal government had sought for a truce with the secessionist group. According to a release signed by his media aid, Ikenna Onuoha, “IPOB members are made of the Igbos whose activities are devoid of rancour, violence and acrimony. I wonder why the security agents who are expected to protect the masses could carelessly engage the people with live bullets leading to waste of lives and property. “The attack on innocent members of the IPOB by the security agents which led to several losses of lives is condemnable.” He advised the Federal Government to desist from the use of force in a purely civil matter which should have been resolved amicably. In the same vein, he called on the Inspector General of Police to bring anyone connected to the ugly incident to book while appealing to members of IPOB to operate within the ambit of the law as contained in the 1999 constitution. He said further killings will be forestalled if the FG would adhere to his advice. It will be recalled that some security agents last week in Enugu State attacked unarmed members of IPOB and left many dead during a peaceful demonstration.

The Ojirua of Irrua, HRH Williams Okuagban Momodu II, has endorsed All Progressives Congress (APC) Edo governorship candidate, Osagie Ize-Iyamu. The traditional ruler received Ize-Iyamu in his palace on Tuesday. He addressed him as ‘the next Governor of Edo State’. “I welcome you, my Governor. Your visit here is to further familiarize yourself with our people and have already been chosen. I watched on television as the President handed over the party’s flag to you. I wasn’t there but what I did in my room was to clap my hands.” “This is our son, he is going to be the next Governor. I am the owner of Esan land. I will be celebrating 50 years on the throne next June, I am sure this Governor, Pastor Ize-Iyamu, is going to be my chairman.” The monarch, however, condemned the invasion and vandalization of the Edo State House of Assembly complex last week. Ojirua described the incident as sad, noting that government resources would be spent on repairs. In his remarks, Ize-Iyamu expressed gratitude to the people of Irrua for their acceptance. He promised to run an administration respectful of traditional institutions and partner with all rulers to address the security challenge of Edo. Ize-Iyamu and Governor Godwin Obaseki will go head to head on September 19. Obaseki is the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). On Monday, the Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Opeyemi Bamidele, accused him of unlawful acts against the legislature. The Ekiti federal lawmaker declared that Obaseki was engaging in illegality due to the “desperation to secure a second term.” He warned the governor not to allow his ambition to desecrate, destroy and subvert the legislative institution in Edo State.

The National Consultative Front, NCF, the newly formed political group, has lamented the rate of insecurity in Nigeria. NCF said Nigeria may end up like Somalia with the current widespread violence, insurgency, banditry, and crime in the country. This was disclosed by NCF leaders, Prof. Pat Utomi and Ghali Na’Abba in a statement they jointly signed and issued on Monday. They also lamented the economic situation of the country which they said have kept Nigerians in “perpetual recursive mode.” According to NCF: “I have pointed to the widespread violence, insurgency, banditry, and crime that is pointing us on the road to Somalia, the crisis in our educational system, and the economic troubles that keep our wellbeing in perpetual recursive mode. “Everyone knows that without peace, progress is a pipe dream, yet we continue to mismanage the violence that is now Nigeria writ large. “My first point about the violence engulfing us today is that it is so without purpose. We seem all so vulnerable to nihilists. “Poverty and policy failure regarding education and economic growth are critical to reversing the situation. But I do not see effective deployment of soft power in dealing with the issues.”

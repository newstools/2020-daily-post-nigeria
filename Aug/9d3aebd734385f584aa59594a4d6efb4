The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, NAFDAC, has cautioned Nigerians to stop the consumption of organic apple and black currant originating from Australia. NAM reports that NAFDAC Director-General, Prof. Moji Adeyeye, who disclosed this to newsmen on Tuesday said the products had been certified harmful for human consumption. “The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of Hong Kong’s Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has warned against the consumption of Pure Tassie Organic Apple and Blackcurrant Juice originating from Australia. “This was due to unacceptable level of patulin (a mycotoxin) which had exceeded the maximum limit in fruit juice,” Adeyeye said. She further explained that the level of patulin content in the affected fruit juice can induce liver, spleen and kidney damage. According to her, the toxic level would affect immune system and cause nausea, gastrointestinal disturbance and vomiting. She also said that the name of the product is Pure Tassie, an organic apple and blackcurrant juice from Australia. The NAFDAC boss urged healthcare professionals and consumers to report adverse or side effects related to the use of this product to the nearest NAFDAC office through NAFDAC PRASCOR (20543 TOLL FREE) for all networks.
“We implore importers, distributors, retailers and consumers to immediately stop the importation, distribution, sale and consumption of the affected fruit juice. “Also, we call on members of the public who are in possession of the affected fruit juice to submit stock to the nearest NAFDAC office. “ However, the agency could be reached through pharmacovigilance@nafdac.gov.ng or via the NAFDAC ADR e-Reporting platform available at www.nafdac.gov.ng if any issue is to reported,” she added.

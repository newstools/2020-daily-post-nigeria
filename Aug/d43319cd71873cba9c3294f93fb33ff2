The Jama’atu Nasril Islam (JNI) on Wednesday revealed why there is consistent crisis in Southern Kaduna In a statement signed by the Secretary-General, Dr. Khalid Abubakar Aliyu, JNI said that, unguarded utterances of some citizens including elder statesmen, whom it believed were making economic fortunes out of the Southern Kaduna crisis, were making peace difficult in the region. The apex Islamic body in the North further said in the statement that, both the federal and state governments should act fast to ensure that such groups do not jeopardise the already fragile situation, but step-up efforts to bring an end to the crises. “It is very clear that some interest groups cried wolf than the bereaved in the present circumstance and thus, the need for government to quickly act before such interest groups exacerbate the already precarious situation, that could jeopardize frantic efforts aimed at restoring law and order, through dialogue and commitment for peace, with all relevant stakeholders in the state,” the statement added

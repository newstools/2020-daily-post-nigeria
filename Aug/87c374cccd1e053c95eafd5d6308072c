The Arewa Youths Consultative Forum, AYCF, has reacted to insinuations of Bola Tinubu, a National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and Nasir El-Rufai, Governor of Kaduna State running for the office of the president and vice president of Nigeria in 2023. AYCF President-General, Yerima Shettima, said Nigerians would decide if Tinubu and El-Rufai are qualified to run for the presidency and vice in 2023. Speaking with DAILY POST, Shettima said Nigerians would consider their past antecedents and competence to determine if they qualify to occupy the highest political offices in the country. Though both Tinubu and El-Rufai have not declared their intention publicity, there are insinuations that the duo are working behind the scenes in their push for the position of president and vice, respectively. However, Shettima said: “Who has the right to stop Tinubu from coming out, is he not a Nigerian? However, citizens would decide whether he is qualified or not. Nobody has any right to stop anybody from coming out. “Nigerian will decide if Tinubu is qualified, is he that clean? What are his antecedents? Does he have the capacity? “Probably when the chips are down and the time comes we will be able to speak either for or against but he has not even come out to declare his intentions yet, so let him come out first we are waiting.” On claims that El-Rufai is eyeing the office of the vice president ahead of 2023, Shettima said: “Nigerians would have to decide that based on his past antecedents and how competent he is.”

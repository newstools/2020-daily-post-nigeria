United States First Lady, Melania Trump, on Tuesday expressed confidence that Americans will re-elect her husband, Donald Trump. On the second night of the Republican National Convention, she did not lash out at the Democrats or its candidate, Joe Biden, in her speech. Melania told an audience at the White House that she would not attack “the other side’’. In attendance were the President, Vice President, Mike Pence, and other senior administration officials. Melania described the American leader as an honest person, who says it as it is. “Almost four years ago, we went into Election Day completely underestimated. Despite what is being said again this year, I know just as you do that Americans will go to the polls, and will elect Trump on behalf of their families, our economy, our national security and our children’s future.” The First Lady also commented on the nationwide protests over racial injustice and the COVID-19 pandemic. Melania sympathized with people who have lost loved ones and those trying to pull through the economic impacts. “My husband’s administration will not stop fighting until there is an effective treatment or vaccine available to everyone. Donald will not rest until he has done all he can to take care of everyone impacted by this terrible pandemic.” “I urge people to come together in a civil manner, so we can work and live up to our standard American ideals. I also ask people to stop the violence and looting being done in the name of justice and never make assumptions based on the colour of a person’s skin.” On the opening night of the Democratic National Convention, Michelle Obama described the President as a leader deficient in empathy and experience. “If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it”, she told citizens. In his response, Trump said he would not be in power if Michelle’s husband and former President, Barack Obama performed well in office.

Femi Adesina, the Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media and Publicity has said that he is proud to be part of the current administration. According to Adesina, criticising Buhari and his government cannot erase the gains that have been made. The Presidential aide said this when he appeared on Channels Television’s Politics Today on Friday. “In a country of 200 million people, you will always have critics,” Adesina said. He said this does not change the fact that Buhari is at work and won’t stop to do what it has set out to achieve for the country. Adesina admitted that there are security challenges in the country, adding that “You can’t rejoice when you have a loss of lives and wanton destruction of properties. But it is relative to say it is worsening. We are not where we were.” “I am proud of this government,” he said. “I am proud that I am a partaker, that I am an insider. I believe that it is genuinely serving the country and to the best of its ability.” According to him, some people have chosen to play politics with criticising the administration, others have shown understanding. “In a democracy, you are responsible for the people,” he said. “But you have people who are playing politics with development, security, and loss of lives.”

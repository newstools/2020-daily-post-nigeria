Senate Chief Whip, Orji Uzor Kalu and Dr Stanley Uzochukwu of Stanel Group on Monday pay former Head of State, General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida (IBB) courtesy visit in Minna, Niger State. Uzochukwu, a key player in Nigerian youths development and jobs creation has strategically situated a branch of Stanel ‘One-Stop’ luxury centre housing 24/7 Stanel gas plant, Stanel Bakery, Stanel Chicken Republic brand and other products of Stanel brands serving the good people of Suleja and Minna at large. The Suleja branch of Stanel ‘One-Stop’ luxury facility has gainfully engaged many indigens of the state since its official commissioning by the state Governor, Abubakar Sani Bello on September 4, 2018. Furthering the relationship with the good people of Niger State, it could be recalled that Dr Stanley Uzochukwu on September 8, 2018 light up the street of Suleja as part of its social responsibility to the host Community. Similarly, Uzochukwu also, in the spirit of Nigerian unity, hosted Ramadan fast with Muslim faithfuls in Suleja on 29 May, 2019. Receiving the guests in his Minna residence, IBB excitedly told the Stanel Boss that he was interested in the younger generation like Dr Stanley Uzochukwu who are impressively adding values to the growth of Nigeria economy. In his word, “I am interested in identifying with younger generation of your kind. Keep up with the good work, my son.”

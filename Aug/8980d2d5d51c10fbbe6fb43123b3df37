Big Brother Naija, BBnaija 2020 housemate, Lucy has backtracked on her perception about Nengi. Lucy had earlier during her fight with Nengi blamed Ozo for always supporting and letting Nengi use him. However, she changed her mind during her diary session with Biggie on Thursday. According to her, Ozo is the one playing games and not Nengi. Lucy said: “Concerning this Dorathy, Nengi and Ozo case. I don’t think it is Nengi that is using people’s heads, I think Ozo is the one playing the game. Meanwhile, the friendship between Ozo and Dorathy seems to be falling apart as the female housemate has warned him to keep his distance from her.

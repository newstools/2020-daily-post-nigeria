The Kogi State People’s Democratic Party, PDP, has accepted the verdict of the Supreme Court which upheld the victory of Alhaji Yahaya Bello as Governor of Kogi State. The party also paid tribute to its flag bearer, Engr. Musa Wada and his running mate, Hon. Sam Aro. Reacting to Monday’s Supreme Court’s ruling, the PDP in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Bode Ogunmola, said while it accepts in good faith the ruling of the Apex Court, it leaves the final judgement in the hands of God. The statement said while the higher court in the land has given its verdict, the PDP has no choice than to accept it. The statement appreciated the resilience of members and the teeming supporters of the party. It also appreciated the legal team of the party and paid tribute to all those who either died, got maimed or injured during the election. Concluding, the party said, “We thank God for the grace and the courage to go this far. We believe that He has the ultimate say.” It could be recalled that the apex court on Monday disagreed with the appeal filed by the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Kogi Governorship Election, Musa Wada. Mr Wada had claimed that the election held on November 16, 2019, was riddled with serious electoral infractions; rigging and over-voting, and that Governor Bello didn’t secure the highest number of votes.

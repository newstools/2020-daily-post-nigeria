Big Brother Naija housemates, Vee and Nengi, on Monday night had a conversation about her relationship with Neo. Ozo and Nengi who became head and deputy head of house chose Vee and Neo to be their official guests to the HOH room for the week. Vee, during her visit on Monday night expressed her fear to Nengi about fame affecting her relationship with Neo outside the house. Nengi, responding advised her to take it one step at a time and just enjoy her relationship at the moment. She, however, feels that Neo loves Vee and would not want to lose her despite fame from the show. “I know fame changes people and you don’t know how you will act till you are there. “But I know Neo loves you. I see the way he looks at you, so I don’t think he would disappoint you,” Nengi told Vee. The 14 BBNaija housemates left in the house have five more weeks to battle for the grand prize of N85m.

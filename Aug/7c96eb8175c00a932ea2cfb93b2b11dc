Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemate Prince has advised his friend, Lucy on her attitude in the reality show. In the past few days, Lucy has engaged in heated arguments with Nengi and Erica. On Sunday night, she and Nengi hurled insults at each other after Nengi heard her muttering some words about her in the bathroom. Erica also insulted Lucy describing her as a clown who has issues with most housemates. Speaking to Lucy who almost got into a fight with Erica again on Wednesday, Prince said most of the housemates misunderstand Lucy because of how she puts out her emotions and acts defensively. He advised her to control her emotions and not let the emotions get in her way. Prince said: “Lucy you need to control your emotions, you feel everyone hates you and tries to be on the defensive. “You are an amazing person but we have different points of view and have different understandings so you cannot blame them. You cannot control how people act towards you. “You are my friend and you have flaws like every other person but never feel you are less of a person. “We all became agemates when we came here and are equals here. Do not let the bad in the world make you stop being good. That is who you are. “Not everyone will like you and we cannot all like each other. “When you say things sometimes and people do not understand it is because the person is stuck in what they believe in.” Lucy became emotional and broke down in tears saying most housemates misunderstand her and do not listen when she talks.

Former Arsenal and Chelsea left-back, Ashley Cole, has said Paris Saint-Germain’s front three of Kylian Mbappe, Neymar and Angel Di Maria, will be too hot for Bayern Munich to handle in the Champions League final. Both teams face each other in Lisbon on Sunday night. Cole, who won the Champions League with the Blues in 2012, told the Dream Screen that PSG’s rapid attackers will see the Ligue 1 champions come out tops. “The danger is behind and Neymar, Mbappe and Di Maria – I wouldn’t want to play against them, to be honest. “But I don’t know how interchangeable Bayern’s formation or personnel are. Will they change the formation or the way they play, the style they play? “They have to because they are coming up against a very good PSG side and a good front three with Di Maria, Mbappe and Neymar coming in between the lines,” Cole said. PSG thrashed RB Leipzig 3-0 in their semi-final clash, while Bayern also beat Lyon 3-0.

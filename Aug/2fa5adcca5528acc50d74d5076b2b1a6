Netflix star, Daisy Coleman has died at the age of 23, after eight years of emotional suffering from a rape incident. Her mother, Melinda confirmed the sad news in an interview with TMZ, adding that she cannot bear the loss.
“She was my best friend and amazing daughter. “I think she had to make it seem like I could live without her. “I can’t. I wish I could have taken the pain from her,” she said. According to Melinda, her daughter never recovered from the rape incident which happened when she was just 14 years at a house party in Missouri in 2012. “She never recovered from what those boys did to her and it’s just not fair. “It hurts so much to know that my baby girl is gone,” she added. Before her death, she was known for starring in the Netflix 2016 documentary ‘Audrie and Daisy’. Also, last year, her family suffered from the loss of her younger brother who was killed in a car accident.

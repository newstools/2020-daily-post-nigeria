Manchester United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has admitted he must make a “difficult” decision as he chooses who becomes first-choice goalkeeper next season. Solskjaer stuck with David de Gea last season, despite a string of high-profile errors. However, De Gea will have two top keepers pushing him next season. Argentina international Sergio Romero is regarded as the best back-up option in the Premier League and Dean Henderson will return from an impressive two seasons on loan at Sheffield United. “I think I must be the most privileged manager in the world with the goalkeeping department,” Solskhaer said ahead of United’s Europa League quarter-final tie with Copenhagen. “We’ll see what we’ll do going forward. Difficult? Yes. But that’s a good problem to have.” United’s current rotation system sees De Gea start Premier League matches and Romero feature in the cup competitions.

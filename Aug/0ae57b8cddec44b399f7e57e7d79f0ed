Willian has joined the ranks of the highest-paid players in the Premier League following his move to Arsenal. SportsMail reports that Willian has secured a massive payday with the Gunners. Arsenal has handed the 32-year-old a lucrative package worth up to £220,000 per week, to persuade him to cross the London divide. When bonuses, a signing-on fee and loyalty payments over the three years are included, it will amount to £220,000 per week or around £35m over the course of his contract. It makes him the ninth-best-paid player in the entire Premier League. Willian is, however, the second best-paid player at Arsenal, as Mesut Ozil pockets £350,000 a week. Captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is also set to sign a £250,000-a-week deal with the club. PREMIER LEAGUE’S TOP EARNING STARS

The West Africa Examinations Council (WAEC) has insisted that none of its question papers for the ongoing West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) has been leaked. This year’s examination started on Monday, August 17 and has been marred with reports of alleged circulation of question papers. But in a statement by its Head of Public Affairs, Demainus Ojijeogu, WAEC maintained there was no leaked question paper. “There has been no leakage of any paper, whatsoever. Some have even gone ahead to misquote the head of the National Office of WAEC Nigeria, Mr. Patrick Areghan, as confirming the same. “This is far from the truth and we take very strong exception to it. “The council’s monitoring/investigations have revealed that some unscrupulous and unpatriotic supervisors/invigilators, and in some cases, candidates, snap the question papers (while the examination is in progress) and forward to their outside collaborators who in turn, provide solutions to the questions which they send to their subscribers via criminally-inclined websites, SMS and WhatsApp, even as this is against our regulation of: use of cell phones in the examination hall is not allowed,” the statement read. The exam body also revealed that “some culprits, who were caught in the act in Bauchi, Nasarawa and Rivers states, have been arrested and will be prosecuted.”

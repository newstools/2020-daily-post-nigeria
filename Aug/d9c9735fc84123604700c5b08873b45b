Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho is ‘excited’ to play for Manchester United, the UK Independent reports. The 20-year-old is tipped to make a £105 million move to Old Trafford this summer. United are hopeful of completing the deal this week, with the club’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and transfer negotiator, Matt Judge locked in talks with Dortmund. However, the Red Devils will look to pay the transfer fee in installments. As things stand, United will pay around £60m upfront, with £45m set to be paid out in stages in 2021 and 2022. There will be no issues agreeing personal terms with Sancho himself, who only left Manchester City for Germany three years ago for just £8m..

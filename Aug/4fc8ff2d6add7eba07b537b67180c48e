When it is running out of battery, the user just needs to turn on this mode under the battery settings.

Users can also go to this mode and check the remaining battery time.

Some may even joke that HUAWEI Y6p is as powerful as a power bank. And in fact, the smartphone can be used as a power bank for other devices! It supports reverse charging that can make full use of its big battery. Just use an OTG cable to connect HUAWEI Y6p with another device that needs recharging and the smartphone can quickly charge the device or accessory, such as headphones. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-832838" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4-1.png" alt="" width="1379" height="776" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4-1.png 1379w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4-1-300x169.png 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image4-1-1024x576.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1379px) 100vw, 1379px"> Long standby time for superior video and audio experience With a longer standby time, users can freely enjoy mobile games, music or videos on their smartphone for the entire day.

Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski, needs five goals to break Cristiano Ronaldo’s record, after scoring twice in their 4-1 win over Chelsea on Saturday night. It took his season’s tally to 53 in all competitions, as the Bundesliga champions progressed with a 7-1 aggregate. The Poland striker now has 13 goals in seven Champions League games so far, four behind the record Ronaldo set for a single season in 2013/2014. However, Lewandowski insists he is more focused on helping Barca beat Barcelona in the quarter-final next Friday. “It’s not a target for me. We have another knockout game to come and have to play really well as a team,” Lewandowski told Sky Germany when asked about Ronaldo’s record. “The most important thing is to play well and reach the next round. We have to show as a team we are better [than Barcelona] in order to reach the semi-finals. “Barcelona are always dangerous and play great football. We have to be at it from the first minute and show our quality. The better team will play in the next round.”

The management of Air Peace has said that the crippling effects of coronavirus pandemic on its operations was responsible for the sack of some pilots and supporting staff. The company made this known in a statement on Monday in Lagos adding that it took the “very painful, but rightful decision”, NAN reports. It also stated that the decision was taken for the betterment of the company. The statement read “The airline could no longer afford to trade the path of being unable to continue to fulfill its financial obligations to its staff, external vendors, aviation agencies, maintenance organizations, insurance companies, banks and other creditors. “Hence, the decision to restructure its entire operations with a view to surviving the hard times. “The pandemic has hit every airline worldwide, so badly that it has become very impossible for airlines to remain afloat without carrying out internal restructuring of their costs. “Anything short of what we have done may have lead to the collapse of an airline which led to reviewing of salaries being paid to all staff. “The new salaries reflect a 0-40 per cent cut of the former salary depending on the salary grades of every staff. “Even after the cuts, it was still obvious that for us to be able to sustain our operations and survive the difficult times, some jobs must inevitably have to go.”

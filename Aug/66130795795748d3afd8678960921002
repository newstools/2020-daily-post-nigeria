Womenâ€™s International League for Peace and Freedom, WILPF, and the Nigerian Women Mediators Network, NWMN, have urged governments at all levels to serve with compassion and ensure sustainable peace in the country. Their call follows the incessant attacks and resultant loss of lives and properties in Kaduna State. They have also called on the government to bring the perpetrators of the violence to book. Speaking at a one-day consultative dialogue with women leaders, the programme convener, Hajia Lantana Abdullahi Bako, said it was necessary to establish the NWMN network office in Kaduna state to educate stakeholders in the conflict. She said the move is the only way to achieve peaceful coexistence in the state. She noted that there was the need to identify influential women mediators for inclusion into the network, pointing out that it would go a long way toward identifying conflict issues that require urgent attention with a view of finding permanent solutions. She said the organization is working to bring together women of political, philosophical and religious backgrounds who are determined to make known the causes of war and work for permanent peace. She explained that the high level of insecurity and the prevalence of violent conflicts in Kaduna State and other parts of Nigeria as well as the present COVID-19 pandemic situation has become a source of worry at all quarters. The National Coordinator stated that the programme will create a safe space for women to share experiences and co-create knowledge towards enhancing a better society devoid of differences that would be detrimental to development, Participants at the dialogue also jointly identified IDPs in some host communities to support with relief materials.

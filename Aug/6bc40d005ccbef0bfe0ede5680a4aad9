Barcelona captain, Lionel Mess, has informed the club’s new manager, Ronald Koeman, that he saw himself closer to leaving the Blaugrana than to stay at Camp Nou, RAC1 reports. Messi communicated to Koeman his intentions for next season in a meeting held on Thursday afternoon at the home of the Argentine captain. The 33-year-old told the Dutchman that he does not see a clear future for Barcelona while conveying his discomfort and displeasure at the situation the Catalan club was experiencing after their 8-2 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League last week. At this meeting, Koeman also explained his project to Messi. DAILY POST recalls that Messi had told Barcelona that he wants to leave the club this summer following their Champions League’s exit in the hands of Bayern. Koeman, who took over from Quique Setién, had described Messi as the best player in the world during his official unveiling on Wednesday, adding that he wants Messi to stay at Barca. Koeman said: “I don’t know if I have to convince Messi. “He is the best player in the world, and you want the best player in the world in your team, not on the other side.”

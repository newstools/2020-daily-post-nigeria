Iran has reacted to the United Nations Security Council’s decision against the United States. On Friday, America failed in its bid to indefinitely extend an arms embargo on Iran. China and Russia voted against, while 11 countries, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany, abstained. Iranian representative at the UN, Majid Ravanchi, warned the U.S. against any further move for sanctions. He said any form of imposition or restrictions by the Security Council “will be met severely by Iran and our options are not limited.” Ravanchi added that “the United States and any entity which may assist it or acquiesce in its illegal behaviour will bear the full responsibility.” Russia President Vladimir Putin, in a statement, called for a summit with the U.S. and other parties on the Iran nuclear deal. He said this would avoid further “confrontation and escalation” at the United Nations over Iran. China’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Amb. Zhang Jun, stated that the rejection showed that “unilateralism receives no support and bullying will fail.” Reacting, Germany explained that it abstained because it was clear that the proposal would fail due to opposition from China and Russia.

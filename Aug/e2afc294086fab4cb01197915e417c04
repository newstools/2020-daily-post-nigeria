President Muhammadu Buhari’s aide, Bashir Ahmad, has reacted to the viral video of Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Aviation Minister who verbally assaulted a Daily Trust reporter, Charles Eyo. Fani-Kayode in the video could be heard raining insults on Eyo over his choice of question, while disclosing that he has a short fuse. The incident which occurred in Calabar, the Cross River State, has attracted condemnation from Nigerians. Explaining his action, Fani-Kayode had claimed that his political enemies sent the reporter to embarrass him. The Daily Trust reporter had sought to know who bankrolled Fani-Kayode’s tour of the state. But the former Minister got offended and described him as being stupid, accusing him of being sponsored by his perceived enemies to embarrass him. Reacting, Ahmad who is Buhari’s Special Assistant on New Media said people don’t have short fuse but are not properly trained. In a tweet, Ahmad wrote: “Personally, I don’t believe in a short fuse, if you’re well-trained, you’re well-trained. I was taught from my early days that no matter how provoked, it shouldn’t ever be an excuse for me to insult others, especially those who are older than me. One of my principles!” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-833704" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200826_111021_788.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="770" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200826_111021_788.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200826_111021_788-281x300.jpg 281w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200826_111021_788-560x600.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

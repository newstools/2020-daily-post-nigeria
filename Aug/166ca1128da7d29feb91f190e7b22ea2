Manchester City midfielder, Kevin De Bruyne, has sent an emotional message to playmaker, David Silva, after the Spaniard announced his departure from the club on Monday. Silva announced his exit from Man City after ten years at Etihad on Monday. The 34-year-old in a statement via his official Twitter page, said: “The time has arrived. Ten years and 13 titles later, It’s time for me to say goodbye to the club that has left an indelible mark on my life and career. “I look back, and it’s clear I could not have made a better decision than to accept City’s proposal to join their project back in 2010. “I hope that City will achieve even bigger triumphs in the future. “I want to send every Cityzen a huge hug.” Reacting, De Bruyne said he was sad to see Silva leave Man City. The Belgium international, however, wished the former Valencia star all the best in the future. “Sad to see this man leave the club after an incredible ten years. It was an honour to play with and wish you all the best in the future my friend @21LVA,” De Bruyne wrote on Twitter.

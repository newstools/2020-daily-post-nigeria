ThebAll Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in Edo, Osagie Ize-Iyamu, has spoken out on the August 13 violence at a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rally. The event was held at Apana in Etsako-West Local Government Area. On Saturday at a press briefing in Benin, Ize-Iyamu denied allegations of culpability. The flagbearer stated that the APC has been peaceful during its campaigns and would never engage in unruly acts. “We heard of so much violence during the PDP rally in Etsako-West and they are accusing us for the destruction and shooting. We did not go near their activities. “We have eyewitnesses of people who committed the act at Apana, Etsako-West. There is no time that we, or our followers have destroyed property belonging to the opposition parties.” Ize-Iyamu promised to ensure that the perpetrators were arrested and prosecuted by security agencies. The APC candidate disclosed that petitions have been written on the fracas. “We intend to follow up. We have a list of people involved. They were not policemen, they were known thugs of the PDP”, he declared.

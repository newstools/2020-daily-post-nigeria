A former England and Manchester United captain, Wayne Rooney, has backed Paris Saint-Germain to beat Bayern Munich in tonight’s Champions League final fixture at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal. Rooney believes his former Manchester United teammate, Angel Di Maria, could be the match-winner for PSG against Bayern Munich. PSG defeated RB Leipzig in the Champions League semi-final a few days ago, while Bayern eliminated Lyon from the competition. Writing in his column for Sunday Times, Rooney said: “Bayern have the advantage that most of their starting line-up have played in the Champions League final before. But I’ve got a feeling for PSG. “It will be a shoot-out, and I think with Neymar, Mbappe and Di Maria, PSG will exploit the high line that Bayern play. They’ll get chances and take them. “I’ve no doubt that the press will create chances for Bayern, but PSG are good enough in possession to deal with it, and once they play through it there’ll be opportunities for their attackers. “PSG’s match-winner might just be Di Maria. He is a wonderful player. He works tirelessly on the pitch, and his delivery, vision and awareness are brilliant.” The kick-off time for the match is 8 pm.

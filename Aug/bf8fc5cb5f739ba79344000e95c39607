Odion Ighalo is not interested in leaving Manchester United for Paris Saint-Germain, according to MEN Sport. United are understood to have no intention of cutting his loan spell short, and the player himself has insisted there is “no truth at all” behind the speculations. Reports in France initially suggested the Ligue 1 champions were looking to snap up Ighalo, as replacement for Edinson Cavani who leaves as a free agent. Ighalo only extended his loan spell with the Red Devils until the end of January next year. And any summer departure would require the mutual termination of his current deal. The Nigerian striker has netted five goals in 18 appearances since moving to Old Trafford in January 2020 and is delighted to be representing his boyhood club. He is part of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s squad for the Europa League semi-final against Sevilla on Sunday night.

In a bid to rid the beleaguered Ire Ekiti, Oye Local Government Area of Ekiti State of light weapons following death of two persons due to internal crisis, the police have begun a mop-up operation in the community to halt arms proliferation. The Ire Ekiti had been embroiled in crisis since Sunday over directive by Onire, Oba Victor Bobade banning the celebration of the annual Ogun Onire Festival to prevent further spread of COVID-19. The action considered as provocative to Ogun worshipers had led to an onslaught on the palace of Oba Bobade, where two persons were killed and a car burnt in the process. The police have arrested one person in connection with the bloody crisis and scores have been declared wanted. In a statement in Ado Ekiti, on Wednesday, the Police Commissioner, Mr Babatunde Mobayo, said the operation became expedient to halt further killings and proliferation of light arms in the town. The statement signed by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Sunday Abutu, said: “In order to restore peace to the Community, the Commissioner of Police wishes to inform the people of Ire-Ekiti that the Police shall be carrying out a mop-up operation and investigation to fish out the perpetrators in the Community from the hour of 6:00am today,12th August, 2020. “In view of this, the Commissioner implores the people of Ire-Ekiti Community to be law-abiding, cooperate with the Police deployed and avoid any act that could frustrate the aim of the operation, as such adverse act shall not be tolerated”. Mobayo observed with dismay, how some “unscrupulous” persons in their large number had taken to the streets, destroying property, causing injuries and death of innocent citizens and consequently causing a state of anarchy and unnecessary apprehension.

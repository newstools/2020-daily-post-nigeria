Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya has revealed plans for Laycon outside the show. Kiddwaya and Laycon have been friends despite Laycon’s interest in Erica. Kiddwaya has always made boast that Laycon is not someone he would fight with over Erica. However, speaking after their Pepsi task on Wednesday night, Kiddwaya commended Laycon for his performance and promised to help him promote his music outside the house. Kiddwaya to Laycon: “After the house I will connect you so you perform at one musicfest. You have a good talent.” Laycon was a budding artiste before he made his way to the BBNaija house and has stolen the heart of some viewers in this season with his talent. The likes of Nigerian musicians, Reminisce, Ozladeofficial, Chinko Ekun and other celebrities have chosen Laycon as their favourite housemate. Going from the votes from viewers, Laycon is likely to be among the five housemates to make it to the final week of the season. Laycon, as well as Kiddwaya, Erica, Dorathy, Nengi and Ozo have never appeared on list of four housemates with lowest votes.

Juventus have reportedly made forward, Paulo Dybala available for sale this summer transfer, Express UK reports. The Serie A champions have also made it clear that they will only accept an extremely lucrative bid from any interested clubs for Dybala. The report also added that the Argentina international is not part of the club’s new manager, Andrea Pirlo’s plans for next season. DAILY POST recalls that this is coming less than a week after Pirlo put six Juventus players for sale this summer. Pirlo was appointed as Juventus new head coach over last weekend following the sacking of Maurizio Sarri. The Italy legend is now ready to wield the axe and get rid of players who do not fit his system, and Dybala appears to be the first name to go. Dybala had drawn the interest of Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in the past. Juventus are expected to demand a huge fee of £100million for Dybala, and will sell the player if any club can meet their demands.

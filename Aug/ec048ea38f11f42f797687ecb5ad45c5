The entertainment industry seems to be suffering a setback as cinemas, clubs still remain closed despite reopening of markets and churches in Nigeria. In this regards, Nollywood actors have begun an online protest tagged ‘Save cinemas’ calling on the federal government to lift the ban on the closure of cinemas nationwide. The online protest tagged hashtag ‘Save Cinemas’ flooded timelines with posts from actors and filmmakers such as Omotola Jalade-Ekeinde, Rita Dominic, and Falz. Falz lamented that the continued closure of cinema is stifling the growth of the entertainment industry. Veteran actress, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde on her Instagram page wrote: “I believe cinemas are easier to monitor and regulate. If other indoor places are open, why not the Cinemas? Temp checks, masks, distancing etc. “We need to work together to ensure safer ways to keep the Arts going . Many livelihoods depend on this. It can and MUST be done as safely as possible. #savecinemas”. Rita Dominic alongside a video showing countries that have reopened cinemas and practicing social distancing wrote: ‘Save Cinema’ Osas Ighodaro on her Instagram page wrote: “Please reopen cinemas, with safety and enjoyability intact of course.”

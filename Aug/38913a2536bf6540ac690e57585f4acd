Head, West African Examination Council (WAEC), Mr Patrick Areghan, has given updates on candidates infected with the COVID-19. Areghan advised students battling COVID-19 and writing the ongoing examinations not to panic, saying the virus is not a death sentence. Areghan said this on Wednesday during a monitoring visit to Federal Government Boys College, Apo, Abuja adding that no student infected with COVID-19 would miss the examinations. He disclosed that the council would thereafter proceed to the isolation centre and collect the script which would be put in a special bank designated for the purpose. “I want to assure that anywhere we have COVID-19 candidate, we make sure that he or she writes the examinations. It is not a death sentence, there is no stigma. “We do not want anybody to miss the exams. It’s no fault of theirs. We can defeat this virus provided we take first-line responsibility,” he added. The Head of National Office, WAEC in Nigeria noted that the council had been collaborating with various states’ ministry of education to monitor candidates infected with the virus. According to him, When a candidate is confirmed positive, the ministry of education and the ministry of health in the state will unite and get a medical expert that will conduct the exam for the candidate in the isolation centre, NAN reports. “Yes, we are aware that in Gombe, Kwara and Bayelsa that there were candidates infected with the virus,” Areghan confirmed.

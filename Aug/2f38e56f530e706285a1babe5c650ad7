Shinzo Abe, the Prime Minister of Japan, has resigned. He cited health reasons for the resignation. Abe, 65, explained that he did not want his illness to affect decision-making. The PM apologized to the Japanese people for failing to complete his term in office. “I made a judgement I should not continue my job as a prime minister,” he said. “I would like to sincerely apologize to the people of Japan for leaving my post with one year left in my term of office, and amid the coronavirus woes, while various policies are still in the process of being implemented.” Abe has suffered from ulcerative colitis since he was a teenager. In 2007, Abe resigned abruptly because of his struggles. In 2019, he became Japan’s longest serving Prime Minister.

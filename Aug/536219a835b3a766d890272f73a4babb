Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya has finally spoken about Laycon’s feelings for Erica. Laycon in the past few days had developed feelings and declared his intention to be in a relationship with Erica. However, Erica rejected him saying she has physical connection with Kiddwaya and just mentally attracted to him. Laycon since then had suffered rejection and had told Biggie and other housemates that he feels pained each time he sees Erica with Kiddwaya kissing and having romantic moments. Kidd who has kept mute about Laycon’s move on Friday night told Erica that Laycon does not really want her. According to him, Laycon never made his intention known to Erica until he started seeing them together. During a conversation with Erica, he said: “If Laycon liked you back earlier why did he not make a move. “He does not want you. If he wanted you, he would have let you know before we started being close to each other and hanging out. “He never showed his intention until we started hanging out.” Here you can hear #Erica and #Kidd making jest of #Laycon #BBNaijialockdown2020 #BBNaijaLockdown #LAYCONtent #NengiTheAlphaFemale pic.twitter.com/W9JWzkklIg — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 8, 2020

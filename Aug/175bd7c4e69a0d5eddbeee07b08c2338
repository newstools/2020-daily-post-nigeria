Governor Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State has described the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, as a liability and a woeful failure. Ganduje said the power of incumbency won’t work in the forthcoming governorship election in Edo State. He spoke at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, after a meeting between some members of the All Progressives Congress, APC, and President Muhammadu Buhari, on Friday. He noted that Obaseki can’t win the upcoming election due to his poor performance. Ganduje said Obaseki failed in providing infrastructure and executing constitutional provision in the state. According to Ganduje, Obaseki’s abysmal performance would make the election an easy win for APC. Ganduje said, “Your question is that we are contesting against a serving governor in Edo State. Yes, that is a very important question at this material time. It could have been a big problem if the governor performs well while governing his state. “He could have been an asset to the PDP. “But, I assure you that the governor is a liability. In fact, it is even better for us that we are contesting with a serving governor who failed woefully. “He failed woefully in the area of human development. He failed woefully in the area of providing infrastructural facilities to the good people of Edo State, he failed most woefully in the execution of constitutional provision in the state, especially pertaining to the legislature.” APC leaders had visited Buhari in company of the party’s governorship candidate in Edo State, Osagie Ize-Iyamu. During the meeting, Buhari had endorsed Ize-Iyamu and urged all party members to ensure APC wins Edo State.

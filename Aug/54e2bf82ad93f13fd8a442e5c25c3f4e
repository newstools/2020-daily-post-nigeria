Secondary Schools in Delta State on Tuesday resumed academic activities with total compliance to the protocols put in place by the State Government to curtail the spread of the dreaded COVID-19 pandemic. The schools resumed after over four months holiday due to the COVID-19 pandemic amid low turnout of students. In a chat with newsmen, the Zonal Coordinator of Institute of Continuing Education, ICE, Warri Zone, Dr Ochuko Ushure said that the school had observed all the protocols provided by the government. In his words,”We have buckets, water, soap, and hand sanitizers at various locations in the school premises for the students to wash their hands. “We also ensure that they maintain social distancing, before resumption, we ensure that the classrooms are clean with soap and water. “We also ensure that the students wear their face mask always directly from the school gate”. Ushure who expressed hope that more students would start coming to school said that about 147 students were expected to sit for the external exams in the school. Also, the Vice Principal of Uwangwe College, Mr Benjamin Akpobasa said that the school had complied with all the directives by the state government on the global pandemic. “We have internal task force monitoring compliance to the COVID-19 rules in the school”. Akpobasa, however, appealed to parents to enable them to implement government’s directives. “When parents fail to do what they are supposed to do, it will become a problem. “It is an issue of health, we cannot leave it all alone to the government. “We have 261 candidates sitting for the exam and the classrooms are enough to accommodate them “. Some of the students expressed joy over their resumption, assuring that they would observe all the safety protocols.

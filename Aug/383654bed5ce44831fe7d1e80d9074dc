Big Brother Naija, housemate, Nengi on Monday apologised to Big Brother for her attitude in the house. Nengi almost got a strike on Saturday after she shoved Kaisha during a heated argument, which is against the rules in the reality show. However, Big Brother gave her a final warning on Sunday, adding that another act of disobedience would result in consequences, higher than a strike. Speaking during her Monday diary session with Biggie, Nengi said she feels terrible about the situation and regrets her actions. She said: “I’m sorry for acting that way, it wouldn’t happen again. I’m not the kind of person that condones insult and I like to respect people and want them to respect me too. “I felt Kaisha had bad energy towards me all of a sudden reasons why our fight blew out of proportion. “I should have not made moved towards Kaisha and resisted “ I felt bad about the situation and I apologise. I regret the situation.” About last night’s eviction, which had Kaisha kicked out of the show, Nengi said she was shocked by the nominations and those on the bottom four. She added that the situation has made her question her actions as she feels things are so unpredictable especially with seeing Neo up among the bottom four.

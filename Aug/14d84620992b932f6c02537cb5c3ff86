Edo deputy governor, Philip Shaibu, has declared that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has won the governorship poll. The election will be held on September 19. Shaibu spoke on Thursday in Jattu, Etsako West Local Government Area. He expressed joy over the large turnout of supporters at the party’s campaign rallies. Shuabu, while addressing supporters in his Ward 11, said: “With the crowd, I see here, this election is won by PDP already.” He noted that the poll “is for the liberation of the people. The governor is bringing development closer to the people.” Shaibu further urged them to remain steadfast. “You people have been with me since when I was in the House of Assembly. Give me the same support and I will not disappoint you,” he said. Governor Godwin Obaseki promised the people that they would not be betrayed. “As a government, we must continue to pay salaries, pensions, and create employment. We won’t allow few people to distract us from achieving greatness,” he added.

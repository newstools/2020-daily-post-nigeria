The Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress and former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Dr Obadiah Mailafia on Monday honoured another invitation by the Directorate of State Services (DSS) which was extended to him at the weekend. DAILY POST recalls that it is the second time in five days that the DSS is interrogating Mr. Mailafia over comments he made on radio, concerning Boko Haram. Mailafia had alleged that a repentant bandit told him that a serving northern governor was a commander of the terrorist group. The DSS had on Friday in a statement signed by its Spokesperson, Dr. Peter Afunanya said, “It is even more condemnable that Mailafiya, who had profusely apologized during his visit to the Service’s Plateau State Command for his ignoble statement, would, afterwards, announce to the world that he stood by his misguided eruption”. Mailafia who confirmed getting another invitation by the DSS at the weekend told journalists at the DSS state Headquarters in Jos on Monday that he doesn’t know why he was being summoned again. Meanwhile, after being grilled for over an hour, he was released again. Speaking to journalists after the release of his client, Counsel to Mailafiya, Yakubu Bawa, said, “My client was invited to clarify some issues which he has done. Bawa said, “He was not manhandled, was treated courteously, but we hope this will be the last invitation”, he maintained. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-829909 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AA-2-1000x480-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="480" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AA-2-1000x480-1.jpg 1000w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/AA-2-1000x480-1-300x144.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px">

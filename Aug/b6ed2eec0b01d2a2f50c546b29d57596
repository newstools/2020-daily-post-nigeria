Big Brother Naija housemate, Prince has cleared the air on having sex with his lover, Tolanibaj in the house. Both housemates have shown likeness for each other and have become lovers in the show. However, Tolanibaj feels he is not expressing himself more and is holding back in their relationship. Responding, Prince said he is holding back in order not to get too attached and have sex on national Tv. Prince said: “I enjoy kisses and cuddles but I am holding back from expressing more because I don’t want us to get to a point where we cannot control our emotions and have sex on national television.” Tolani responding, agreed with him, adding that she does not want to have sex too in the house. Meanwhile, all housemates except Tolanibaj and Kiddway are up for eviction this week.

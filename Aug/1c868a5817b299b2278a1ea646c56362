New Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has revealed the conversation he had with Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, about Lionel Messi. City is one of the clubs Messi has been linked with this summer, as uncertainty surrounds his future in Spain. But Koeman, speaking to Nos, says he hopes to convince the player to remain at the Camp Nou. According to the Dutchman, he has spoken to Guardiola who coached Messi at Barca for four years and given him tips on how to make the six-time Ballon D’Or winner happy. “Messi is a pure winner. All his managers have said that. I’m close with Pep Guardiola and we’re still in touch. Pep told me that Messi wants to win. He wants to win everything. If he doesn’t win, he can get very annoyed. “I have to make sure he’s able to function well in this team. I have to make sure he feels important. He’s the captain of this club. He has to finish his career here. Messi is Barcelona and Barcelona is Messi,” Koeman said.

An Arabic and Islamic teacher, Ismaila Saheed, 38, and one Toliha Sabith, 20, have been arrested by the police for allegedly defiling a 15-year-old girl in Ogun. The Ogun State Police Command confirmed the incident to DAILY POST in a statement signed by its Spokesperson, Abimbola Oyeyemi, on Monday. The police said the suspects were apprehended following a report by the victim at the Redeemed Camp police station. The victim, according to Oyeyemi, told the police that Toliha Sabith had forcefully had carnal knowledge of her on August 25 at Imedu-nla area of Mowe. After the incident, she was said to have gone to Saheed, her Arabic and Islamic teacher to inform him. Having listened to her ordeal, the Arabic teacher told her that she might have been impregnated by Sabith, as a result of the defilement. He offered to help her abort the imaginary pregnancy. “But surprisingly, instead of removing the imaginary pregnancy, he also had carnal knowledge of her, after which he inserted a sharp object into her private part, causing her a serious vaginal injury. “Upon the report, the DPO, Redeemed Camp Division, SP Bala Yakubu, detailed his detectives to go after the two suspects and they were both apprehended on the 28th of August 2020. They have confessed to the commission of the crime,” Oyeyemi informed. He revealed that the victim is currently admitted in a hospital for medical attention.

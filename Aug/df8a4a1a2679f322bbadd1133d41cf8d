The ruling of Lagos High Court sitting in Ikeja on the no-case submissions made by Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike, aka Evans and co-defandants is expected today. Justice Hakeem Oshodi is presiding over the kidnap and murder trial. His pronouncement will determine whether or not the case will continue. Ogechi Uchechukwu, Chilaka Ifeanyi, Okwuchukwu Nwachukwu and Victor Aduba want the charges against them dismissed. Only the second defendant, Uche Amadi, did not file a no-case submission. The defence counsels – Roger Adewole, Olanrewaju Ajanaku, M. C. Izokwu and Emmanuel Ochai – are urging the court to dismiss the case. But Lagos State, through the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Moyosore Onigbanjo, is opposing their demand. At the last sitting, Oshodi ordered an Office of Public Defender counsel, E. E. Okonkwo, to take over Evans’ defence. This was after the court was informed that Evans was broke and could not hire a lawyer.

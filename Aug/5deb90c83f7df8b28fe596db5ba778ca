Paris Saint-Germain, Nasser Al-Khelaifi, has expressed his delight after the club qualified for their first ever Champions League final. The Ligue 1 champions outclassed RB Leipzig 3-0, to book their place in Sunday’s final against Bayern Munich or domestic rivals Lyon. Marquinho and Angel Di Maria gave PSG a two-goal lead at the break, before Juan Bernat added a third in the second half. According to Al-Khelaifi, this has always been the dream since they took over nine years ago. “This is a historic night for the club, magnificent, I am proud for the club, this is our 1st final. Honestly, this is a dream but we must not stop tonight. “Since 2011 and our arrival here, our dream was the Champions’ League and we are close to our dream,” Al-Khelaifi told RMC.

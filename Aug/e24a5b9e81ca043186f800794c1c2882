The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, on Monday visited President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa. This was disclosed by Bashir Ahmad, the President’s Special Assistant on New Media. He, however, did not give details of the meeting as both men are still in a closed-door meeting. Ahmad tweeted, “@MBuhari receives in audience General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (@rccghq), @PastorEAAdeboye, at the State House, Abuja.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has played down Bruno Fernandes’ on-field clash with Victor Lindelof during their Europa League semi-final defeat to Sevilla. Speaking after the game, Solskjaer said he wanted his players to be able to hold each other to account for making mistakes. United took the lead after Fernandes slotted home a first-half penalty. However, Solskjaer’s men were punished for missed chances, after Suso tapped in at the back post. Second-half substitute Luuk de Jong got on the end of Jesus Navas’ cross to win the game in the 78th minute. After the goal, Fernandes ripped into Lindelof for his part in the goal, which led the pair screaming at each other angrily. When asked about the clash between his two players, Solskjaer responded: “Maybe it’s a disappointing goal to concede and I want players to be accountable and hold others to account. “Then again, the cross got deflected, Brandon got a bit unlucky, Victor just gets caught with the ball looping over him after that deflection, so I think that was just a bit of frustration that took the boys.”

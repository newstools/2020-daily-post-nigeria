Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemate, Vee, has advised Laycon to stay away from Erica and stop being emotionally blackmailed. Erica before making her decision on her deputy head of house approached Laycon and told him she trusts him and feels safer with him. However, Laycon, who has been finding it difficult to move on from Erica on Monday night got really upset after she chose Kiddwaya as deputy HOH despite speaking with him earlier. This got Vee and Neo upset as they approached Laycon, advising him to stay away from Erica and focus on his game in the reality show. Vee told Laycon: “Keep your distance, stay away from Erica. “You are a good friend and have patience, but put your first now because she has chosen Kiddwaya. “You are not in this house for a girl, accept what it is. “Avoid her and tell her straight to her face that you need to be alone. “Do not allow anyone to emotionally blackmail you. “You have other people that care about you, I and Neo are here. Stay with us and stay away from her.” Neo and Vee advise #Laycon on #Erica #bbnaijialockdown #BBNaija  #bbnaijalockdown2020 pic.twitter.com/arMkjSeRBZ — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 10, 2020

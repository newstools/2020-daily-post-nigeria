Three soldiers and one vigilante have allegedly been killed during an operation to rescue a Chinese national and his driver kidnapped by unidentified gunmen in Yakila, Rafi local government area of Niger State. The Chinese expatriate along with his driver were abducted at a construction firm in the Yakila area a few weeks ago. It was gathered that the victims in a rescue mission to save the expatriate and his driver lost their lives during an exchange of fire with the armed bandits, alleged to be 30 in number. An eyewitness account told our reporter that the gunmen stormed Yakila on 15 motorbikes with passengers on the back of each bike, heavily armed. The eyewitness said the soldiers, however, arrested one bandit and two motorcycles belonging to the gunmen. “Two motorcycles were seen inside the Hilux vehicle of the Army with one person arrested whose face was tied with cloth. And, also corpses of the attackers suspected to be bandits were sighted in the truck, I can not tell the exact number.” Efforts to get the reaction of the state Police Command through the Public Relations Officer, PRO, Wasiu Abiodun failed as calls put through to him were not responded to as at the time of filing this report. However, the Senior Special Assistant to Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello on security matters, Colonel MK Maikundi (retired) confirmed the development in the area. The Governor’s aide explained that currently, security agencies have been drafted to the area where some bandits were equally killed.

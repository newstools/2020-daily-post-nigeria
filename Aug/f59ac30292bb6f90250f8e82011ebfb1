Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church has called on the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to allow churches in the state to open during weekdays. Oyedepo said it was strange that the Lagos State government won’t allow churches to open during weekdays. The state government recently ordered the reopening of worship centres across the state only on Saturdays and Sundays in a bid to curb the spread of COVID-19. Reacting, the clergyman while addressing his followers during worship service at Canaanland, Ogun State wondered if Nigeria was still a circular state. Stating that other state governments have allowed churches to open during weekends, Oyedepo called for the replication of the same in Lagos State. According to Oyedepo: “I also heard something very strange last night that Lagos churches open only on Sundays. If I heard well, the markets open every day, public transport opens every day. Is Nigeria still a circular state? Churches in the north open everyday. “My sincere advice to the authority is that please, review your stand. Since the SS3 students resume, is there an outbreak? The churches in Kano opens about two months now, is there any outbreak? Kogi opens earlier on, any outbreak? Before the church will turn to somebody’s pocket, it is time for God to act.”

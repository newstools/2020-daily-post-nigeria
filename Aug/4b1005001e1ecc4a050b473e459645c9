Governor Bello Mohammed Matawalle of Zamfara State has decried wrong attitude of politicians and political office holders towards the traditional institutions in the country. The governor expressed this worry when the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero paid him a courtesy visit in his office. He said that politicians, especially political office holders, severally accord great degree of disrespect to the institution which he said, contributes to downgrading of its worth in the eyes of followers. “As politicians and political office holders, we must realise that the traditional institution is the permanent leadership structure in our society. It is our original heritage which we must preserve and respect”, Matawalle said. “We must realise that after our tenure in office, most of us are still coming back to the Palace under the Emirs once again. “So, if we allow the institution to wallow in disrespect, how can we get respect after our tenure has ended”? Governor Matawalle asked. He called on all politicians and political office holders to realise that the society cannot be safe if the traditional institutions are not carried along as elders who show the way. According to him, the responsibility of realising a cohesive and obedient followership is easily achieved through a strong and firm traditional institution.

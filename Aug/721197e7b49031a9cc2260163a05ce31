The National Emergency Management Agency, NEMA, on Friday, warned that 102 local governments across the country as well as 28 states might experience flooding due to impending heavy rainfall. The Agency’s Director of Operations in charge of Ekiti, Ondo and Osun States, Mr. Olusegun Afolayan gave the alert in Akure, the Ondo State capital. While stressing that the alert is coming on the heels of the warnings from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, NiMeT, on the weather forecast, Afolayan the move was part of the agency’s pro-activeness to responding to warning alerts by different agencies dealing with weather. According to him, the states under his jurisdiction were also part of the 28 states and the 102 local governments that were risk prone to flooding. —

The Federal Government has said that the registration for the National Examination Council (NECO) for SS3 students and also the National Business and Technical Examination Board (NABTEB) will continue running as WAEC is set to begin examination on August 17. The Minister of State for Education, Mr. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, who said this at the media briefing of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 in Abuja on Monday, urged school teachers to continuously engage the students ahead of the examinations. Nwajiuba said, “Once the WAEC examination starts on August 17, it will run till the middle of September and NABTEB will start immediately and run till October. He said “NECO examination will start on October 10, about a week to the end of NABTEB and run through to November. “We expect that throughout the period, students are working and learning. “We don’t just want them to be in school and be playing. This is the exit class. It says a lot about the six years spent in secondary school. “Right now, we are lifting the registration for NABTEB and NECO, continuously running, even while we are about to begin WAEC. “All examinations are a test of outcomes. We will want our teachers to continuously engage the students,” he said.

The Department of State Services (DSS) has invited Dr. Obadiah Mailafiya, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for questioning again. His lawyer, Yakubu Bawa, disclosed this to newsmen on Monday in Jos, NAN reports According to him, Mailafiya is expected to be at the Jos office of the DSS on Monday by 12 noon. Bawa said the invitation was in connection with Mailafiya’s encounter with the DSS last week. “I believed it wouldn’t be anything different from the last encounter with DSS, which was purely interactive,” he said. Recall that the former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, had alleged that a northern governor was the Commander of Boko Haram. He also alleged that Boko Haram insurgents were plotting civil war in 2022. In response to his allegation, DSS had invited him for questioning which he honored. However, speaking after his interrogation, he declared that he stood by his earlier revelations on Boko Haram.

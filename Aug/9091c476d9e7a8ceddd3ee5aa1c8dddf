Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemate, Erica on Friday night broke down in tears. It all started after Erica said she doesn’t like to chase guys. Wathoni, then made a comment to Kiddwaya in the group discussion, saying “You did not chase any girl in this house.” Erica immediately put her on the spot and asked what she meant by that but Wathoni became speechless. This got Erica questioning her stand with Kiddwaya as he admitted that he does not chase girls. Erica got pissed and went into the head of house lounge where she broke down and started crying. She further told Kiddwaya that she regrets and feels stupid for being with him in the first place. According to her, this is not the first time Kiddwaya would not stand up for her in front of the housemates. Erica said: “This is the second in public you don’t have my back. “I feel very stupid for being with you in the first place. “I don’t have any issues with Wathoni but why did she say you did not chase any girl immediately after I said I don’t like to chase guys? “You stood there and did not stand up for me.” ERICA TO KIDD I FEEL VERY STUPID FOR HAVING ANYTHING TO DO WITH YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE #bbnaijalockdown2020 #bbnaija pic.twitter.com/gLWiRSWzMF — OLAYIDE 💫😊 (@Lidnett) August 14, 2020

A youth Group in Kano State has advocated the enactment of a strict legal framework to allow severe punishment against hate speech perpetrators. The group under the aegis of Kano State Youths Forum urged the state Assembly to amend the law on hate speech to provide a strict punishment against anyone found guilty of hate speech on social media. The group made the call in a press statement signed and issued to newsmen by their state Coordinator, Mudassir Hamza Dankaka. According to the statement, “we are calling on the assembly to amend the law concerning hate speech so that serious punishment will be in place against anyone found guilty of hate speech, especially on Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Twitter.” The group also commended the State Government for endorsing the death sentence passed on 22-year-old Yahaya Sharif-Aminu by the upper Shari’a court for blaspheming. Sharif-Aminu, a resident of Sharifai quarters in Kano municipal, was sued for “insulting religious creed, contrary to section 382 (b) of Kano State Sharia Penal Code Law 2000.” The Shari’a court, presided by Khadi Aliyu Muhammad Kani, found him guilty of the charge and ordered that he be hanged to death, Ganduje applauded the judgment while speaking at Africa House, Government House, Kano, in a “Special Meeting” with Muslim Ulamahs.

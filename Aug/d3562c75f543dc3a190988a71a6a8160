Big Brother Naija, BBNaija ‘Lockdown’ housemate, Laycon seems to have a love interest in fellow female housemate, Erica. However, it seems he would have a difficult time having a relationship with Erica after what happened last night between her and Kiddwaya. Just few hours before both housemates were caught having sex, Laycon had approached Erica to tell how he feels about her. According to him, he likes and really cares about Erica but would not pressure her into accepting him. Laycon said: “I’ll be really mad if I was evicted yesterday from the house before saying this. “I like you and care about you in this house. I am saying this seriously so you would know not to pressure you.” Erica in response said she also likes Laycon and was hundred percent sure his likeness for her is not physical. “I am a possessive person if I like someone I would not want them around other people, ” Erica added. Recall that Erica had told Wathoni that she cannot date Kiddwaya even if she’s blind because they have just physical and no mental connection. I think Laycon convinced Erica to have sex with Kiddwaya#BBNaijaLockdown #BBNaija #bbnajia2020 pic.twitter.com/SKGHb2gNFu — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 3, 2020

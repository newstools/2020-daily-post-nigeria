Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski, has said that he deserves to win the Ballon d’Or prize this season. Organisers of the award, France Football, last month announced the event will not hold this year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lewandowski would have been a hot favourite to win it, having netted 55 times in all competitions for the German side. His goals helped Bayern win the Treble – Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League. The 32-year-old insists the Ballon d’Or was never on his mind this term, but he thinks he would have been a worthy winner. When asked which player he would have given the award to, Lewandowski told Onet and Przeglad Sportowy: “Myself. We won everything there was to win. I won the award for top goalscorer in every competition. I think a player who achieves this would win the Ballon d’Or.”ty67yujm                  hj

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemate, Laycon has disclosed who he would choose as deputy head of house if he wins next week. The head of house task is performed weekly by housemates and the winner gets immunity from possible eviction. The head of house is expected to choose a deputy of the opposite gender to share the luxury room for the week. Laycon was snubbed by Erica on Monday night for the position of deputy head of house. Speaking to Brighto about his love triangle, Laycon said he would have chosen Kaisha not Erica, as everyone thinks, to be his deputy if he becomes the head of house. “I would choose Kaisha if I won Head of house. I love her personality,” Laycon said. His statement comes right after Erica, who emerged Head of House for the week, chose her love interest, Kiddwaya, as her deputy even though Laycon was in her head moments before she was called by Biggie to make a decision. This ‘Lockdown edition has 16 housemates battling for N65m for 71 days. At least one out of the 14 housemates up for possible eviction will exit the house on Sunday and the housemates have the power to decide who leaves. Each housemate, including head and deputy head of house has the power to nominate one of the bottom four housemates with the lowest votes from the fans. The housemate/s with the highest votes from the fellow housemates gets evicted from the house. So far, Ka3na, Lilo, Eric and Tochi have been evicted from the reality show.

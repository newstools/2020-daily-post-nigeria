Barcelona President, Josep Maria Bartomeu, has insisted that midfielder, Phillippe Coutinho, can stay at Camp Nou if the club’s new manager, Ronald Koeman wants him amid interest from Arsenal. Barcelona is keen to sell Coutinho this summer’s transfer window and the player’s agent, Kia Joorabchian, has held talks with Arsenal over a potential deal. Coutinho, who is currently on loan at Bayern Munich, is set to join Arsenal on another loan this summer. Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, is a huge admirer of Coutinho. “Coutinho can stay here, if Koeman wants him,” Bartomeu was quoted by Express UK as saying. “The head coach will make the decision.” Arsenal will have to wait and see what Koeman wants to do with Coutinho after lining up a deal for the 28-year-old. Coutinho joined Barcelona in January 2018 from Liverpool for a £145 million deal. He helped Bayern to win the domestic league and cup double this season.

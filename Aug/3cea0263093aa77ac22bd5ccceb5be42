Prince had shown interest in Tolanibaj, Nengi, and Wathoni since he got in the BBNaija house. However, he is yet to make a decision. On Thursday night, Tolanibaj engaged in a conversation where she challenged him to prove he wants her in his life. Tolanibaj told him to put in efforts if he wants to have her as his girlfriend. “I am challenging you to be the best boyfriend but if you don’t like the challenge you can leave. “You like me but how many girls have you told that here. “Put in the effort for me, I am the prize if you don’t see me for who I am i’ll leave you,” she said. Recall that Prince had told his fellow male housemates that he would stay away from Nengi if she kept switching between him and Ozo Meanwhile, Wathoni had told Prince to make his clear intentions known among female housemates and stop sitting on the fence. According to her, he is the reason for the hostility between the ladies in the house and needs to make it public if he is dating Nengi.

Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has reacted to the death of ex-Ogun Senator, Buruji Kashamu. Obasanjo said despite using politics to maneuver the law to escape justice, Kashamu could not escape death. Kashamu, prior to his death, was involved in a legal tussle with the federal government over extradition to the United States, US, over alleged drug trafficking. However, the former Senator died on Saturday due to complications from COVID-19. Reacting to his death, Obasanjo said the life of Kashamu should be a lesson to those still alive. In a statement by his spokesman, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo said Kashamu’s life and history left “lessons for those of us on this side of the veil.” “Senator Buruji Kashamu in his lifetime used the maneuver of law and politics to escape from facing justice on alleged criminal offence in Nigeria and outside Nigeria. “But no legal, political, cultural, social, or even medical maneuver could stop the cold hand of death when the Creator of all of us decides that the time is up. “May Allah forgive his sin and accept his soul into Aljanah, and may God grant his family and friends fortitude to bear the irreparable loss,” he said.

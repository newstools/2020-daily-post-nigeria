Brazil legend, Ronaldo de Lima, has advised his former club, Real Madrid to sign Kylian Mbappe instead of his Paris Saint-Germain team-mate, Neymar. The two PSG attackers will be in action on Sunday night in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich. Both Neymar and Mbappe have been linked with move to Madrid in the past and the speculations are beginning to pop up again this summer. Speaking in a webinar hosted by Santander, Ronaldo urged Madrid to target Mbappe above Neymar. “Right now, it is not that one is better than another, but if Real Madrid had to make a big investment, they should do so thinking about the future,” he said. “Neymar is 28 years old and Mbappe is 22. As an investment, it would be more logical to bring the younger [of the two].”

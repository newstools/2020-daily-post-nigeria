President Muhammadu Buhari, has reacted to the appointment of Nigerian-born Kaycee Madu as a Minister in Canada. A statement to DAILY POST on Thursday signed by Femi Adesina said that the President rejoices with Madu, who was appointed Minister of Justice and Solicitor-General for the Government of Alberta, in Canada. Madu made history when he became the first African born provincial Minister in Canadian history, and is also the Provincial Secretary and Keeper of the Great Seal of the Province of Alberta. President Buhari described the honour as “landmark and historic,” saying it once again presents people of Nigerian descent as go-getters, who distinguish themselves in different walks of life. The President said that, “as the first Black Justice Minister and Solicitor-General in Canada, Madu has written himself into history books,” urging Nigerians, both at home and abroad, to remain good Ambassadors of their country.

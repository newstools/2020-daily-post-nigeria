Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya has told Erica what to do about Vee. Ebuka Obi-Uchendu on Sunday confronted Vee about her advice to Laycon to avoid Erica and stop talking to her in order to move on. After the live eviction, Erica took offence at Vee’s advice and vowed not to talk to her anymore. However, Kiddwaya advised his love interest not to ignore Vee but give her good energy. “I don’t trust anybody because I know they are all pretentious but the advice Vee gave Laycon was not from a malicious place. “It’s a game I’m enjoying myself. I have a great woman. “I just take this as an opportunity to meet with amazing people and this platform. A lot of people applied to be here but did not get in. “You don’t need to keep malice with Vee, talk to her. Do you know how it will make her feel to see someone she talked about giving her good energy? “But for Laycon just let him be.” Erica, responding, said she had freed Laycon and does not want to have anything to do with him.

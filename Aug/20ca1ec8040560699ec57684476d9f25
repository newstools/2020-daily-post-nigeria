Man United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has kept the ‘promise’ he made in March to the club’s forward, Tahith Chong. Chong is expected to join German side Werder Bremen on a two-season loan from Man United this summer. He recently rejected interest from several clubs across Europe to extend his contract at Man United until 2022. The 20-year-old is rated high at Old Trafford but has found opportunities difficult to come by. The Dutch youngster made just 12 first-team appearances during this season. However, Solskjaer then promised Chong in March that he would be permitted to leave Old Trafford on loan so as to aid his development, according to Chong’s agent, Erkan Alkan. “Mr Solskjaer kept his promise from March and told Tahith that he could leave the club,” Alkan told Bild. “The boy really wants to go to Werder. He wants to be part of the preparation as soon as possible so that he can quickly find his way around.”

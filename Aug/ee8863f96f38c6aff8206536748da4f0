His death is a big loss to Lagos and Epe town. Lagos APC and members of the progressive family across the country will deeply miss him. “I mourn with his wife and children and the entire Rasaq family. May Almighty Allah give them the strength to live after their father and patriarch. “I commiserate with Governor Babajide Sanwo-olu, the government and people of the state, particularly the entire people of Epe for the loss of an illustrious son. “May Almighty Allah forgive the late politician of his shortcomings, reward his good deeds and grant him Aljanna Fridaus.

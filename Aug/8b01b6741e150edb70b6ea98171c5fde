Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has commented on the performances of his two new signings, Timo Werner and Hakim Ziyech following his side’s friendly 1-1 draw with Brighton on Saturday. Lampard said Werner was sharp and bright during the encounter against Brighton, while Ziyech’s contributions and passing were great. Recall that Lampard’s side failed to beat Brighton at the Falmer Stadium after two goals from Werner and Pascal Grob. “I thought Timo was really sharp and bright,” Lampard was quoted by Chelsea’s official website as saying after the game. “He got his goal really early in the game. He showed some of the qualities that I know very well he has, so I’m very excited about having him in the squad. “I thought his work rate and everything about him was a great little start for him and Hakim Ziyech the same, some of his contributions and passing and quality levels were great. “In their performances, they were both really good.” Werner and Ziyech joined Chelsea this summer from RB Leipzig and Ajax respectively.

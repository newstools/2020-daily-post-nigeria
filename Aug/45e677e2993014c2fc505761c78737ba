Last Saturday, Arsenal finished the 2019/2020 campaign with silverware, after beating Chelsea 2-1 in the FA Cup final. It will see the Gunners earn a total of £3.6 million prize money, excluding the money earned for victories in earlier rounds. They will also earn £2.6 million just for entering the Europa League group stage. Arsenal expect to get a further £7.5million of gate receipts expected, if their fans are able to enter the Emirates for those three Europa League group games. Aside from the guaranteed money, Mikel Arteta’s men could earn a further £900k for each win in the group stage, giving them a maximum income of £5.4m in additional revenue. The Gunners will also be paid a £900k bonus for topping the group, £450k for reaching the Round of 32, £990k for reaching the Round of 16 and £1.3m for playing in the quarter-finals. These payments increase to £2.1m for the semi-finals with the winners netting a cool £7.6 million. That means Arsenal have a potential of £41m of Europa League earnings. Some of that money will be redirected to players in the form of bonuses and a reduction in the 12.5% pay cut they previously agreed.

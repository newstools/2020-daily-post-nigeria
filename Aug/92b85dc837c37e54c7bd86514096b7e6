When asked of the male housemate she has feelings for, Wathoni said Praise. “The first day I saw you, I thought you were cute with your earrings and love the way you dance. “I like you. “Loved your humor and I may just have feelings for you but you’re in a mix outside the house.” Recall that Praise had also told Kiddwaya that he really likes Wathoni.

Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has warned the Red Devils against complacency ahead of their Europa League quarter-final clash with Copenhagen on Monday night. Ferdinand also expects Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side to defeat Copenhagen at RheinEnergieSTADION in Germany. The Red Devils qualified for the last-8 after eliminating LASK from the Europa League last week. Speaking on BT Sport, Ferdinand said: “I fancy Man United to go through but like me and [Darren] Fletcher experienced, if your head’s not on it and you’re expecting to win easily, you can very much come a cropper. He added: “The attacking players than Man United have got compared to the players that Celtic have got, it’s a big difference. “I’d be surprised if they [Copenhagen] left two up because in today’s game you very rarely see that – so maybe one up with one behind. “To have two up in today’s game against a team like Manchester United with what they’ve been doing since we had the break I think would be very, very brave of Copenhagen but I wouldn’t put it past them.”

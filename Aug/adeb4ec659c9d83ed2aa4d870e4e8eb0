The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has withdrawn its invitation to the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir el-Rufai, following protests from some lawyers. This was revealed in a tweet via the NBA’s handle on Thursday. It read: “The National Executive Committee of the Nigerian Bar Association at its ongoing meeting resolves that the invitation to the Kaduna State Governor, H.E. Nasir El-Rufai, by the 2020 Annual General Conference Planning committee be withdrawn and decision communicated to the Governor.” El-Rufai was billed to be one of the speakers at the NBA Conference scheduled for August 26 – 29, 2020. However, his inclusion led to outrage and backlash, even on social media. Nigerians and lawyers cited his comments on Southern Kaduna killings, alleged disdain for court orders, among others.

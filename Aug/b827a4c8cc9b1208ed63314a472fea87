The Kaduna State High Court has fixed Tuesday, September 29 for judgement on the motion by Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, leader of the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN. Zakzaky in his motion prayed the court to dismiss the case against him and his wife by the government. The IMN leader anchored his plea over the government’s inability to produce evidence against them. El-Zakzaky’s counsel, Femi Falana in his argument on Friday urged the court to dismiss the charges against his clients because they lacked merit. Arguing that the charges won’t stand before any court of law, Falana stressed that the charges are also an abuse of court process. Represented by Abubakar Marshall, Falana asked the court to quash the charges against El-Zakzaky by the government for not “disclosing an offence known to law contrary to Section 36 (8) and (12) of the 1999 constitution as amended.” After listening to his arguments and that of the prosecution, the Presiding Judge, Justice Gideon Kurada adjourned the matter for ruling.

The provost, Imo College of Nursing and Midwifery Okporo Orlu in Imo State, Ngozi Duru may face a sack if the recent revelations about the institution are anything to go by. The state Commissioner for Education, Prof. B. T. O Ikegwuoha who visited the school on Thursday revealed that students in the institution are currently tasked over 400,000 naira for a session, a development he described as outright extortion of the students. According to the commissioner, the institution had since commenced academic activities without authorization of the state ministry of Education and against the COVID-19 directives as earlier given by the state government. He said, “the students have been levied all manner of materials like antiseptic and disinfectants, among other things. They imposed different fees on the students at exorbitant rates. This is unacceptable.” DAILY POST gathered that the provost allegedly disappeared into the thin air on hearing that the commissioner was on his way to inspect the institution. Meanwhile, the Commissioner has summoned the school bursar to his office to provide all the schedule of fees paid in recent times. All efforts to reach the provost by our state correspondent has proven abortive.

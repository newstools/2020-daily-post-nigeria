The All Progressives Congress (APC) has spoken on President Muhammadu Buhari’s constitution of the Executive/Legislative/All Progressives Congress (APC) Consultative Committee. The team was inaugurated on Monday at the State House, Abuja. APC said the development was to ensure good governance and accelerate the implementation of the Next Level agenda. The ruling party expressed confidence that the team would help speed up work on the nine priority areas Buhari announced last week. APC spokesman, Yekini Nabena, in a statement noted that all hands are now on deck to ensure the government’s success. He said administration was keen on improving security, education, health care, the economy, job creation, social inclusion, infrastructure, among others. Nabena noted that the calibre of personalities on the committee speaks to the President’s seriousness to ensure synergy and functional relations between the executive, legislature and the APC. “Nigerians are the ultimate beneficiaries as this will translate to the delivery of dividends of democracy and fast track the implementation of the administration’s policies and programmes that will positively and directly improve a lot of citizens”, he added.

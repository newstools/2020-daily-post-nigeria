Arsenal midfielder, Mesut Ozil, has spoken on the massive explosion that rocked Beirut, the capital city of Lebanon on Tuesday. DAILY POST recalls that more than 50 people were feared dead, with nearly 3,000 injured following the explosion. Lebanon’s Interior Minister, Mohammed Fahmi, says the Tuesday explosion in Beirut was caused by ammonium nitrate. Fahmi said the chemical was stored in a warehouse at the port. Also, Prime Minister, Hassan Diab, disclosed that the warehouse had been the subject of warnings since 2014. Diab assured that he would “reveal facts” about the facility soon. Reacting to the development, Ozil, in a tweet on his official Twitter account on Wednesday, said he was still in shock. He also urged the people of Lebanon to be strong and keep hope. “Still in shock. My support & love to the #Beirutis and #Lebanese,” Ozil tweeted. “This is really hard, but I know you’re strong and you will rise again. Keep hope.”<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-825063" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ozil.jpg" alt="" width="594" height="424" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ozil.jpg 594w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ozil-300x214.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px">

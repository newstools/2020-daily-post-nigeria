Big Brother Naija housemate, Brighto, has explained why he voted for Trickytee and Praise to be evicted from the reality show. Housemates were to vote out the housemates of their choice among the four with the least votes, Trickytee, Vee, Praise and Wathoni. Speaking during his diary session on Monday, Brighto told Biggie that he picked Trikytee up for eviction because he has been picking for a while. According to him, he picked Praise up for eviction because he started seeing some attitude in him that he doesn’t like. Praise was the sixth and only housemate evicted on Sunday. Brighto said: “I voted Trikytee and Praise. When it comes to voting, I don’t attach emotions. “I chose Trikytee because I have been picking him for a while. “For Praise, I started seeing some attitude in him that I don’t like. “Praise has a way of talking to people in a manner that is not good. I think he is a bully.”

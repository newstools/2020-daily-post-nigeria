The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has confirmed it would disburse $2million to clubs and leagues in the country, to cushion the financial effects of COVID-19. “After consultations with the leadership of the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Board endorsed the proposal from the secretariat for the lump sum of $2 million only to be shared across the various football clubs and governing bodies of the various Leagues,” a statement on Tuesday read. The relief fund is made up of $1million from FIFA’s support for restarting the football season, $500,0000 from the world football governing body’s grant for women’s football, $300,000 of CAF support to member associations and $200,000 from sponsors of the Nigerian FA. The leagues that would benefit are the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL), Nigeria National League (NNL), Nigeria Women’s Football League (NWFL) and the Nigeria Nationwide League (NNL). The NPFL was suspended in March because of the pandemic. Football is yet to resume in Nigeria, but the new season is tentatively scheduled to start by October.

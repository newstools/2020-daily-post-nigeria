Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemates, Erica and Laycon were caught on camera last night hugging passionately and sharing kisses. This happened just a few hours after Kiddwaya and Erica, long term partners in the house, broke up. Laycon was heard telling Erica, “I’m sorry.” When she asked why he was sorry, he replied, “I don’t know but I’m sorry,” as they continued holding each other tightly. Laycon had always expressed his love for Erica and sees himself as the best man for her. People thought he had given up what was seen as a wild goose chase before now, but it seems hopes have returned following yesterday’s development. Recall that Erica had recently berated Laycon for gossiping about her with the others. This was after Laycon was pained by Erica’s rejection as the Abia-born female housemate picked Kiddwaya over him. Erica had once made it clear that while she is mentally attracted to Laycon, she is physically attracted to her lover, Kiddwaya.

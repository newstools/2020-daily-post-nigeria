Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire, has been given a suspended prison sentence of 21 months and 10 days by a Greek court, after being found guilty of aggravated assault, resisting arrest and repeated attempts of bribery. The sentence will be suspended because it is Maguire’s first offence and charges were misdemeanours. However, the England defender’s legal team have said they will appeal the verdict. Maguire was convicted of all the charges against him by a court on the island of Syros. He was arrested with his brother and a friend, after a fight broke out while he was on holiday in Mykonos, over claims his sister was injected with a suspected “rape drug”. Maguire said: “Following the hearing today, I have instructed my legal team with immediate effect to inform the courts we will be appealing. “I remain strong and confident regarding our innocence in this matter – if anything myself, family and friends are the victims.”

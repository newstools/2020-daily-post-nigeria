No fewer than 29 new traditional rulers have been presented Staff of Office by Abia State Governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu. Ikpeazu charged them to stop any act that will slow the growth or interest of their immediate communities and local government areas. The event took place at the Michael Okpara Auditorium of Government House, Umuahia. Presenting the Staff of Office, the Governor stated that the Ezeship stool represents the fourth tier of government and urged them to serve in their various communities as custodians of the culture and traditions of the people. He also charged them to take responsibility for the security and economic development of their immediate communities. “It is your duty to bring to government’s knowledge anything that will improve lives of the people”. Ikpeazu, while encouraging them to join forces with the government in sensitising the people and ensuring they implement the relevant COVID-19 protocols warned against subversive acts that are capable of tarnishing the traditional institutions and create clogs in the State’s wheel of progress. The governor called for complete alignment with the principles, development agenda and policies of the government of the day. Also speaking at the event, the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Chief G. C. Onyendilefu, said that the event marks the end of a painstaking journey of electing Traditional Rulers in their various communities. Onyendilefu, however, urged them to live in peace and harmony with members of their communities and work in tandem with the state government policies.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Sunday revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari has cautioned party leaders on the Edo election. The governorship poll will be held on September 19. APC spokesman, Yekini Nabena, disclosed that Buhari warned officials to avoid a repeat of what happened in Bayelsa, Rivers and Zamfara States. In Bayelsa, the Supreme Court handed victory to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) after it ruled that deputy governor-elect, Biobarakuma Degi-Eremienyo, presented a forged certificate. In Zamfara, the apex court declared PDP winner even though the APC won majority votes. It adjudged that the APC failed to submit the name of its flagbearer within the stipulated time, a consequence of dual primaries conducted by opposing factions. In a statement, Nabena said the president charged the APC leadership to win the election “using all legal and constitutional means by avoiding the pitfalls that affected the party’s victory in Rivers, Zamfara and Bayelsa states during and after the 2019 elections.” The party thanked supporters for their presence during Saturday’s campaign flagoff for its candidate Osagie Ize-Iyamu and running mate, Gani Audu. Nabena noted that the electorate “have sent a clear message on the governance direction of the state – a progressive one which puts the people’s welfare and interests first.” He added that going forward, “the task before us is to collectively showcase our evident people-focused development records to the good people of Edo state.”

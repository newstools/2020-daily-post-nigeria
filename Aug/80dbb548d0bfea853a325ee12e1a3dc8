Senator Shehu Sani has condemned the use of force against members of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, and the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN. Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th Assembly said instead of attacking unarmed people, the government should use its power against terrorists and bandits operating and causing mayhem in different parts of the country DAILY POST reported yesterday that an unknown number of members of the IPOB were killed in Enugu when they clashed with security operatives. Policemen had stormed a Community Secondary School, Emene where members of IPOB were meeting. But an attempt to arrest the IPOB members was resisted leading to a face-off. Earlier on Monday, the IMN alleged that some policemen shot dead three of its members in Kaduna The group alleged that three Shi’ite members were attacked and killed by the combined team of armed police officers and thugs Reacting to the development, Shehu Sani tweeted, “No matter how much the ideas and beliefs of the members of the IMN and IPOB differ with ours, the use of state violence or support for the use of state violence to suppress their rallies or procession is unconscionable. We have terrorists that deserve the force of our arms and anger.”

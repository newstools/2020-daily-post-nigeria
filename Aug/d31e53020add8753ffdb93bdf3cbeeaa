Manchester United midfielder, Bruno Fernandes is now the leading goal scorer so far in the Europa League with seven goals (five with Sporting Lisbon, two with Man United). The Portugal international scored the only goal in Man United’s 1-0 victory over Copenhagen after 120minutes in the last-8 final tie on Monday night to qualify Man United to the semi-final, where they will face the winner between Wolves and Sevilla. Since the beginning of the 2019/20 Europa League, Fernandes has had a direct hand in 21 goals (13 goals, eight assists) in the tournament – more than any other player this term. Meanwhile, Inter Milan striker, Romelu Lukaku, broke two Europa League records after scoring a goal in his side’s 2-1 victory over Bayer Leverkusen in the last-8 final tie on Monday night. Lukaku’s goal against Leverkusen means the former Manchester United and Chelsea striker has now scored in 9 consecutive appearances in the Europa League dating back to 2014, according to ESPN. It is also the longest goal-scoring run by a single player in Europa League history, breaking a tie with Newcastle United Legend, Alan Shearer (8).

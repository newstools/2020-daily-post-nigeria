The People Democratic Party, PDP in Edo State has urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the Inspector General of Police to call the campaign team of the All Progressive Congress, APC to order. A former Speaker of the state house of assembly, Rt. Hon. Kabiru Adjoto while briefing newsmen at the state NUJ secretariat alleged that over 15 persons suffered several degrees of gunshot wounds inflicted by APC thugs. He alleged that the thugs attacked some PDP supporters at Ekpe Public field in Akoko-Edo local government area while they were having their meeting. According to him, the IGP should set up a crack team to visit Akoko-Edo and investigate the matter. ”A governor can only govern the living and not the dead, politics is not a do or die affair, one person must emerge”. He said ‘I know very well that President Buhari wants peace for Edo and Nigeria. What I saw after the incident is very bad, this is not healthy for democracy. ‘Obaseki has worked, he likes Edo and the people like him, Oshiomole should allow peace to reign not taking sides or instigating violence, he should be an elder statesman by now. Prince Kayode Ogunnubi, PDP, chairman, Akoko-Edo noted the target of the gunmen was to get rid of the people putting on a branded face cap with Gov Godwin. He stressed that there is need for the APC to put on hold all future campaign plans in the area until tension subsides, else the people will be forced to resist and defend themselves of such ugly scenario ever played out again. ‘The attacks carried out by these gunmen are evil and condemnable and we will not sit back and watch the opposition ruin the tranquillity that we enjoy in Akoko-Edo he added. When contacted, the spokesperson for the Edo State APC campaign council, John Mayaki told DAILY POST that he has resorted not to respond to lies from all corners.

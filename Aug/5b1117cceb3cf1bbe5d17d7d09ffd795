Former Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Ka3na has reacted to report of having sex with fellow housemate, Praise. A video had emerged last week of the duo having sex before Ka3na was evicted from the reality show. However, Ka3na insisted that they never had sex in the house. Speaking with Beats FM, the mother of three said they were only cuddling aggressively. “There was no sexual intercourse whatsoever. You saw what you saw on the screen, but I was live in the house, and yeah, nothing happened,” she said.

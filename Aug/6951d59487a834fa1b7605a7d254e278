United States President Donald Trump has urged more universities to reopen. Noting that COVID-19 is very dangerous for older people, Trump said youths are less at risk. “For university students, the likelihood of severe illness is less than or equal to the risk of a seasonal flu,” CNBC quoted Trump as saying. He said instead of saving lives, the decision to close universities could cost lives. “It is significantly safer for students to live with other young people than to go home and spread the virus to older Americans,” Trump said. Some universities are rethinking their plans to reopen after several outbreaks emerged shortly after students returned to campus. America has recorded more than 5.7million COVID-19 cases and 177,000 deaths. Globally, coronavirus has claimed nearly 800,000 lives since its outbreak in China last 2019.

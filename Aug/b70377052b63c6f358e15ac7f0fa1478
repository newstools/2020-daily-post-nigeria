Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Praise, has identified the housemate with a strategy to win the season’s N85m worth of prize. Praise who was evicted on Sunday told Ebuka in his post-eviction interview, that Brighto had the best strategy. Praise said Brighto is difficult to figure out as he changes his behavior daily. He noted that Brighto was pretending. ”I think the person with a strategy is Brighto. I kept on saying I haven’t figured out who he is. I think I have figured out everyone in the house but Brighto is different. ”I fear for my friend, Dorathy because she likes him. I don’t know what is going on between Brighto and Wathoni but where I figured out something had gone down between them was when she sent a secret message to him during one of our conversations. ”I think Brighto is pretending and I think his strategy is working for him. I only started figuring him out when you asked that question on Sunday.” Recall that on Sunday, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, had called out Brighto to clarify his statement, that Neo was fake and pretentious but the Edo-born denied saying it. After several attempts to get Brighto to say the truth, Ebuka noted that Brighto wanted to chicken out.

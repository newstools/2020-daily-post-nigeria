Jadon Sancho will become one of the highest-paid players in the Premier League, when he completes a move to Manchester United, according to the UK Sun. Sancho is very close to a return to England, after agreeing personal terms with the Red Devils. The 20-year-old has a five-year deal offer from United, that will see him earn £220,000 a week at Old Trafford. The only sticking point to the transfer, is both clubs agreeing a fee for the player. Dortmund have stood firm over their £108m valuation of the former Manchester City winger. United are now looking to structure payment over a few years and reach an agreement before August 10, when the Bundesliga team travel to their Swiss pre-season training camp.

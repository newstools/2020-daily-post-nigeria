United States President Donald Trump has chided Michelle Obama for her comments as she praised Democratic candidate Joe Biden. On Monday, Michelle addressed the opening night of the Democratic National Convention. In her speech, the former first lady said Trump was a leader dangerously deficient in empathy and experience. “If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden as our lives depend on it”, she said. On Tuesday, Trump condemned the description of his character and leadership. The American leader stated that he would not be in the White House if Michelle’s husband, Barack Obama, performed well in office. He tweeted: “Somebody please explain to @MichelleObama that Donald J. Trump would not be here, in the beautiful White House, if it weren’t for the job done by your husband, Barack Obama.” The president declared that Biden was merely “an afterthought and enthusiastic endorsement.” Trump said he and his administration built the greatest economy in history and saved millions of lives. “Jobs are flowing, NASDAQ is already at a record high, the rest to follow. Sit back & watch!”, he added.

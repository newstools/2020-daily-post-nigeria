The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has condemned the invasion of Edo State House of Assembly. Its reaction was contained in a statement on Sunday by the chairman, Kingsley Chinda. The caucus indicted Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu. After the hullabaloo, Malami directed IGP Adamu to provide security for the 17 APC lawmakers. “As highest ranking law officers, they should be seen to keep peace and order and not otherwise”, the PDP body noted. It also blamed the All Progressives Congress (APC), its former chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and his supporters. The caucus accused them of attempting to unleash mayhem on Edo people in a bid to take over governance. It likened the development to military days and warned that it could cause the collapse of democracy. The lawmakers advised the federal government to exhibit maturity, candour and a true sense of responsibility. They warned of actions that could instigate electoral violence ahead of and during the September 19 governorship election. The legislators urged Governor Godwin Obaseki and Edo people to resist moves to cause a crisis in the state. They told President Muhammadu Buhari “to live above partisan interest and for once be for everybody and defend the constitution of Nigeria”. The statement said the attempt “to impeach Speaker Frank Okiye through the back door was not only a clear case of the desecration of the institution of the legislature, but also an affront on the people of Edo State and indeed Nigerians.”

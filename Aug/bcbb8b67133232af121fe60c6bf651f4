Manchester United forward, Tahith Chong, has left the club to join German side Werder Bremen. Werder Bremen disclosed this in a tweet via its official Twitter page on Sunday. It said: “@TahithC changes to SV for one year #Werder. Welcome to the green and white family, Tahith!” DAILY POST recalls that Chong recently rejected interest from several clubs across Europe to extend his contract at Man United until 2022. Chong is rated high at Man United but has found opportunities difficult to come by. The 20-year-old made just 12 first-team appearances during this 2019/20 season. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-829525 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/man-utd-forward.jpg" alt="" width="608" height="476" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/man-utd-forward.jpg 608w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/man-utd-forward-300x235.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 608px) 100vw, 608px">

The Enugu Capital Territory Development Authority, ECTDA, has offered clarification on the twin duplex demolished by the agency at the Eziokwe Street, Nike Lake Area of the State. It said the property, which belongs to one Arch. John Emejulu was demolished by the agency on Friday in compliance with a valid court order, having been found to have been erected on waterway, which posed health risk. Emejulu has been in the news after he destroyed the perimeter fence of the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu. Executive Director and chairman of ECTDA, Mr. Ken Onoh, who spoke on the development, Saturday, said the building was brought down owing to a valid court order and not any form of reprisal. A court order sighted by our correspondent showed that the building was demolished for contravening health safety as it was erected on waterways and had to give way. Onoh re-echoed the agency’s stand that “the property situated along Eziokwe Street, off Nike Lake road, Enugu, stood on a water way, needed to give way for public safety and was demolished in compliance with a valid court order after it was duly served on the occupant of the house.” He urged the public to ignore claims that the demolition was any form of reprisal. Meanwhile, further enquiries revealed that the building’s marking for demolition predated the destruction of the Enugu Airport fence as it showed July 8,2020, which is nearly one month before the airport fence was brought down.

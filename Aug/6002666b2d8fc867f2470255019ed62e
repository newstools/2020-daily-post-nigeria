The Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, Effurun branch in Delta State, on Thursday, vowed to challenge in court, the new Company and Allied Matters 2020 Act, CAMA, signed by President Muhammadu Buhari on August 7. The NBA President in Effurun, Mr. Jonathan Ekperusi Esqmade, made the vow during a remark when he led members of the legal profession on a courtesy visit to the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Warri Correspondents’ Chapel. The legal practitioner said the CAMA 2020 Act was smuggled into the law establishing the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, through the backdoor. Ekperusi, who was flanked by Mrs. K.P.I. Bello, Kingsley. O. Idisi Esq, Prosper Oke Akpoveta Esq, Oghenetega Ikpen Esq and others, said part “C” which is controversial provision of the CAMA law gives the Registrar -General of the Corporate Affairs Commission, CAC, the power to strictly regulate religious bodies including Islamic groups as well as charity organizations and their existence. According to him, the Registrar-General has the powers to suspend trustees of an association or a religious body and appoint an interim manager or managers to coordinate its affairs without recourse to a court of law. This he said is “violence” of the fair hearing provisions of the Constitution of Nigeria. He said, “That’s too draconian. CAC does not need the court again. They’re now the prosecutor and the judge. No sane society should allow that to happen. That cannot stand. NBA will challenge that obnoxious law. It is for the ease of doing business. They use the provisions of part “A”,” B”&”C”. While noting that there is a time bomb in part “C” of the CAMA Act 2020, Ekperusi said, “We will approach the Court. Those sections will be struck out,” he assured.

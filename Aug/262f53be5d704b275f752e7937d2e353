The Federal Government has disclosed that it is working hard to ensure that Nigerians have access to the COVID-19 vaccines when available. The Chairman of the PTF, Mr. Boss Mustapha, stated this at the daily briefing of the Task Force on Thursday in Abuja. Speaking on Nigeria’s preparation for a vaccine, Mustapha noted that, “globally, the world continues to pursue the search for a vaccine with over one thousand trials ongoing and different claims of levels of success. “We note particularly the announcement by the President of Russia on the breakthrough in the development of a vaccine even as we study the developments. “Fighting the pandemic successfully will take a global effort, and Nigeria will not be left out whenever and wherever progress is made. “However, the health and safety of Nigerians will always remain our priority in the pursuit of a solution,” he said

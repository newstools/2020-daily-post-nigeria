The Kwara State Government on Monday, directed Senior Secondary School students, SS3, to resume academic activities on Wednesday, August 5, 2020. The State Commissioner for Education and Human Capital Development, Hajia Fatimah Ahmed, announced during the official presentation of protective kits to the ministry by the state deputy governor, Mr. Kayode Alabi on Monday, ahead of Wednesday’s resumption of students preparing for the senior secondary school certificate examinations. Alabi directed the ministry to ensure that the protective kits reach all the students that will resume on Wednesday. “This is the first phase as we are also giving out sanitizers, while the Ministry of Education working with the state Covid-19 technical committee and stakeholders in the sector, has been mandated to ensure that safety rules are adhered to,” the deputy governor stated. The commissioner also urged All Nigeria Confederation of Principals, ANCOPSS, to ensure that both teachers and students observe the rules and regulations of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, in order to avoid casualties in schools. According to her, “Monitoring teams from the ministry and its agencies will be going round for inspection,” adding that ” only the SS3 students are to resume on Wednesday for now.” The government, she warned, “would not hesitate to discipline any school official that attempts to endanger the lives of the students.” She said, “Our SS3 students will resume this week, precisely on Wednesday. We have 65,000 face masks here which will be distributed to schools across the three senatorial districts of the state.” ANCOPSS president, Alhaji Toyin Abdullahi, commended the state government for providing protective kits to schools in the state, assuring of even distribution of the kits to all schools. The provision of the kits are part of the government’s efforts to flatten the curve of Covid-19 infection transmission in the state.

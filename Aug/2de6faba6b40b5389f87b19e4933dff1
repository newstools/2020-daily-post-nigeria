Bayern Munich Chairman, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, has paid tribute to Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, ahead of both sides’ Champions League last-8 final tie on Friday. Bayern head to the game after eliminating Chelsea in the round of 16 encounter last week, while Barcelona knocked out Napoli. But Rummenigge has now expressed his big admiration for Messi, adding that the Argentine captain has something that possibly no other footballer has on this planet. He also said that he has huge respect for the 33-year-old because he can decide a game on his own. “I have huge respect for this player [Lionel Messi]. He has something that probably no one else on this planet has,” Rummenigge told Munich-based daily TZ. “He can decide a football game on his own. He proved that again last Saturday against Napoli.” He added: “He is a player who wants to have fun with football. If you take a little of that fun away from him by trying to take him out of the game tactically, then there is a good chance for Bayern Munich.” Bayern Munich and Barcelona have each won the Champions League five times.

The monarch spoke during the Governor’s visit to his palace during the PDP campaign in the area on Tuesday. He said, “Mr. Governor, we are assuring you that you are at home. This community road has been a disaster for over a thousand years until your intervention. “We were cut off from Edo State until you gave us a good road that integrated us back as members of the state. We cannot forget such a gesture.” According to him, governments come and go and do not remember that humans exist in the area, adding Obaseki came and connected them back to the state through good roads. He said that he and his people stand anywhere Obaseki/Shaibu stand.

UEFA President, Aleksander Ceferin, has said the single-game knockout format which was used in the Champions League this year from the quarter-final stage, could be continued in future. The format was introduced to allow the competition to be completed in a shorter span, after COVID-19 halted football for several months. Eight clubs headed to Lisbon and Bayern Munich will meet Paris Saint-Germain in the final on Sunday. “We were forced to do it but in the end, we see that we found out something new,” Ceferin told Reuters. “So we will think about it in the future for sure.” Ceferin noted that without a second leg to play, teams have been forced to go for goals. However, the current two-legged format is locked in place contractually until 2024/2025, but discussions are due to begin later this year on the structure for the competition for the next phase.

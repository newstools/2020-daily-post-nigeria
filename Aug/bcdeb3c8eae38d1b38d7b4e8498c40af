The Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital (UITH) on Wednesday said it was not embarking on strike. The association in a statement signed by the president, Dr Lanre Olosunde, described the report of a planned strike as false and misleading, NAN reports. Olosunde said the association remained committed to its service to humanity, adding that ARD was mindful of the health of Nigerians. “With the erroneous representation of facts and perceived misinformation of the public by a broadcast media on Aug. 25 on the unfortunate demise of Mr Olusola Olagunju, a patient that was alleged to have died from Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) strike, we are compelled to set the records straight. ”The Association of Resident Doctors in UITH, Ilorin, was not on strike when the unfortunate incident happened.
“We don’t operate nor have any access to the control of the electricity supply to the hospital and equipment and we never chased nurses out while carrying out their duties. “We use this medium to reiterate, as a matter of public enlightenment and orientation, that dissatisfied clients, patients and relatives of the hospital can always approach the SERVICOM unit to register their displeasure. He appealed to the public to disregard the report of a planned strike, saying it did not represent an account of what happened nor did it in any way represent the ideals of the association. “We state unequivocally that our members remain committed to their statutory responsibilities of always delivering quality healthcare service to the good citizens of Nigeria and Kwara state in particular,” he added.

The United States is vexed about the rejection of its proposal on Iran to the United Nations. The proposal sought indefinite extension of an arms embargo on Iran. At the UN Security Council meeting on Friday, China and Russia, two veto power holders in the 15-member council, voted against the US-sponsored resolution. Eleven countries, including the United Kingdom, France and Germany, abstained. U.S. Permanent Representative to the UN, Kelly Craft, said her country would stop at nothing to extend the arms embargo. Reacting, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, described the council’s decision as “inexcusable’’. The official declared that the UN failed in its primary responsibility of maintaining international peace and security. Pompeo said in rejecting “a reasonable resolution to extend the 13-year old arms embargo on Iran”, the UN has “paved the way for the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism to buy and sell conventional weapons.” “The Security Council’s failure to act decisively in defense of international peace and security is inexcusable,’’ he added.

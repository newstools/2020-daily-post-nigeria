Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo on Friday night set a new Champions League record after his team were eliminated from the competition by Lyon. Juventus defeated Lyon 2-1 in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie in Turin, thanks to two goals from Cristiano Ronaldo, but Maurizio Sarri’s side lost 1-0 to the French Ligue 1 side in the first-leg back in February. Memphis Depay did score for Lyon at the Allianz Stadium. However, Lyon qualified for the quarter-final on an away goal rule after a 2-2 draw aggregate. According to OptaJoe, Ronaldo’s brace against Lyon means the Portugal captain has now scored 20 goals in his last 13 home Champions League knockout matches. In total, the former Real Madrid star has scored 67 goals in the knockout stages of the competition. The 35-year-old has 21 goals more than second place Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, who has 46 goals.

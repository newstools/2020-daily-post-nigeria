Crusoe Osagie, the Special Adviser to the Edo State Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, has said there is no clash between Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Philip Shaibu. Reports of a faceoff between the Governor and his deputy have been making the rounds. The clash, they said is caused because of campaign funds. But in a statement in Benin City, the state capital on Saturday, Osagie said the falsehood could only have emanated from the All Progressives Congress (APC). He accused the opposition APC to have adapted to spinning the rumour mill and concocting alternative facts to massage the egos of their paymasters. “The lie that there was a clash between the governor and his deputy should be dismissed in its entirety. Whatever incident they allude to only exists in the imagination of the purveyors,” the statement added. “There was indeed a meeting with key stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which ended with everyone in high spirits. “There was a spirit of cordiality and everyone shared their ideas and inputs on how to deliver the party in the September 19 governorship election.” Earlier on, Shaibu had said that speculations that he is on a warpath with Governor Godwin Obaseki are false. He also accused the former APC National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole “and his rejected son (Osagie) Ize-Iyamu” of conducting their political affairs in a primitive way. Shaibu’s spokesman, Benjamin Atu, in a statement on Saturday, said the “Machiavellian system of politics where all forms of wizardry tactics are deployed both through fair and foul means will certainly achieve the opposite result.” The deputy governor alerted that “mischievous elements sponsored by hopeless, helpless political jobbers and merchants” have been unleashed against him.

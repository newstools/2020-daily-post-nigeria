The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, says the country is ready to commence mass production of COVID-19 vaccine. He disclosed that work on three vaccines was ongoing. Reuters reports that Modi made the announcement in his Independence Day speech on Saturday. He said the government was only waiting for its scientists to give the go-ahead. Modi confirmed: “Not one, not two, as many as three coronavirus vaccines are being tested in India.” In a veil reference to border clashes with China, Modi declared that India’s sovereignty was supreme. “Anyone who has raised eyes on the sovereignty of the country, the army of the country have responded to them in the same language,’’ he said. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, only 4,000 guests were allowed to access the venue of the ceremony. They sat six feet apart, while medical booths with ambulances were set up for emergency.

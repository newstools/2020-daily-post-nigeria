As the October 10 governorship election in Ondo State gradually crawls in, the candidate of the major opposition party in the state, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Eyitayo Jegede, has warned that rigging will not be possible during the poll. According to Jegede, the plan to deploy mercenaries from other states with the aim of rigging the election will be resisted. The PDP candidate stated this on Monday while receiving no fewer than 100 decampees into the PDP fold in Iju/Itaogbolu, Akure North Local Government area of Ondo State. During the defection held at the inauguration of Akure North Inter-party Campaign Committee, Jegede said the purported mercenaries should “stop short at the state’s borders, as the people are determined to defend their right.” Meanwhile, those who defected to PDP were said to be from the All Progressives Congress (APC), the Social Democratic Party (SDP), and the Allied Congress Party of Nigeria (ACPN). Speaking for the defectors, a former candidate for the House of Assembly election for the ACPN, Mr Busuyi Alademehin, said, “We all resolved to join the PDP and mobilise all our supporters to vote for the party, principally because of the personality of Eyitayo Jegede. “Here is a man who has always been in touch with the common people, especially those at the grassroots; and we believe that if we elect him as our governor, he will do all within his powers to alleviate our suffering. Also, a former PDP chairman in the state, Chief Ebenezer Alabi, publicly denied a festering rumour that he had joined the deputy governor of the state, Mr. Agboola Ajayi, to defect to ZLP. “People should stop bearing tales about me without clarifying from me. “I remain a loyal PDP member. The fact that I worked for another candidate before the primary election doesn’t mean I must leave my party once my candidate could not win.”

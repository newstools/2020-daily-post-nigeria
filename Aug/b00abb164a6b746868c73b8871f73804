A Plant Physiologist, Dr Olufunmilayo Idowu, has advised Nigerians to eat mushrooms. The expert said the antioxidant content of mushrooms protects the human body against cancer. Idowu gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan on Monday. The National Horticultural Research Institute (NIHORT) official said some species of mushrooms have selenium and ergothioneine, antioxidants good for the body. She said oyster mushrooms contain agents which scavenge for free radicals in the body and bind with the agents to prevent them from causing unnecessary cell division. Idowu explained that the cell division could result in tumours, cancer and some other disease conditions. The scientist added that mushrooms lower blood pressure because of the high concentration of enzyme and statin. She explained that it prevents diabetes and heart-related issues due to zero cholesterol and low carbohydrate levels. Idowu confirmed that the edibles are high in quality protein, essential amino acids, vitamins and minerals. “Mushrooms are known for food and medicine; some are edible or medicinal while some are both edible and medicinal as well. “Government at all levels should harness the potentials of this socioeconomic commodity to create more jobs, improve the livelihood of farmers and the national economy by extension,” Idowu added.

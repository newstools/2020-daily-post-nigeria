The federal government has asked banks to open all their branches. Dr. Sani Aliyu, the National Coordinator of the Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19, stated this during Thursday’s media briefing. During the press conference, it was also announced that President Muhammadu Buhari has extended the eased lockdown by another four weeks. “We have said banks can fully resume. They no longer have to select the branches to open,” Aliyu said. He also made it clear that PTF does not recommend testing of students before they resume schools. Some schools are started reopening across the country this week.

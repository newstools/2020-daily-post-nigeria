Three people have drowned following a boat accident in Adamawa State. The three, two men and a woman, met their death along a river in Lamurde, a local government area on Adamawa’s border with Gombe State. Names of the deceased were given simply as Isaac G, James S, and Melody M. They, along with other passengers, were said to be on their way for a funeral ceremony when the boat conveying them capsized. Lamurde is a riverine community with a history of occasional flooding and water-related accidents. Confirming the incident, Chairman of Lamurde Local Government Area, Burto Williams, said Lamurde needs intervention urgently. “The accident is a tragedy that requires government to come to the aid of the people of the area who are constantly being ravaged by cascading water,” he said. He added, however, that his council was providing medical treatment for survivors of the boat accident, just as the council will foot the bill of the burial of the dead.

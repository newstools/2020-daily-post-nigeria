Two former Arsenal players, Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie, have reacted to the team’s 2-1 win over Chelsea in the FA Cup final on Saturday. The Gunners fought back from an early Christian Pulisic goal, to win their 14th FA Cup. Captain Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang equalized from the spot before the break, before scoring the winner in the second half. “Congratulations @Arsenal for winning the @FACupFinal For the 14th time. #remarkable,” Fabregas who also played for Chelsea tweeted. Former Arsenal skipper, Van Persie, wrote: “Congrats @Arsenal! Outstanding achievement to win this year’s #FACup. Class finish by @Aubameyang7 to get the win after another great team performance.” Mikel Arteta has now won a trophy in his first year as manager, while also qualifying the team for the Europa League.

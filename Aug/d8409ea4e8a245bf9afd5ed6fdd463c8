The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has warned that no one is safe in Nigeria. The President, Samson Ayokunle, spoke at the All Christians Fellowship Mission (ACFM) in Abuja on Sunday. He cited the security report that terrorist groups were infiltrating some parts of Nigeria’s North. The United States Africa Command (US AFRICOM) said the Islamic State and Al-Qaeda terrorist groups were gradually entering the West African region The CAN leader expressed concern, noting that the security situation in Nigeria was frightening already. He urged President Muhammadu Buhari’s government to immediately overhaul the country’s security apparatus. Ayokunle recalled that 14 members of a Baptist church in Kogi state were recently slaughtered overnight. “Nobody is safe. These radicals can attack from any angle. The people of this nation deserve to live their lives in maximum security”, NAN quoted him as saying. “The government has to up its game. No more excuses and no more sympathies for people that have died. We can’t allow more people to keep dying,” he added.

Malam Ibrahim explained that the affected people are now squatting with their relations and friends in Gusau, Kaura and many other places in the state. The district head appealed to Gusau Local Government Council and the state government to as a matter of urgency construct standard roads and drainages in the area to alleviate the plight of the people. He noted that the immediate past administration led by Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari awarded a contract of road construction and drainages in the area which was started but later abandoned by the contractor for the reason or reasons best known to him. “About 98 percent of the population in Gidan Kaura area are professional farmers and the uncontrollable flood has destroyed all the farmlands, which means that there would be serious shortage of food in the area this season,” he pointed out.

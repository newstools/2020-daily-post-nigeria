Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, on Sunday reacted to the formation of the Miyetti Allah security outfit across the nation. Kanu alleged that the formation of the security outfit was a plot by Fulanis to conquer Nigeria. The IPOB leader insisted that it was a move to further subdue Christians in Nigeria. In a statement he signed, Kanu said: “Now that Miyetti Allah (the sponsors of the 4th deadliest terrorist group in the world) has finally confirmed the long-running Fulani conquest agenda of entire Nigeria by forming a nationwide ‘security outfit’, the Indigenous of Biafra (IPOB) wishes to go on record to state as follows: “This latest belligerent development may have caught the rest of Nigeria by surprise but not the IPOB which had warned long ago that the Fulani has – since 2015 – hatched a plot to violently conquer the whole of Nigeria and is in this wise being overtly and covertly emboldened by the Fulanized, Islamized Federal Government of Nigeria. “This latest move is merely a part of series of actions geared to subjugating the Christian indigenous nationalities of Nigeria that have stoically borne the brunt of the brutal terror that was unleashed by the Fulani since the coming of Buhari in 2015. “This terror has largely affected the Christian minorities in Northern Nigeria but with this latest development, the Fulani now wants to bring this terror fully to Southern Nigeria through the subterfuge of a Fulani ‘security outfit’. “If Miyetti Allah’s intentions are sincere and patriotic, it would have advisedly restricted this so-called security outfit to the FEW States in the far North where they are pseudo-indigenes, having settled-in after migrating to Northern Nigeria from Futa Jallon. To be sure, the Yoruba – through the OPC – founded Amotekun and ensured that it remains a strictly regional security outfit that is restricted to the Southwest of Nigeria.”

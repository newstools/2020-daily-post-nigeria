The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has warned the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to shelve any ambition he may be nursing for the 2023 presidency and rather focus on his health. Although the APC leader has not made his intentions for 2023 public, there are wide speculations that he is warming up to replace President Muhammadu Buhari when his tenure expires in three years time. Primate Ayodele warned that Tinubu should focus and pray for his health not to crumble before 2023. Primate Ayodele, who earlier prophesied that Tinubu will be betrayed by the presidency further noted that Buhari won’t give enough support to the ex-Lagos Governor to realise his presidential ambition. ‘‘Tinubu should take care of his health before his ambition for President, his health might crumble, who says his health will still be standing by 2023. He has not done the right thing. “Also, Buhari will dump Tinubu, he won’t support his course, Buhari won’t give enough moral and physical support’’ he said in a statement to DAILY POST on Wednesday.

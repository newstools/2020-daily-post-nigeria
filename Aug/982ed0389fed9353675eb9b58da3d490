Former Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Leo Dasilva has reacted to the sex escapade between Erica and Kiddwaya. Erica and Kiddwaya were on Sunday night seen on national television having sex under the duvet. Her action has since stirred reactions from fans as some described her as a lady without self control despite just a few weeks into the reality show. However, Leo, reacting, took to his Twitter page, saying Erica could be acting and her feelings and actions may be fake at the moment. According to him, the BBNaija female housemate could just be using the platform to promote her acting career. His tweet read: “Don’t rule out the fact that Erica might be acting. She’s a fantastic actor. “Big brother could be just one big movie production to her.” Meanwhile, Erica before entering the reality show was an upcoming actress and featured in ‘Hire a woman’ Netflix movie, ‘My flatmates’ among others. She studied screen acting at the Met Film School in the UK.

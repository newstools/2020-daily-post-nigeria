Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho, has revealed what will happen if a transfer for him to join Manchester United fails to materialize this summer. According to Kicker, Sancho has made it clear at an early stage to Dortmund that if a transfer to the Premier League giants fails to materialize, he will work with the same dedication and commitment for the success of the club. Sancho had already agreed on a personal term with Man United as the Red Devils remain favourite to agree to a deal for him this summer transfer window. Dortmund have already told Man United to sign Sancho before August 10 (today) when their 2020/21 pre-season tour will commence. The Bundesliga club had made it clear they will only let Sancho leave if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side can meet their huge £120 million asking price for the player. Meanwhile, Borussia Dortmund will offer Jadon Sancho an improved contract, if Manchester United don’t match their £108million asking price by Monday, BILD reports. However, both clubs are at a deadlock over a fee for Sancho, with Man United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward believing Dortmund’s asking price for the England youngster is too high given the current economic climate. Sancho, 20, scored 17 goals and registered 17 assists in 34 Bundesliga games for Dortmund this season.

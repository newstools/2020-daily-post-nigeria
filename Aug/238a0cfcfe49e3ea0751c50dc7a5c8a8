Arsenal boss, Mikel Arteta, wants the club to sign three players this summer transfer window in order to fit his plans to play a 4-3-3 system next season. Arteta won his first trophy as a manager on Saturday after the Gunners defeated Chelsea 2-1 in the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium. According to The Times, Arteta’s FA Cup victory now puts him in a sturdier position with Arsenal’s chiefs in terms of being backed in the transfer market this summer. The Spaniard is “keen” on signing Barcelona’s Philippe Coutinho, Atletico Madrid’s Thomas Partey and Chelsea’s Willian. Coutinho has been strongly linked with a move to Arsenal in the past few weeks as Barcelona want to sell the Brazilian international. Partey is also keen to join Arteta’s side this summer. Willian is edging closer to the exit door at Chelsea, after rejecting the club’s latest offer to sign a new two-year contract.

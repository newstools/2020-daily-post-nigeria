Only five Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemates, are exempted from possible eviction this week. Housemates on Monday were told to nominate two housemates for possible eviction next Sunday. After the diary sessions, the housemates up for possible eviction are Lucy, Trikytee, Vee, Kiddwaya, Nengi, and Laycon. Those that are saved were Dorathy, Neo, Ozo, Prince and Erica. Earlier, Erica won the Head of House challenge after a dice game, which gave her immunity from nomination. She chose Prince as Deputy Head of House, which gives them immunity from eviction.

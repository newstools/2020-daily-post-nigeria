Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Dorathy, has advised Laycon about his feelings for Erica. Laycon had developed feelings and declared his intention to Erica. However, he was turned down on Tuesday as Erica made it clear that she is physically attracted to Kiddwaya and just mentally attracted to him. He has since distanced himself from Erica which got the attention of Dorathy. Dorathy took over the role of a love expert as she advised Laycon not to distance himself from Erica else he would lose her to Kiddwaya. “If something is going to happen it’s going to happen naturally without pressure. “Do not tell Erica you don’t want to talk to her for a while because that way, you will push her to start hanging with Kiddwaya more. “That is risky because you will still be here and you’re pushing her and what if she gets comfortable with the person.” However, Laycon in response said he does not care as long as Erica is happy.

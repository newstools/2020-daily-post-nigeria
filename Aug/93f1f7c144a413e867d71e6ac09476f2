The Vicar of Anglican Church of the Epiphany, Abuja, Ven. Ifeanyi Akunna, has urged the Federal government to stop the Big Brother Nigeria, BBNaija, reality show. Akunna said the BBNaija reality show promotes immorality among Nigerian youths. In a message entitled: ‘A House Built on Faulty Foundation,’ the clergyman lamented that Nigerians’ addiction to shows like ” BBNaija does not add to their moral value,” NAN reports. The cleric stressed that the show does not encourage a healthy relationship with God. “All who watch the reality programme, BBNaija, should desist from it and ask God for forgiveness as it does not promote a healthy relationship with God, neither does it promote healthy marital values. “These things contribute to the faulty foundations upon which people build their lives and future. “Any foundation that is not built on Jesus Christ must surely collapse — as only Jesus is the sure anchor of our lives and souls,” he said.

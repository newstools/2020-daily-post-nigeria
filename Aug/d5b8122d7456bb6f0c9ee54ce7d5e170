Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Dorathy has expressed regrets over Brighto’s eviction. Brighto was evicted alongside Tolanibaj and Wathoni on Sunday after they scored lowest votes from the viewers. When asked how she felt about his eviction, Dorathy said she regrets not having personal conversations with Brighto before he got evicted. “I wish I had more conversation with Brighto “I wish we spoke personally and I didn’t just walk past him most times.” DAILY POST recalls that Dorathy had told Wathoni that she has no true feelings for Brighto but just lust. She gave way for Wathoni to be with Brighto because she valued their friendship more.

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, wants to make Thiago Silva his new captain, should he complete his free transfer in the coming days, Globo reports. Thiago admitted he had played his last game for Paris Saint-Germain last Sunday, following a 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League. PSG boss, Thomas Tuchel, is desperate for the 35-year-old to remain with the Ligue 1 champions, but the Brazilianâ€™s mind is made up. And part of that may be down the importance of the role he is set to play at Stamford Bridge. Lampard will ask Silva to wear the armband for the 2020/2021 season, taking it from Cesar Azpilicueta. This decision could lead to tensions within the dressing room, as Azpilicueta is popular among squad members. The Spaniard has won the Chelsea armband before the 2019/2020 began.

Three men have been sentenced to four and eighteen months in prison respectively for stealing electricity cables in Kano State. Usman Sabo, Yahya Ali and Babangida Lawan were sentenced in two different magistrate courts after the state electricity distribution company secured their conviction. Usman Sabo and Yahya Ali are to serve four months jail terms as declared by Magistrate court 66 Koki while Babangida Lawal is to pay a fine to the electricity company or serve 18 months if he defaults in payment of the fine as sentenced by Magistrate Court 77. Speaking after securing the convictions, the company spokesman, Ibrahim Shawai said it was part of the tireless efforts being put in place to arrest activities of vandals. “This is done to ensure that we protect the interest of customers and also to continue to ensure that we give uninterrupted supply and better service delivery to the general public.” He said, “this conviction will also serve as a deterrent to those who are still in the business of vandalism and theft, as we will not relent in our effort to bring the activities of economic saboteurs to a halt through the instrument of the law. We also appeal to community leaders to help us end the activities of vandals and other related issues by reporting suspected attempts in that regard to security personnel.

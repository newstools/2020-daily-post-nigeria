Governor of Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, has charged officials of the state chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, to work together and ensure the party wins all upcoming elections. Ikpeazu advised the newly-elected executives of the state chapter of the party at the PDP Congress, in Umuahia Township Stadium in the state capital. Recall that at the congress on Saturday, a former Speaker of the State House of Assembly, Rt Hon Asiforo Okere, had emerged as the party’s Chairman, while Chief Obinna Nwachukwu was elected the Deputy Chairman. Reacting to the outcome of the congress, Ikpeazu said the newly elected party executives should start working and ensure they win new members and galvanize support for the party. Ikpeazu noted that election victories should not be taken for granted despite the party’s consistent victory in the state. “PDP is Abia State and Abia State is PDP”, Ikpeazu said. The Governor noted that PDP being the hope of Nigerians in the next general elections, has a very demanding task ahead, stressing that all members are needed to achieve the set objectives. While assuring them of his support at all times, Ikpeazu reminded the new executives that they have been elected to serve the people and not the other way round. He, therefore, called on members of the party to also cooperate with and support the executives to enable them deliver on their mandate. The Governor, however, urged aggrieved members to seek redress through the appropriate channels in the party.

The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), on Tuesday denied receiving any money from terrorist group in or outside Nigeria. The group director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, gave the denial in a statement, following reports that it’s receiving N200,000 from Islamic State for West Africa Province (ISWAP). Akintola described the allegation as illogical, adding that the group has always condemned every act of terror. The group said it was a wicked concoction from the pit of Jahannam, adding that it has never had any contact with ISWAP or any terrorist group. “We remain committed to the unity and indivisibility of Nigeria,” the organization director said. “The motto of MURIC is ‘dialogue, not violence’. So how can we descend so low as to collect money from terrorists? Such lies will not fly. “The terrorists themselves know that we can never support them. How can they give us money? The allegation is dead on arrival. The group, therefore, appealed to the Buhari-led Government to investigate the source of the information.

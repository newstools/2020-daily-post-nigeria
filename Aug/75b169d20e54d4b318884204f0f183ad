Big brother Naija Lockdown housemate, Nengi has said she can’t pursue a relationship with Ozo because he is too peaceful. Nengi said this after a heated argument with Lucy. Recall that on Sunday Nengi and Lucy hurled insults at each other shortly after the live show. Nengi had confronted Lucy angrily over an issue and while responding, Lucy said Nengi only knows how to flaunt herself before male housemates and be with different men every week. After the incident, Ozo called for a meeting with housmates and the issue was sorted out. Still angry about the issue, Nengi in a conversation with Ozo at the garden, queried why housemates were bothered about how she dresses in the house. Reacting, Ozo maintained that he was not bothered and urged her to remain calm. She responded, “That is why I told you from the onset, you are too peaceful for me. I cannot possibly be with a guy that all he knows is peace.” "I'll pepper dem. I can't be with a guy as peaceful as you," #Nengi to #Ozo #bbnaija2020 #BBNaijialockdown2020 pic.twitter.com/MwG3g5nBVj — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 10, 2020

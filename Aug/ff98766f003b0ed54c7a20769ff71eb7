Two hundred and eighty-eight more stranded Nigerians on Monday arrived in the country from Dubai before the August 17 deadline for undocumented immigrants to leave the United Arab Emirates. This now brings to 2,641 the total number of Nigerian evacuees from the UAE so far. The Chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, NiDCOM, Abike Dabiri-Erewa made this known on her official Twitter handle. Abike-Dabiri disclosed that all the returnees upon arrival tested negative to COVID-19. She added that they would, however, be tested again for COVID-19 at the NCDC facility and will proceed on a 14-day compulsory self-isolation.

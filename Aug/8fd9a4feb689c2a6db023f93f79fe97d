Former Premier League and La Liga striker, Michael Owen, has criticised Barcelona players, including Lionel Messi and Suarez after Quique Setien’s men eliminated Napoli from the Champions League. Barcelona knocked out Napoli from the Champions League round of 16 second-leg at Camp Nou, thanks to three goals from Clement Lenglet, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. Barca advanced to the last-8 on 4-2 aggregate, having played 1-1 with Napoli in the first leg back in February. But Owen believes Barcelona players are ‘disjointed’, adding that they don’t look like a team that will reach the Champions League final. “When you look at the attempts on goal, it’s one-sided. Barcelona don’t look like a team that is going to get all the way to the final.” Owen told BT Sport. “Barcelona have got talented players, but it’s an ageing team. There’s not a lot of pace in attacking areas. They’re a bit disjointed. “They don’t look like Barcelona to me. I think it will be a bit of a rebuilding job for them over the next few seasons.”

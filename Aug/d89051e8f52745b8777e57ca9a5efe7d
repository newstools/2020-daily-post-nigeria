Big Brother Naija housemate, Ozo, has advised Neo to call his lover, Vee, and talk to her privately after their burst up last night. Vee and Neo, who have been talked about as the best couple in the house, are currently having a serious fight. The whole fuss started after Neo was sighted by Vee dancing with Kaisha in a seemingly too close position during the Saturday night party. To add insult to injury, Kaisha and Neo were same night caught together in the bathroom. Praise disclosed this to Wathoni and asked her to go and confirm in the bathroom. Angered by the scenarios playing out in a rather very short period of time, Vee has refused to talk to her man. And Ozo feels that Neo should talk to Vee and clear his name if really he has nothing with the Sokoto-born female housemate. “Call Vee and talk to her. You as a guy you don’t let things drag. Sit her down and tell her you want to talk to her about something, that’s it.” Ozo went on to say that he had also advised Nengi, even though they are not dating, to make peace with Kaisha after their fight on Friday.

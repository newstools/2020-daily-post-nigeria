Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said they will not be rushed into a deal for Borussia Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho. Negotiations are still on, with United set to pay around €70million upfront for Sancho, with another €50m in installments and bonus payments. The German club have reportedly set an August 10 deadline for a transfer to be completed, so they can begin preparations for the new season. However, Solskjaer has made it clear they will not panic in the market. “This transfer window is a long one and every transfer takes its course,” Solskjaer said at a news conference today. “It is what it is. We are always looking to improve the team and squad. At the moment I have no updates for you, If there’s any news we’ll update you.” —

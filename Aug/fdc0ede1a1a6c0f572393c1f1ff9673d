Big Brother Naija, housemate Vee has given reason for voting Kaisha out of the reality show. Kaisha was evicted on Sunday after she appeared on the bottom four, among housemates with the least votes. Vee was among the majority of housemates who chose Wathoni and Kaisha to be evicted in the seasons’ style of voting, introduced by organisers. Giving reasons for voting Kaisha, Vee during her diary session with Big brother said she felt Kaisha was struggling in the house. “I voted for Kaisha because out of the bottom four I felt it has been a struggle for her. “I chose Wathoni on the other hand because I could not pick two of my favourite people; Neo and Trikytee. “It’s nothing personal towards Wathoni but Trikytee makes me happy,” Vee said. Meanwhile, the organisers of BBNaija have been criticised for the new voting process which leaves the final decision of who to be evicted every Sunday in the hand of housemates and not the fans.

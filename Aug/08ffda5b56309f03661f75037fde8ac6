The FCT Police Command has rescued two children, subjected to inhuman treatment by their guardian in Abuja. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) in the FCT, Mr Anjuguri Manzah made this known in a statement on Saturday in Abuja. He disclosed that the children were rescued by operatives from the command following a tip-off on Friday that the children were allegedly locked in a toilet by their guardian. The PPRO said the perpetrator lives on the second floor of a two storey building in FCDA quarters, Garki. “One of the victims, 9-year-old, who escaped through the window of their guardian’s apartment raised the alarm that led to the rescue of the second victim, also 9-year-old. “The second victim was rescued from the apartment by operatives from Garki Police Division and Federal Fire Service,” he added. Manzah said the guardian was reported to have been subjecting the children to undue hardship by starving them of food and locking them in the toilet until her return from work late at night, NAN reports. The PPRO added that an investigation into the case was ongoing.

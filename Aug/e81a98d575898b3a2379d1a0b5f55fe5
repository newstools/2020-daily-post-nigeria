Former Real Madrid and Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Manchester United to beat LASK 3-0 in tonight’s Europa League round of 16 second-leg tie at Old Trafford. Man United defeated LASK 5-0 in the first leg tie in Linz on March 12 before the COVID-19 lockdown break. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men head to the game after a 2-0 win over Leicester City in the Premier League final day fixture last week. Providing his prediction, Owen wrote in his column for BetVictor, “United have already qualified for next season’s Champions League, by way of their third-place finish in the Premier League. “They were very comfortable winners in the first leg of this tie when they thrashed LASK 5-0 in Linz way back in March. “It is difficult to see anything other than another tough night for the Austrian team, and I’m going for another clean sheet and easy victory for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men in this one. Manchester United to win 3-0.” The match kick-off time is 8 pm.

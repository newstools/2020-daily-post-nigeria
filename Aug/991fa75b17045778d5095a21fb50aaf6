DAILY POST had reported that soldiers on earlier on Tuesday rounded up senior government and military officers in Kati town and elsewhere.

For nearly three months, demonstrations demanding for Keita’s resignation were held. Dozens lost their lives, a situation that worsened the crisis. Keita’s removal comes amid the intervention by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Leaders met late July but failed to achieve a truce. ECOWAS insists it could no order a sitting president to vacate office. In July, the United Nations (UN), European Union (EU), African Union (AU) condemned government’s use of lethal force on protesters.

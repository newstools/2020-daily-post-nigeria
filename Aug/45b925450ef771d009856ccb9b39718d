Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has explained why he dropped winger, Gareth Bale, from his side’s Champions League round of 16 second-leg squad to face Manchester City on Friday night at Etihad Stadium. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Zidane omitted Bale from Real Madrid’s 24-man squad to tackle Pep Guardiola’s men. But Zidane is now saying that he excluded Bale from the Los Blancos squad because the former Tottenham Hotspur star “didn’t want to play”. Asked why he omitted the Welsh international, Zidane said as quoted by Sky Sports: “It was a personal conversation I had with him. “He preferred not to play. The rest remains between him and me, but he said he didn’t want to.” Real Madrid head to the game following a 2-1 defeat to Man City in the first-leg at the Santiago Bernabeu in February.

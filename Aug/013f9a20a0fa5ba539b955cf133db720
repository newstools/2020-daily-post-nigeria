Apostle Johnson Suleman, Senior Pastor of Omega Fire Ministries has reacted to claims by Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai that his refusal to give ‘brown envelope” was responsible for the continued killings in Southern Kaduna. DAILY POST had reported that El-Rufai who appeared on Channels Television, said that his predecessors paid some leaders to stop such acts but he’s administration on assumption of power stopped it. According to him, some of the Southern Kaduna leaders were aggrieved that he stopped the alleged payment. He was quoted as saying, “Most of the people saying they have no means of livelihood were living off the government. The governments before us were paying them money every month, they called it peace money. We stopped it. This is why they say I am taking sides.” Reacting, Apostle Suleman dared El-Rufai to mention the names of the leaders or keep quiet and fix the mess. He tweeted, “Just heard the Kaduna governor say some elites in Kaduna want ‘brown envelopes’, that’s why they are fanning the embers of war. “If you are sure of your claims, mention their names so we drag them on this street. If not, keep quiet and fix the mess. Enough of the bloodshed.”

Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has been offered to Barcelona in a sensational move that would see him line up alongside Lionel Messi, according to Spanish journalist Guillem Balague. Ronaldo could leave Turin after only two seasons, as the Serie A champions are trying to get his massive £28m-per-year salary off their books. In a bid to achieve this, Juve has been offering the Portugal captain to Europe’s top clubs including Barcelona. “He’s been offered everywhere, including Barcelona. I’m not sure if they can get rid of him easily with the kind of money he earns. “Who is going to pay that kind of money?” Balague said on BBC. Messi himself might not be at Barca next season, with his contract expiring in less than 10 months. Strangely, Messi has been linked with a move to Serie A side, Inter Milan.

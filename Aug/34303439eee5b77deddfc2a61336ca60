The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) says the old style of doing things must give way. The commission said henceforth, the use of technology would be deepened. The Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, represented by Festus Okoye, National Commissioner for Information, said this on Friday at a virtual workshop on the revised “INEC Communication Policy”. “This is the basis of the introduction of the INEC party nomination portal, the election observer accreditation portal and the media accreditation portal. “Transparency in the result transmission process led to the development and deployment of the INEC Result Viewing Portal wherein the commission uploads Forms EC8A for public viewing,” he said. The commission promised to continue to go with global trends in election management and communication. The body urged the media, civil society groups and all relevant stakeholders to assist the commission to succeed. Yakubu described the INEC Communication Policy as a composite document designed to address both internal and external communication processes and procedures. He appealed to information managers must therefore communicate in such a way that people will see and appreciate election as an essential service.

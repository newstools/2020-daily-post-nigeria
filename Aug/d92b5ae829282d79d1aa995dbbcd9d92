Adamawa State has a shortfall of 9,000 classrooms across schools in the state. A government agency which disclosed this, said the state needs to build more classrooms to effectively deliver education to primary school pupils and students in junior secondary schools across the 21 Local Government Areas of the state. The Executive Chairman of the Adamawa State Universal Basic Education Board (ADSUBEB), Dr Salihi Ateequ, told newsmen in the state capital, Yola, that shortage of classrooms and other needs rose in previous years because the board suffered much neglect in the hands of preceding governments. Ateequ who became the ASSUBEB chairman about two months ago, said the board began to function properly only when the Ahmadu Fintiri administration came in last year and began to pay counterpart funding which the board requires to access funding from the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) in Abuja. He said that to address the deficit in classrooms, the board is constructing 1,800 classrooms with the 2018/2019 UBEC intervention funds. He assured that the schoolsâ€™ capacity expansion effort would be heightened, with a target of putting up all the needed 9,000 classrooms in the next three years. Also, during the interaction with newsmen in his office, the ADSUBEB chairman disclosed that the state had commenced a school radio programme by which lessons are delivered through radio for the benefit of the pupils.

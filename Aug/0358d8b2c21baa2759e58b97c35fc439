Cristiano Ronaldo has spoken for the first time, since Juventus suffered a last-16 exit from the Champions League and sacked Maurizio Sarri as manager. Ronaldo in a social media post, urged the Serie A champions to do some ‘reflection’. Juve crashed out on Friday despite Ronaldo’s brace to earn a 2-1 victory in their second-leg clash with Lyon, with the Ligue 1 side progressing on away goals. The result leaves the Bianconeri still hunting for their first Champions League success since 1996. Ronaldo finished the season with 37 goals in 46 games. “The 2019/20 season is over for us, much later than usual but yet sooner than we expected. “Now it’s time for reflection. A huge club such as Juventus must always think like the best in the world and work like the best in the world. “Winning the Serie A in such a difficult year is something that we are very proud of. But the fans demand more from us and we have to deliver, we must live up to the highest expectations. “May this short vacation break allow us all to make the best decisions for the future and come back stronger and more committed than ever,” Ronaldo wrote. —

Zamfara State governor, Hon. Bello Muhammad Matawalle has ordered the immediate use of Islamic Calendars in primary, secondary and tertiary institutions across the state. Governor Matawalle disclosed this, Sunday, at the state Secretariat in Gusau, the state capital during the launching of the Islamic New Year Calendar 1442 AH, which began last Friday. The event was organised by Joint Youths Islamic Organisation. The governor, who spoke through the Secretary to the State Government, Alhaji Bala Bello Maru explained that the use of the Islamic calendar in all institutions of learning had become very imperative. He urged all Muslim faithful in the country to ensure that their children memorised the Islamic months and dates and be able to tell which month and day of the year at all times. Matawalle in collaboration with the Chairman of the Zamfara state Social Investment programme bought fifty copies of the calendar, each at the cost of N1 million. However, the immediate past Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Abdullahi Muhammad Shinkafi, who initially donated a bud to the association, also bought 20 copies of the calendar at the cost of N100,000.

Big Brother Naija housemate, Nengi, has come under fire from viewers of the reality show, for demarcating herself from Ozo with a pillow. Ozo, on Monday won the Head of House (HoH) task and chose Nengi as his deputy. The rules mandate that the HoH chooses a housemate of the opposite sex as deputy. Though both housemates are friends and always seen together in different locations in the house, Nengi had made it clear that she would not want to date any housemate, not even Ozo. Her actions on Monday night, however, led to criticisms on social media: @OlisaOsega: If you were going to use a pillow to demarcate the bed, you had no business accepting the role of deputy HOH. If Nengi knew she was uncomfortable sleeping on the same bed with Ozo, she could’ve easily declined the offer. It’s not compulsory to accept the role. @iamshadyyy: I still can’t believe ozo and nengi had sex last night @Nnamdii_: It took these guys 6 seasons to kiss, even tho everyone knew they loved each other. Ozo and Nengi shouldn’t make us wait that long abeg. @Royie21308421: Me fellow ozone-shippers please this ship is not leaving the harbor anytime soon or ever. Nengi is just not into Ozo let’s make peace with that @PoojaMedia: Ozo is a very nice guy tho. Despite the toxic night with Nengi, he still in the kitchen making breakfast for both when madam still dey bed. Get a man like Ozo. @NzubeEsq: I pity Ozo shaa. The way Nengi fans are mocking him like he had a bad intention for looking out for their Queen, Nengi. A perfect gentleman who would have been the face of this show has turned himself to an object of ridicule. I wish him the best in life shaa @Drewbaba: Nengi really put up a pillow wall between her and Ozo last night.. this babe is so extra. #Bbnaija

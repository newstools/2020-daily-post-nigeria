Manchester City boss, Pep Guardiola, has hailed his team’s high press for their 2-1 win over Real Madrid on Friday night. The Etihad club are through to the quarter-finals on a 4-2 aggregate, after they had won 2-1 in Spain before the COVID-19 lockdown. Raheem Sterling opened scoring for City, after Raphael Varane was caught napping at the back. Although Karim Benzema headed Madrid level, another Varane error allowed Gabriel Jesus to score the winner. Guardiola, speaking to BT Sport, said: “We created a lot of chances and scored two goals with mistakes from them. We tried to convince them to go, go and attack but it is not easy against this team. On pressing teams, the former Barcelona manager added: “We try to do it, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t. In general we did a good job. “It is important, we beat them twice. Zinedine Zidane never lost knockout games. You see the calm and personality they play with, they are good. We are here to try and win the Champions League. It is one step, if we think that is enough we will show how small we are. If you want to win you have to beat the big clubs.”

Manchester United have revealed the seven teams they could draw from Pot 1 ahead of the 2020/21 Champions League group-stage draws in a post on its website on Monday. Recall that Bayern Munich defeated Paris Saint-Germain 1-0 on August 23 to win the 2019/20 Champions League. Man United are looking forward to playing in Europe top-flight tournament once again, after a season in the Europa League. Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s side will be in Pot 2 when the 2020/21 Champions League group-stage draw takes place in Athens, Greece, on October 1. With the first qualifying round already in full swing, six places for that draw are yet to be confirmed, meaning some seedings could still change, but the identity of the eight clubs in Pot 1 can now be revealed. The seven potential opponents for Man United are Bayern Munich, PSG, Real Madrid, Juventus, FC Porto, Zenit St. Petersburg and Sevilla, who defeated the Red Devils in the 2019/20 Europa League semi-final. The only team in Pot 1 Man United cannot be drawn against is Liverpool because they are both Premier League clubs and will not be paired up until the quarter-final stage, at the earliest.

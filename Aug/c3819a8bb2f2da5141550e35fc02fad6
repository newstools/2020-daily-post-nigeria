Willian has announced he is leaving Chelsea after seven years with the club. The Brazilian confirmed his exit in an open letter to fans on Sunday. It read in part: “The time has now come to move on. I am certainly going to miss my teammates. I will miss all the staff at the club who’ve always treated me like a son and I will miss the fans. “I leave with my head held high, safe in the knowledge that I won things here and always did my best in a Chelsea shirt!” Willian is believed to have rejected a two-year contract extension with the Blues. He will now sign for their London rivals Arsenal in the coming days after the Gunners offered him a three-year deal. —

One of the killers of Uwaila Vera Omozua, who was murdered while studying inside a Redeem Christian Church of God, RCCG in Edo State has confessed that he received 1 million Naira to kill his victim. Uwaila, a 100 level Microbiology student of UNIBEN, was gruesomely raped and murdered in May 2020. The suspect, Collins Uligbe, who hails from Agbor in Ika North East Local Government Area of Delta State, made the confession while being paraded alongside other suspects by the Edo State Police Command. Collins said his landlady, Mrs Mary Ade, gave them N1 million to kill the undergraduate. He said after the act, he used a handkerchief given to him by Mrs Mary Ade to wipe Uwa’s blood and private part and returned it to his landlady. According to him, she wanted to use it for rituals. He gave the names of the other suspected killers as Nelson Ogbebor, Tina Samuel, another lady, Valentine Akato and Nosa Osabohien. Narrating the incident, Collins said although they were six that carried out the crime, he was outside giving them signals before he joined them inside the church. Collins said Nelson he hit the victim with a plank and when she tried to stand up he hit her with the fire extinguisher in the church. The suspects were traced through a man who bought the victim’s phone for N17,000. “I bought phone from Collins; on 27th May Osaro came to my workplace at Agba Park, we bargained and he sold the phone for N17,000 to me. The next week I was tracked and arrested,” the man had confessed. However, Mary Ade, denied the allegation, saying she neither gave him the money nor asked him to wipe the lady’s private part. Recall that the death of Uwa had raised concerns and stirred reactions from notable figures, as well as Nigerians on the social media.

Unknown gunmen have killed a former treasurer of the Nasarawa State Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Mr Benjamin Ekom. Ekom, who was also a former Secretary-General of the Eggon Cultural and Development Association (ECDA) was killed on Monday at his house in Washo, Akun. Speaking to newsmen, the traditional ruler of the Aren-Akun community, Alhaji Usman Galadima-Umbugadu, described the killing of Ekom as unfortunate and barbaric. Galadima-Umbugadu also described him as a committed subject whose contributions would be missed by the chiefdom. “Yes, it is true that my subject, who served as the ECDA secretary, was attacked and killed in his house in Washo community by gunmen. “This is unfortunate, barbaric, and uncalled,” he said. The monarch said that Ekom contributed a lot to the development of the chiefdom, advising the family and the community to take solace in God. Also speaking, Mr Adams Makka-Nangba, District Head of Wakama community, described Ekom’s death as not only a great loss to the family but to the entire Akun chiefdom. “It is sad that Benjamin Ekom, the former ECDA Secretary-General, was assassinated in his house yesterday night,” he said. Makka-Nangba prayed for the repose of the soul of the former information officer. However, the Spokesman of the Nasarawa State Police Command, Mr. Ramhan Nansel, when contacted said that he was yet to receive information on the death of Ekom. “I am yet to get that information. I will make my finding,’’ Nansel said. Meanwhile, the corpse of the murdered journalist has been deposited at a hospital mortuary in Akwanga, NAN reports.

The National Coordinator, Congress of University Academics (CONUA), Niyi Sunmonu, says its members are ready to resume work. This was contained in a statement he issued on Saturday after a National Executive Council meeting. Sunmonu told the federal government to reopen universities and put in place infrastructure and COVID-19 protocols. He stressed that the education sector cannot continue to stagnate. Sunmonu said COVID-19 would continue to be a threat, adding that everyone must strive to live a normal life. ”The Union urges the government to make available everything that can help our universities to resume work as it is being done elsewhere in the world,” NAN quoted him as saying. He condemned the harassment of some of its members by some university administrations and other unions within the university system. Sunmonu declared that no amount of molestation or vilification can take the union away from the path of progressive unionism. “Adequate measures, as far as the law and constitution of Nigeria permits, will be taken against anyone who is using intimidation or employing any other odious means to threaten our members.” The coordinator lauded university administrations that held meetings to promote academic staff members during the COVID-19 lockdown.

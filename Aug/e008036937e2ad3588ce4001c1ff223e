Real Madrid have made a u-turn over midfielder, Dani Ceballos’s stay at Arsenal. Zinedine Zidane’s side initially wanted Ceballos to extend his loan at Arsenal, but Real Madrid’s hierarchy now wants to keep the Spaniard for their pre-season campaign instead of loaning him out again to the Gunners. Ceballos impressed in his final few months under Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta and ended his season-long loan by helping Arsenal beat Chelsea at Wembley to win the FA Cup on August 1. Arteta has made it clear that he is keen for the 24-year-old to remain at Emirates for another season after he formed a solid midfield partnership with Granit Xhaka during the Premier League restart. However, according to Spain newspaper, AS, the La Liga champions have now reconsidered Ceballos’ future following his impressive performances for Arteta’s side. Madrid’s chiefs are convinced that Ceballos can become a first-team regular under Zidane at Santiago Bernabeu. Meanwhile, Ceballos has since informed Real Madrid that he will not stay at Bernabeu and accept a bit-part role under Zidane.

Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, has been given permission by the club to fly to Turkey, according to Goal. The German has been allowed to travel, as he is not going to be involved in Saturday’s FA Cup final against Chelsea at Wembley. Also, only 10 non-playing personnel would be allowed as well as the match day squad. Ozil has not featured for Arsenal at all, since the Premier League restarted last month. Mikel Arteta has also left Matteo Guendouzi out of the team for the game. Guendouzi has not played since the second game of Project Restart – a 2-1 defeat to Brighton – where he clashed with opposition players. It is believed Arteta wants to sell him this summer.

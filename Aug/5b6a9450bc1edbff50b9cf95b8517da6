The Social Democratic Party, SDP has described the local government election held on Saturday in Ondo State as a charade. The Deputy National Chairman (South) of the party, Dr. Olu Agunloye who condemned the electoral process in the state said the election has further exposed the fact that the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC is no longer popular among the people. According to Agunloye, “We have seen a charade called an election. We noticed that the APC government led by Akeredolu must have meant to design this election after winning the primaries to boost the impression created by APC but events before, during and after the election, shows the APC is not popular on ground. “What has happened now, rather than shore up their chances, it has exposed them. Imagine a party like APC tearing up posters of parties like SDP, ADC and snatching boxes. They had even been thump printing before the election. The people of Ondo State have known the ruling party is not exactly what they are.” Recall that, three days ago, SDP had alleged that its candidates participating in the election were attacked by hoodlums suspected to be APC members in Idanre local government. Also, on Friday, violent clashes were recorded in Ondo West Local Government Area of the state between supporters of the All Progressives Congress, APC and African Democratic Congress, ADC.

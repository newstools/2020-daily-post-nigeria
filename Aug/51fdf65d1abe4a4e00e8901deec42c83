Arsenal playmaker, Mesut Ozil, has been offered a £15million-per-year contract by Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr, Fanatik reports. Ozil’s current £350,000-per-week deal with the Gunners expires in 2021. The German has not been picked by Mikel Arteta since football resumed after the Coronavirus break. It is believed Arsenal are eager to get their highest earner off their books. Al-Nassr want Ozil this summer, but will persuade him to join as a free agent, if they can’t agree on a fee with the Premier League team. Ozil is yet to return for pre-season with Arsenal and was not included in the squad that won the Community Shield against Liverpool last weekend.

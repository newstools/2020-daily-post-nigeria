Manchester City will offer Lionel Messi a £450m five-year deal to quit Barcelona, according to the UK Mirror. Messi failed to show up for preseason tests on Sunday, after notifying the club via fax earlier in the week of his desire to leave. His decision led to many top European clubs scrambling to put together funds to sign the 33-year-old. However, City are favourites to land Messi, if he eventually quits the Camp Nou this summer. The Premier League club also have the Pep Guardiola advantage, with the Spaniard having coached Messi for four seasons at Barca. City will offer Messi £90m-a-year to move to the Etihad, which is a similar figure to what he currently earns in Spain. LaLiga on Sunday, insisted that any potential suitors must pay the player’s full release clause.

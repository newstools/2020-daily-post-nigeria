Nigerian singer, Peter of the defunct group P-Square, has reacted to a viral video on purported reconciliation with his brother, Paul. In the video, which went viral on social media during the weekend, Peter Okoye could be heard apologising about the issues with his brother, asking fans for forgiveness. He also made comments like ‘‘P-Square is back together.” However, responding to a post by a Nigerian on Twitter, Peter debunked the news. According to him, it is an old video from 2015. His tweet read: “Old Video 2015, forever Mr P.” <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-830140" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_4558.jpg" alt="" width="828" height="1418" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_4558.jpg 828w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_4558-175x300.jpg 175w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_4558-598x1024.jpg 598w" sizes="(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px">

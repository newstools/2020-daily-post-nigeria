Former Real Madrid and Liverpool star, Michael Owen, has predicted the scoreline of tonight’s Champions League last-8 fixture between Paris Saint-Germain and Atalanta. PSG head to the game after eliminating Dortmund from the Champions League last-16, while Atalanta knocked out Valencia. But Owen expects the French Ligue 1 champions to beat the Serie A side 2-1 at the Estádio da Luz Stadium in Portugal. “I fancy that this could be closer than many people think, but with Kylian Mbappe likely to be fit for PSG and Josep Ilicic who has already scored five goals for Atalanta in this year’s competition likely to miss out through injury, I fancy a 2-1 win for Thomas Tuchel’s side,” Owen wrote in his column for BetVictor. The match kick-off time is 8 pm

Speaking with journalists in Bauchi on Sunday, Dogo submitted that the local government elections are long overdue in the state. He declared that the local government councils in the state have suffered for over 12 years without elected council officials, adding that the decision of the administration to conduct council elections should be applauded by all. The PDP chieftain reiterated the state government’s readiness to deepen democracy at the grassroots with the conduct of credible elections across the state. “We (PDP) are not scared of what the out­come of local government elections will be because we are convinced that our candidates are people of integrity. “They are popular candidates. We want to make sure that they have something to point to as what our party has done and we always advise them to continue to meet the people where they are and not just concentrating at the local government headquarters that are usually urban,” Dogo said.

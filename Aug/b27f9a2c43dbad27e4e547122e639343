Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, a.k.a Winners Chapel, has declared that he would embrace and breathe into COVID-19 patients without any fear of contracting the disease. He said he would lay his bare hands on any coronavirus patient brought to him for prayer. Bishop Oyedepo said he would not wear gloves to attend to COVID-19 patients but would lay his bare hands on them to receive healing. “COVID-19 cannot be any reason why your own ‘Breaking Limit’ package will not be delivered,” Bishop Oyedepo said while addressing his congregation on Sunday. “It’s not a tenable reason,” he said. The cleric noted that no condition on earth will make God’s covenant come to no effect. “Can you imagine anyone bringing coronavirus patient to me and I won’t lay hands on him? “Will I wear gloves to lay hands on them? “I will lay hands on them, breathe into them, embrace them. “What you carry is eternal life, it’s not human life,” he added.

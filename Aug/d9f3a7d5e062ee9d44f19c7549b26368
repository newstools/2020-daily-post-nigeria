Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, Erica, has picked Kiddwaya as her Deputy Head of House.
Many had thought Erica would pick Laycon, but she snubbed him for Kiddwaya. Erica had emerged winner of this week’s Head of House contest earlier on Monday. She tallied 23 points to win the dice game, three more than her closest competitor. This means both her and Kiddwaya are exempted from this week’s eviction.

Nigerian government has reacted to the video of Nigerian ladies stranded in Saudi Arabia. DAILY POST earlier reported the video of the young lady in hijab crying out to President Muhammadu Buhari and other authorities to rescue her and other ladies from Saudi Arabia. According to her, they are stranded and want to return to Nigeria. Reacting, Abike Dabiri-Erewa, Chairman of Nigerians in Diaspora Commission, NIDCOM, assured that the commission was working together with the Saudi institution to bring back about 200 prisoners. She also directed the lady in the video and others stranded in Saudi Arabia to report to the mission on Sunday and register in order to seek permission and process their return. On her Twitter page, the NIDCOM Chairman wrote: “There are processes and procedures to follow. Saudi institutions are on holidays. They resume Sunday. “Rather than come anonymously here, from Sunday when they open for work, they should go to the mission to register. The mission will then appeal for permit, etc. and they will return. “Moreso it’s the prisoners ( about 200) that the Saudis want to bring back. They want to decongest their deportation centres. But the bone of contention now is that the prisoners must get their COVID-19 tests done before evacuation. Discussions will continue after they resume on Sunday.”

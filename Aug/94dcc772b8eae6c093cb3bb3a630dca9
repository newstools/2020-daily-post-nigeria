One of Big Brother Naija housemates, Ozo has given reasons he saved Eric, Praise and voted out Lilo and Ka3na. Recall that Ka3na and Lilo were evicted on Sunday during a live eviction show. The organizer of the show had introduced a new twist, directing housemates to pick two housemates out of Lilo, Eric, Praise and Ka3na who had the lowest votes. Speaking on Sunday’s eviction, Ozo during his diary session said he voted out the ladies, Lilo and Ka3na because he is close to the guys who were up for eviction. Ozo said although he related well with Ka3na, his decision was based on friendship. He said, “I was closer to the guys, Eric and praise. Although I established a relationship with Ka3na after our conversation about relationships on Saturday night, my decision was based on the fact that I am closer to Praise and Eric.”

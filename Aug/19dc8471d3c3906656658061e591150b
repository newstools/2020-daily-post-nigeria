The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), on Thursday, warned the principals of government-owned secondary schools against non-compliance with COVID-19 safety guidelines. The Chairman, FCT Ministerial Enforcement Taskforce on COVID-19 Restrictions, Ikharo Attah gave the warning during an inspection tour of some schools in Kubwa, Dutsen Alhaji and Gwarinpa Housing estate. Attah expressed displeasure over the compliance level in some government-owned schools visited. He said “ I am totally disappointed with the non- compliance of the COVID-19 protocols by some schools specifically at the Junior Secondary School Kubwa which is located inside Kubwa Model Primary school in Phase 3. “Principals and management teams of public-owned schools must ensure full compliance with the guidelines. In private schools, the compliance level is near one hundred per cent. While most government schools are doing well, few are not serious at all. “What we all saw today at Junior Secondary School Kubwa 3 is quite disheartening. “Principals and their management team in all government schools must do the needful,” he said. He also advised the students, to adhere to the COVID-19 guidelines and study hard as the examinations are just days away.

The Lagos State police command has rescued a 45-year-old man identified as Adeyinka Abiodun who attempted to commit suicide on the Third Mainland Bridge. The man in question tried to kill himself over a N500,000 debt he owed a microfinance bank. Bala Elkana, the Lagos police spokesperson, in a statement on Sunday, said the man was saved by an officer while attempting to jump into the Third Mainland lagoon over the weekend. According to the police, the 45-year old collected a N390,000 loan from a microfinance bank in March, which has exceeded N500,000 with accrued interests and was unable to pay back. While attempting to jump into the lagoon around 1:35 p.m. on Friday, he was intercepted by operatives deployed to Third Mainland Bridge and taken to Bariga Police Station for questioning and debriefing. He revealed that the loan was collected with the intent to upgrade his wine retail business, but the business failed and the money not recoverable. Adeyinka holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics and a Masters Degree in Business Administration. The victim is currently attending medical and counselling sessions. The loan, however, was repaid by the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, who was moved with compassion after hearing the story, Elkana added.

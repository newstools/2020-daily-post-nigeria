Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari is in support of the killings in Southern Kaduna. Omokri made the allegation while condemning the persistent killings in Southern Kaduna. In a post on his Facebook page, the former presidential aide wondered why Buhari has not ordered any military operation in Southern Kaduna, despite the persistent killings. He recalled that Operation Python Dance was deployed in the Southeast over the activities of the Indigenous People of Biafra but has failed to do the same in Southern Kaduna. Omokri maintained that Buhari knows how to put an end to the killings in Southern Kaduna if he wanted to. He wrote: “IPOB killed nobody, yet General Buhari sent Operation Python Dance to the Southeast. Herdsmen have killed thousands in S Kaduna, yet no Operation Python Dance is sent there. “That is to show that General Buhari is in full support of the killings in Southern Kaduna! General Buhari was the official Grand Patron of herdsmen before he became President. Google it. “If he wants Southern Kaduna killings to stop today, he knows what to do. That they have not stopped and are instead intensifying, is because that is what Buhari wants. I fear no one!”<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-827146" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200810_164405_521.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="872" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200810_164405_521.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200810_164405_521-248x300.jpg 248w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

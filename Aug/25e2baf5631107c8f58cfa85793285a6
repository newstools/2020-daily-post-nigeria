Big Brother Naija housemate, Nengi, on Sunday said she will find Ozo a Bayelsa wife. Nengi said this when Ozo said he wanted to take her on a trip after the reality show. Ozo, however, said he was not interested in another Bayelsa wife. “I will find you a wife when we leave this place. I will find you someone like me from Bayelsa,” Nengi told Ozo. But Ozo responded, “if I wanted someone else, I would have chosen.” Nengi further stated that, “When we leave the house there will be a lot of girls interested in you and you won’t have my time.” Agreeing that it was a possibility, Ozo insisted he had found something special in her. Nengi had warned Ozo against mistaking their friendship for a love relationship. She had maintained that she would not date anyone in the house but Ozo is still trying and working hard to see if she could change her mind.

The governorship election of the Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has been affirmed by the state’s Governorship Election Tribunal. The tribunal ruled that the petition filed by Owei Woniwei of the Alliance for Democracy, AD, against Diri was incompetent and lacked merit. The three-man panel led by Justice Owodunni took the decision on Saturday. Justice Owodunni ruled that the petitioner failed to prove the allegations of the forged declaration of age and the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) discharged certificate levelled against the Deputy Governor, Senator Lawrence. This is coming about a month after the Supreme Court had dismissed an appeal filed by a former governorship aspirant of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Timi Alaibe, challenging Diri’s candidacy in the November 2019 election.

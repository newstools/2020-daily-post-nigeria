The Ondo State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday, insisted that the resignation of the Deputy Governor, Agboola Ajayi, would not affect their chances of victory in the October 10 governorship election. Ajayi’s resignation from the PDP comes six weeks after he dumped the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). However, in a statement signed by Kennedy Ikantu Peretei, the State Publicity Secretary, the party said it was yet to receive Ajayi’s resignation letter. Peretei said Ajayi’s resignation proved that he (Ajayi) is desperate to become the Governor of Ondo State. According to the statement, “In the days to come, it will dawn on him that he has squandered whatever was remaining in his goodwill with this decision. “However, his exit from the PDP will not affect our prospects of winning the October Gubernatorial Elections this year. The PDP remains solid, strong and more determined than ever before to win the forthcoming governorship elections with a credible and competent candidate in the person of Eyitayo Jegede, SAN.”

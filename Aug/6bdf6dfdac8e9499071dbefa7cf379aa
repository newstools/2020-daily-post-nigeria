Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Prince has advised Vee over her frequent fight with her lover, Neo. Vee and Neo got into an argument on Saturday which had them not talking to each other. Neo, when approached, flared up about the situation and told Ozo he is no longer interested in the relationship. Prince during a conversation with Vee on Sunday morning advised her to compromise in her relationship with Neo and stop the fights. “Understand intolerance and compromise in your relationship. “At the end of the day we have flaws. If you feel he’s doing something you don’t like let him know “Think about if you depend on him so much and make your decision on what you want. You guys just need to have a conversation about your fights,” Prince told Vee.

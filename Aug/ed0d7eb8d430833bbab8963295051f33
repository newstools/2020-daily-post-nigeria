A total of seventeen inmates in the Sokoto Central Custodial centre were granted pardon on Tuesday by Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State. Malam Muhammad Bello, the Governor’s Special Adviser on Media And Public Affairs made this known in a statement on Tuesday. According to him, the pardon was part of the government’s executive powers to decongest prisons and protect inmates from the coronavirus pandemic. Bello said three inmates out of the 17 were serving terms for federal offences while others were held for state offences. The state Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General, Suleiman Usman, SAN, facilitated the processes. The statement read in part: “The pardon takes cognisance of the executive powers vested in the governor to offer mercy to inmates by the 1999 Constitution as amended. ” The gesture is also aimed at enabling the ex-prisoners to reunite with their family members and become decent citizens. ” Their release was also intended to decongest the prison and protect the inmates from being affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. ” The governor advised the pardoned inmates to shun vices and engage in viable ventures that would uplift their living standards. The Attorney General also presented N50,000 cash assistance to each of the pardoned inmates from the state government to set up useful ventures.

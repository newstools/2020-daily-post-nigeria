Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has vowed that Amotekun Corps will not be subsumed under the Nigeria Police or under the guise of community policing. According to Akeredolu who is the Chairman of South West Governors’ Forum, the grassroot security outfit was set up by enabling law, hence its role is to complement the conventional security agencies. The governor spoke while appearing on Channels TV breakfast programme, Sunrise Daily on Wednesday. Akeredolu noted that the relationship between the Nigeria Police and Amotekun corps was to partner in securing the people and their property. “We have a President who has a listening ear, if IG is not ready to listen to us, we will go and meet the President; we will continue to make the case, we will not collapse Amotekun into community policing.” He, however, noted that the Inspector General of Police should call for a discussion on the need for collaboration between the two security outfits, rather than collapsing Amotekun which was being backed by law, into community policing strategy.

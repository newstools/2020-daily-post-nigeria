Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Tolanibaj has revealed that she did not use the duvet at the Head of House, HoH, lounge because there was ‘cum stain’ on it. Tolanibaj, who was the Deputy Head of House last week, revealed this during a conversation with Wathoni on Tuesday. Wathoni had asked her why there was a missing duvet in their room. She said, “Nengi changed the duvet because it was messed up with cum stains. “The only reason I couldn’t use the duvet in the HOH room was because it was dirty. There were ‘cum stains’ on it.” Tolanibaj last week received a strike for not sleeping at the Head of House, HOH lounge. Before Tolanibaj became Deputy HOH, Erica and Kiddwaya had shared the room alone for a week. Recall that Kiddwaya had clarified that the video with Erica under the duvet was not a sex tape as the viewers did not see what happened.

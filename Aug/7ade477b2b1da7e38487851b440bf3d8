Troops of the Operation Safe Haven, OPSH, have been commended over the arrest of eight suspects in connection with the killings in the Kaduna South Senatorial District. Recall that Major General Chukwuemeka Okonkwo, Commander of OPSH, through the Sector Commander of the OPSH, Sector 7, Colonel David Nwankonobi, who paraded the suspects in Kafanchan on Monday, said the arrest was part of their efforts to curtail the killings in the region. Items such as locally-fabricated pump action guns, locally made pistols, 9 mm ammunition, machetes, and motorcycles were recovered from the bandits. Reacting to the development, the Global Peace and Life Rescue Initiative, GOPRI, said it was highly elated that the painstaking and tireless efforts being put by OPSH and other security agencies to arrest the ugly situation in Southern Kaduna had started to yield positive results. The group, in a statement, Monday, by its Executive Director, Amb. Melvin Ejeh, said the success was a step towards ending the attacks and isolated killings in the area. He said he was optimistic that given the development, the end to the persistent attacks and isolated killings in the area was near. GOPRI said it was not surprised at the latest achievements of the security agencies given the relentless efforts being put by Operation Safe Haven in keeping not just Southern Kaduna but also the Plateau and OPSH’s Area of Responsibility, safe. The group thanked President Muhammad Buhari and the military authorities in establishing OPSH to oversee Southern Kaduna, Plateau and environs, saying it had to a large extent lived up to its responsibility. The group particularly thanked the OPSH Commander, Major General Chukwuemeka Okonkwo for what it called “his relentless efforts and genuine commitment” to seeing to the end of the crises that have seen many lives and property lost.

Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State has insisted that President Muhammadu Buhari must know the truth about the security situation in the North East. He maintained that there is sabotage in the system that will not allow terrorists to stop operating in the region. The Governor spoke on Sunday during a meeting with his counterparts from Kebbi and Jigawa States, Atiku Bagudu and Badaru Abubakar, respectively who paid him a solidarity visit over the recent attack in Baga. The Governor said some elements are trying to frustrate the effort of the Buhari government in ending terrorism, adding that Buhari needs to know the truth. He said, “Let me also re-echo my previous position with respect to the level of insurgency in Borno State, I earlier said that the gravity of the insurgency cannot be compared with what has happened between 2011 to 2015, and 2015 to date. Yes, it’s true. The President has done well. “But there’s sabotage in the system that will not allow insurgency to end; the President has to know this very important point. “When he came to Maiduguri two months ago, I said so because between 2011 to 2015, at a time, almost about 22 LGAs were under the insurgents.” He lamented that out of the four roads that lead to the State capital, Maiduguri, only one was functional. Zulum urged Buhari to examine the security situation in the North East critically, to ensure the effort of the current administration was not in vain.

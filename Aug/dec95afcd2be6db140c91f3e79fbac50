The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has threatened to suspend Edo and Ondo governorship elections. INEC warned that this would happen if a breakdown of law and order occurred. Festus Okoye, INEC Commissioner for Information announced this on Thursday in Abuja. NAN reports that he spoke after a meeting with stakeholders. INEC said it was concerned about aggressive actions and incendiary statements by political parties, candidates and their supporters. He condemned the destruction of opponents’ campaign materials, violent campaigns and use of offensive language. “It is important for political parties, candidates and their supporters to keep in mind that there are extant laws and regulations that must be adhered to during campaigns.” The electoral body warned politicians not to underestimate its resolve to enforce the rules and apply appropriate sanctions. Okoye reminded parties that Edo and Ondo polls would hold at a time of a global pandemic. The official noted that the elections have strict constitutional timelines and threats of or actual violence can disrupt the process and create a constitutional crisis. He hinted that INEC will continue to engage stakeholders in the two states on the need for free, fair, safe and peaceful elections. Okoye warned that the commission will view gravely any disruptive actions by political actors.

The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has lambasted the University of Lagos (UNILAG) Governing Council Chairman, Wale Babalakin. ASUU told him that the hire and fire of a Vice-Chancellor was not his sole right. The council had sacked UNILAG VC, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe and named Prof. Theophilus Omololu Soyombo (Faculty of Social Sciences) as replacement. Reacting, the Committee of VC condemned the removal, calling it a “hatchet job”. ASUU President, Biodun Ogunyemi, at a news conference in Abuja on Tuesday insisted that due process was not followed. “We are shocked not because we regard Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe as a saint but for the fact that all available evidence indicates that he was not taken through the due process. “For the avoidance of doubt, Babalakin should be reminded that the knowledge of procedures and process for appointment and removal of Vice-Chancellors is not the exclusive preserve of legal luminaries,” NAN quoted him as saying. The “legal luminaries” was a veiled description of Babalakin, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN).

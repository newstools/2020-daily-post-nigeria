Manchester United is reportedly lining up a shock move for Juventus winger, Douglas Costa. DAILY POST recalls that Juventus is keen to sell Costa this summer. The Serie A champions have already set a price tag for the Brazilian international. According to Corriere Dello Sport, Man United have made contact with Costa’s representatives about a possible transfer for the Brazilian international. The report added that the Red Devils also made a £27million bid for the 29-year-old, but Juventus is holding out for £36million. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side see Costa as a cheaper alternative to £108m Borussia Dortmund winger, Jadon Sancho. Costa, who will be 30 in September, has not really impressed at Juventus since the Turin club made his signing permanent in 2018. He scored ten goals and provided 21 assists in 101 games for Juventus. His contract with Juventus will expire in 2022.

A South African man identified as West Mathewson, has been mauled to death by two white lions in his lodge. The 69-year-old was killed by two of his lions during a walk on Wednesday morning around the game lodge that he ran, South African police confirmed. Mathewson was dead with multiple injuries at the time the police and emergency services arrived at his lodge, NAN reports. “The deceased walked about with these lions on the game farm. “It looks like the lions were used to him, but the police often advise people always to be wary of wild animals regardless of the circumstances under which they are kept,”Brigadier Motlafela said. Photos on the website of the Lion Tree Game Lodge showed visitors photographed posing with the lions. The lions have been relocated to another game lodge till further notice, police added. Matthewson’s daughter-in-law, Tehri said the cause of his death will be revealed “When we have the results of the autopsy. ‘We have to realise, West was not as young as he thought he was. We are still not sure what actually happened but there was very rough play.”

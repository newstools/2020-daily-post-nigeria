Former Chelsea striker, Chris Sutton, has accused Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang of “cheating” during the Gunners’ FA Cup 2-1 victory against Frank Lampard’s Chelsea on Saturday. Aubameyang scored two goals as Mikel Arteta’s side defeated Chelsea at Wembley. The Arsenal striker got in behind Chelsea captain, Cesar Azpilicueta, and went down in the box before picking himself up off the turf to slot past goalkeeper Willy Caballero to level up proceedings after Christian Pulisic’s opener. But Sutton claimed the Gabonese international “dived” during the encounter to win a penalty against Chelsea. “Let’s not mess around,” Sutton told BBC Five Live. “It was a dive [for the penalty]. It’s cheating. He added: “There is a little pull. There is the slightest contact. He has bought that penalty!”

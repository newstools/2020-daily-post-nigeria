President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated Akinwunmi Adesina over his re-election as the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB). Adesina was re-elected as President of AfDB for a second tenure on Thursday by the bank’s Board. Reacting, Buhari said Adesina deserved the feat. In a statement signed by his spokesman, the President urged Adesina to remain focused and steadfast in pursuing the noble goals of making life better for Africans through various development plans, already captured as High 5s. The statement reads: “News of the victory came during the Council of State meeting, which was attended by former heads of state, Senate President, governors, some Ministers, and senior government officials. “As Secretary to Government of the Federation, Mr Boss Mustapha, announced the good news, President Buhari led a round of applause, and declared: “He deserves it.” Buhari extended appreciation to the African Union for its endorsement of the AfDB President much earlier, and to shareholders of the bank who worked tirelessly to ensure the return of the visionary leader. The President expressed the belief that Dr. Adesina’s “versatility, experience at both national and international engagements, will be further deployed to energize the pan-African financial institution.” Buhari rejoiced with family, friends and professional colleagues of Dr Adesina over the re-election, while commending members of staff and Board of Governors of the AfDB for their consistent support for the former Nigerian Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, and his management team. While pledging full support of his government to ensure a successful tenure for the AfDB leadership, President Buhari prayed for continuous strength for Dr Adesina and his team for a greater good to the continent.

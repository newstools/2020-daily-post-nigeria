Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, tried and failed in his bid to persuade Willian to remain at the club, according to SportsMail. Willian has now agreed to a three-year deal with the Gunners worth Â£100,000-per-week. The 31-year-old turned down several offers from the Blues to remain at Stamford Bridge and is set to end his seven-year stay with the club. Lampard was, however, keen to retain Willian and pleaded with the Chelsea board to try and reach a deal. But his pleas fell on deaf ears. But Willian will leave for the Emirates as a free agent after their Champions League campaign is over. The switch is expected to be officially announced by both parties later this month.

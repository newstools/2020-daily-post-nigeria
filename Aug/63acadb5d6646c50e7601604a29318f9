Atletico Madrid are prepared to offer one of three players to Arsenal, in a swap deal for Alexandre Lacazette, Marca reports. The LaLiga club is interested in signing Lacazette this summer, but financing a straight cash deal could prove difficult. Arsenal are keen on landing Thomas Partey from Atletico, but the Ghana midfielder is not one of the players Diego Simeone is willing to let go. Thomas Lemar, Angel Correa or Vitolo are the players available for the part exchange. Lemar has been monitored by Arsenal previously, and they almost signed the French winger in 2017. Both Correa and Vitolo play in a similar forward role as Lemar and would perhaps be more attractive options to Mikel Arteta. Arsenal rejected the offer back in January though and are under no pressure to sell Lacazette, who still has just under two years remaining on his current contract.

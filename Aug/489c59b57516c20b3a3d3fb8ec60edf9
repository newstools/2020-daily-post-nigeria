The Vice President Prof. Yemi Osinbajo has urged those who have concerns about the recently-signed Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 2020 to approach the National Assembly. He said such persons can get possible amendments, since “We are in a democracy.” Prof. Osinbajo spoke at the ongoing Nigeria Bar Association Annual General Conference during a Special Conversation. He said “we have a process by which this can be redressed. Whatever the proposal for amendment may be, whatever the view of the leadership of the church may be, regarding the question of how the trustees, whether they are interim trustees or not, can be put into a proposal that will be brought to the National Assembly for consideration for an amendment to the law, that is the process which is entirely opened and ought to be pursued. “We are in a democracy and there is a process by which things can be done and that process is the one where you bring forward amendments to the National Assembly and they will do whatever is considered useful in the circumstance.”

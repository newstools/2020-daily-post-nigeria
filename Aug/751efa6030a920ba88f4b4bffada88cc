Femi Fani-Kayode has reacted to the controversies generated over the disinvitation of the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai by the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA. Fani-Kayode, who is also a lawyer, noted that the Governor’s withdrawal as one of the guest speakers at the NBA annual general conference, is now being given religious colouration. He said the decision by the NBA National Executive Committee, NEC, is resulting in a clash between Christians and Muslims in the country. Recall that El-Rufai’s invitation to speak on the topic: ‘Who is a Nigerian?’ met a heavy resistance from members of the association, leading to his disinvitation. His inclusion led to outrage and backlash, even on social media. And the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), had described the NBA’s decision as parochial, myopic and jejune, instructing muslim lawyers not to participate in the event. Also the Muslim Lawyers Association of Nigeria (MULAN) in Kaduna State had shunned participation in the NBA, Annual General Conference, AGC, in protest against El-Rufai’s withdrawal. In reaction to this, Fani-Kayode tweeted, “Can someone please explain to me how the withdrawal of an invitation to speak at an event held by an association of learned men and seasoned professionals ends up degenerating into a Christian versus Muslim matter? “This is not only shameful but is also a grave indictment on us all.”

Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has reacted to the revelation by Mailafia Obadiah, former presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress, ADC, on Boko Haram. Obadiah, who is a former deputy governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, had alleged that Boko Haram was headed by a Northern governor, though he did not disclose the name of the governor. He had alleged that a repentant Boko Haram Commander had told him that the insurgents were in the Southern part of the country and were plotting a civil war in 2022. Obadiah also claimed that the terrorists planned to invade and kill prominent Nigerians in their residence in urban cities. Reacting to Obadiah’s revelation, Kanu wondered what the Southern part of the country gains from being in a country where people of the region are waiting to be slaughtered by Boko Haram members. In a tweet, the IPOB leader wrote: “Former CBN Deputy Gov reveals that a Northern governor is the Commander of BokoHaram & that they’re in the South already waiting for orders to begin the Great Slaughter. Let me again ask the South: What are you gaining from this escalating pain & suffering called #OneNigeria?”

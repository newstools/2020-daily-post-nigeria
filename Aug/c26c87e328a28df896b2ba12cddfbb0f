New Barcelona manager, Ronald Koeman, has decided that Luis Suarez, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba will not be part of his first-team plans. Koeman will inform the three senior players that they can leave, according to AS. The 57-year-old replaced Quique Setien this week and is keen to sort out his squad ahead of preseason. Barcelona is looking to overhaul the team and president, Josep Bartomeu, has named just seven ‘untouchable’ players in the first team. They are Lionel Messi, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Frenkie de Jong, Clement Lenglet and Nelson Semedo, while big-money flops Antoine Griezmann and Ousmane Dembele will also be given another chance to turn their Camp Nou careers around. Koeman is believed to have added Gerard Pique to that list, as he views the defender as a central part of his backline. The Dutchman however wants to offload Suarez, Busquets and Alba, who are all over the age of 30.

Manchester United are still determined to sign Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund this summer, ESPN reports. However the Red Devils have failed to agree personal terms with the 20-year-old and negotiate an agent fee with his representative. United have been given permission by Dortmund to speak to Sancho and his representative, although direct contact between the two clubs has been limited as a result of the impasse with the player’s camp. The Premier League side are confident of reaching a deal with Dortmund, if it gets to the stage of negotiating a transfer fee. However, so far, they have failed to agree terms with Sancho’s camp over the player’s wages. The fee demanded by Sancho’s agent to negotiate the deal is also too high for United. United boss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has made Sancho, who left Manchester City for Dortmund in an £8million transfer in August 2017, his top transfer target this summer.

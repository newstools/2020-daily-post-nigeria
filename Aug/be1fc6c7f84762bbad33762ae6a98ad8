Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq of Kwara State, has approved N17.7m for the renovation of the secretariat office complex of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, in Ilorin. Rafiu Ajakaye, spokesman of the governor, announced to the leadership of the state council of the union in Ilorin. The renovation is expected to be completed in three months, Ajakaye disclosed. Governor Abdulrazaq in January, 2020, paid an unscheduled historic visit to the secretariat complex following a ‘Save-Our-Soul’ message to him by the leadership of the council, promising to assist the union. His visit was followed by series of inspections by officials of the state Ministry of Works, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, and experts from private firms to assess the level of structural defects following which recommendations were made. The secretariat complex, located on Offa road, Ilorin, the state capital, houses office accommodation, conference hall, chalets, generator house and restaurants. It was handed over to the council by the state government in September 2013, as compensation for the revocation of the union’s former secretariat on which the state banquet hall is now situated. The council’s chairman, Umar Abdulwahab and the Secretary, Deacon Omotayo Ayanda, in a statement in Ilorin, said the secretariat, had continued to experience various structural defects, including cracked walls and leaking roofs, resulting in damages of computer sets, office furniture and fittings. The council appreciated the governor’s fulfilled promise and providing an enabling environment for journalists in the state. DAILY POST reports that the renovation would cover roof and ceiling works, masonry works, wall maintenance and mechanical and drainage works. Others include electrical maintenance, metal work, entrance slabs, window fixed, light maintenance, painting works and post construction cleaning among others.

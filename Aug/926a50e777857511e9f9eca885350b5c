There was drama in the Osun House of Assembly, on Monday, as a member of the parliament, Adekunle Oyekunle, representing Ejigbo disowned Governor Gboyega Oyetola’s nominee. It was gathered that Governor Oyetola had sent a letter to the House two weeks ago, nominating a former Senior Special Assistant on Legal Matters under Aregbesola administration, Adebayo Salmon, from Ejigbo Local Government of the state, for screening as a member of Judicial Service Commission. The letter was read by the Speaker, Hon Timothy Owoeye at the penal on Monday. Requested by the Speaker of the House to give an assessment of the nominee, the lawmaker representing the same local government with the nominee, disowned the Oyetola’s nominee. Hon Adekunle said he is concerned about the availability of the nominee in discharging his duty when approved. It was gathered that the nominee, Adebayo did not familiarise himself with the lawmaker, Hon Adekunle who is representing his constituency. A reliable source inside the Parliamentary complex told DAILY POST that it was the politics being played between the faction of the immediate past Speaker of the house, Hon Najeem Salaam and the ex-Federal House of Representatives lawmaker, Prof Mojeed Alabi, who hailed from the Ejigbo. The Speaker declared an hour break session, which according to a source, he consequently made calls to the affected sides.

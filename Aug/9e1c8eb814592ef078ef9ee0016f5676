The ‘F’ Divisional Police station, in Ilorin the Kwara State, has rescued a robbery suspect who allegedly killed an unidentified Hausa Okada rider, with the intention of robbing him of his motorcycle. DAILY POST gathered that colleagues of the late Okada rider gave the robbery suspect a hot chase following the discovery of the crime at Tanke area in the state capital at about 2pm. The robbery suspect during the chase, reportedly dashed to the ‘F’ Divisional Police station at Tanke to avoid being lynched by the angry Okada riders who numbered more than 20. The Hausa colleagues of the late Okada rider created a rowdy scene at the police station but police operatives brought the situation under control. Three police patrol vehicles were deployed to convey the suspect to the state police command headquarters under the escort of the aggrieved Okada riders calling for justice. A source at the police station told DAILY POST that the suspect was ferried to the state police command following a directive “from above.” When contacted, the spokesman of the police command, SP Okasanmi Ajayi, said: ” I am yet to get the details Sir, I will confirm if I have the details.” But he was yet to respond at the time of this report.

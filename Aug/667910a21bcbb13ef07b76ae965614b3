Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has condemned Thursday’s incident at the House of Assembly. He declared that the action of the lawmakers was a coup and treasonable. The governor noted that the inauguration of the lawmakers was an “illegal assault on our democracy.” Obaseki stated that former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, was bent on throwing the state into crisis. Edo has been in turmoil ahead of the September 19 governorship election. In a broadcast on Friday, Obaseki said the attempt to invade the assembly complex “had all the hallmarks of an attempted coup d’état.” He warned that persons “who set out to test our will in this regard will meet with the full wrath of the law.” Obaseki observed that the people of Edo State rose as one to prevent the desecration of democracy. He expressed worry that some individuals were willing to plunge the society into avoidable anarchy and conflict just to satisfy their illegitimate objectives. “This unfortunate situation has festered because a former governor of the state is bent on throwing the state into crisis ahead of the forthcoming governorship elections. ”The government will take all steps necessary to defend the rule of law and democratic ideals,” Obaseki announced.

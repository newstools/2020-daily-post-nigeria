This year’s Europa League final will be played between Sevilla and Inter Milan on Friday, August 21. Sevilla has a reputation in Europe’s second-tier competition, having won it five times out of the six finals they featured in. The LaLiga giants beat Manchester United and Wolverhampton Wanderers to qualify. On the other hand, Inter thrashed Shakhtar Donetsk 5-0 in the one-legged semi-final. Antonio Conte’s men have reached the final, after getting dumped out from the Champions League group stage. Unlike Sevilla, Inter is looking to win its first European silverware in 10 years. Today’s clash will be the first-ever meeting between the two clubs in European competition, but Sevilla has won their last three games against Italian opposition. Kick-off is 8pm West African time.

FIFA has taken the decision to cancel the international break for all confederations except UEFA, “in response to the global disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.” This will see the dates moved from August 31 to September 8 this year to January 24 to February 1 of 2021. The Super Eagles of Nigeria were scheduled to play two friendly matches next month, with head coach, Gernot Rohr admitting that they were waiting on FIFA’s decision. However, the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers will resume in November. The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has confirmed its compliance with the shift in dates. “For Cameroon 2021, the qualifiers resume on 9-17 November 2020 with the Day 3 and 4 matches whilst the penultimate and ultimate matches take place on 22-30 March 2021,” a CAF statement read. In March, CAF postponed upcoming AFCON qualifying matches due to COVID-19. The qualifiers were scheduled to kick off from March 25-31.

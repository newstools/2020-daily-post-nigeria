Praise Nelson, the most recent evicted lockdown housemate, has said he was not surprised that last week’s Head of House, Kiddwaya picked Wathoni over him (Praise). Praise also revealed that Biggie projects every other thing happening in the house apart from when housemates are having their “shower hour.” Praise has been on media tour since last Sunday when he evicted from the Big brother Naija lockdown house. Asked if he received with shock the fact that Kiddwaya chose Wathoni over him during the Sunday live eviction, Praise said, “No. I wasn’t surprised. I wasn’t surprised at all.” Asked to disclose one thing viewers would be surprised to know happened in the house, Praise said, “I don’t know. I can’t tell. I feel like everything was seen. Okay like when we were in the shower…like our shower hour. Asked if things happened during the shower hour, he said “Nothing basically happened then. I don’t think there’s anything that wasn’t projected [apart from the shower hour).” Praise became the sixth housemate to leave the lockdown house following his eviction on Sunday. He joined Lilo, Ka3na, Eric, Tochi and Kaisha, who were earlier evicted from the reality show.

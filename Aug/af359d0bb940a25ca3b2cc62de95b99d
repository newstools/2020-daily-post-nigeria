No fewer than five persons have been confirmed dead in a fatal accident that occurred along the Lagos-Ibadan highway, after Sagamu interchange, in Ogun State. DAILY POST reports that the deceased were reportedly crushed to death by a fuel tanker, as one other person sustained injury in the ugly incident. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps, has confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. TRACE spokesman, Babatunde Akinbiyi, said the accident occurred on Thursday, involved three vehicles – one space bus, one DAF tanker and one BENZ truck. Akinbiyi blamed the road crash on reckless driving and wrongful overtaking, on the part of the Mazda space bus driver. “We learnt from the eye witness account that the space bus and a tanker were inbound Ibadan from Lagos along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway at the diversion axis after Sagamu interchange, when in an attempt to overtake a truck in front of it, had a head-on collision with another truck coming from Ibadan, inbound Lagos,” Akinbiyi said. This, according to him, kicked the bus under the tanker before veering into the bush killing 5 people on the spot. Eight persons – five men and three women, were involved in the multiple accidents. The TRACE PRO informed that three women, one man died in the space bus, while one person in the truck gave up the ghost in the hospital. The injured victim was said to have been taken to Idera Hospital, Sagamu; while the dead victims were deposited at the morgue of the same hospital.

A cleric, Bishop Godfrey Onah, has blamed Christians in the National Assembly (NASS), for the recent passage of the 2020 Companies and Allied Matters Bill (CAMA), signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. Onah, who is of the Nsukka Catholic Diocese, said in a remark during the Sunday Mass that if Christians in NASS had opposed the bill, it would not have been passed into law. President Muhammadu Buhari had on Aug. 7, signed the CAMA bill into law, giving provision for religious bodies and charity organisations to be regulated by the registrar of the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), and a supervising minister. “The question many Christians have been asking is, where are Christian legislators during the debate of this bill and its passage in the National Assembly? “Because, if they had opposed this bill on the floor of the house, it would not have been passed and sent to the president for assent.
“I blame Christian legislators for doing nothing and allowing the passage of the 2020 CAMA Act,” he said. Onah, however, wondered what the Federal Government wanted to achieve in monitoring how the finances of churches in the country are managed when it contributed no dime to the church, NAN reports. “Government should focus and monitor its ministries, agencies and other government institutions where it budgets billions of Naira annually and not church offerings. “Had it been that the government gave allocations to churches and decided to monitor its usage, nobody will question the government,” he said.

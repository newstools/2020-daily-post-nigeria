Former Ogun State Governor, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, has expressed gladness that he was able to forgive late Buruji Kashamu, before he died. It will be recalled that Daniel and Kashamu were once at loggerheads with each other over the soul of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun State. In 2011, Kashamu aligned with Former President Olusegun Obasanjo to ‘fight’ Daniel, ensuring that his anointed candidates lost out in the party’s primary elections. At the time, Obasanjo supported Chief Tunji Olurin, while Daniel, who was the incumbent governor of Ogun then, wanted Prince Gboyega Isiaka to succeed him. With the PDP tickets eluding them, Isiaka and other candidates loyal to Daniel defected to the Peoples Party of Nigeria (PPN). However, both the PDP and the PPN lost the 2011 election to Senator Ibikunle Amosun of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN). Things later fell apart between Kashamu and former President Obasanjo. Reacting to Kashamu’s death, Daniel said he received with shock, the news of the death of Kasamu. “I picked a Timeless lesson of how transient life can be from this sad occurrence. I am glad despite all our years of political disagreements, conflicts and turbulence, by the hands of Providence my heart found a rare opportunity of forgiving and making up with him before his untimely death,” Daniel said. He prayed God his family the fortitude to bear the loss.

The Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, has reacted to the endorsement of Osagie Ize-Iyamu, All Progressives Congress, APC, governorship candidate by President Muhammadu Buhari. Obaseki said it was disappointing and a dilemma that Buhari could endorse Ize-Iyamu despite facing trial for corruption to the tune of N700m. Speaking through his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie, Obaseki sympathised with Buhari over the endorsement. A statement by Osagie said Buhari only endorsed Ize-Iyamu in the interest of APC. The statement reads: “President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday was confronted with a dilemma of no mean proportion, to raise the hand of Osagie Ize-Iyamu, candidate of the APC in the September 19 gubernatorial election taking place in Edo State. “The President was constrained to carry out the action, which indeed was a dilemma. “We sympathise with the President, who reluctantly handed the APC candidate, the party’s flag and unveiled him behind closed doors.” Buhari had endorsed Ize-Iyamu during a meeting some leaders of the APC at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. At the meeting, the president had appealed to the party leaders to work towards Ize-Iyamu’s victory during the elections. Obaseki and Ize-Iyamu are the leading contenders in the September 19 governorship election in the state.

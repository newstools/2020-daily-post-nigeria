The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has called on Adams Oshiomhole, a former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, to show to the public his primary school-leaving certificate. Dan Orbih, Chairman of PDP’s campaign council in Edo State, said Oshiomhole should present his primary school certificate to prove that he went to primary school. Orbih issued the challenge while addressing PDP members at Ososo and Dangbala wards in Akoko-Edo Local Government Area of Edo State. He also charged the former APC National Chairman to reveal the real cause of the misunderstanding between him and the state Governor, Godwin Obaseki. According to Orbih: “They said Governor Godwin Obaseki who graduated from the University of Ibadan has a Certificate. I’m bold to say that I challenge Adams Oshiomhole to show us his primary six certificates. “He should allow Edo people to decide who governs them. In four years, Godwin Obaseki has done more than what Oshiomhole did in eight years.”

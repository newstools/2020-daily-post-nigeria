Barcelona striker Luis Suarez is unhappy at the club’s decision to listen to offers for him this summer transfer window. DAILY POST had earlier reported that Barcelona put Suarez up for sale with other senior players after their Champions League’s exit at the hands of Bayern Munich on Friday. However, according to Spanish outlet, OKDiario, Suarez is angry at Barcelona for putting him up for sale. Suarez has no intention of leaving Camp Nou this summer but is aware changes will be made, with Barcelona head coach, Quique Setien likely to be sacked in the coming days. The Uruguay international is annoyed because he feels he has been an asset to the Catalan club, unlike flops signings Antoine Griezmann, Philippe Coutinho and Ousmane Dembele. Suarez has been impressive for the La Liga giants since he joined Barcelona from Liverpool in 2014. The 33-year-old has established himself as a club legend, with only Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi scoring more goals than him for the club in their entire history. He has been a big part of Barcelona’s success in recent years, helping them reign supreme in the Champions League under Luis Enrique and also winning four La Liga titles throughout his spell in Catalonia. Now, Barcelona is willing to get him loose this summer.

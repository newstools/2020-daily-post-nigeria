The All Progressives Congress (APC) has congratulated the Governor of Kogi State on the affirmation of his election by the Supreme Court. In a unanimous judgment on Monday, a seven-member panel of the apex court led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Tanko Mohammed, dismissed for lack of merit the appeals filed by governorship candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and Social Democratic Party (SDP). Reacting, APC’s spokesman, Yekini Nabena, commended the Supreme Court for defending the votes and mandate of Kogi people. A statement by Nabena reads: “The APC hails the Supreme Court for defending the votes and mandate the good people of Kogi State overwhelmingly gave Governor Yahaya Bello to lead them for another four years. “This victory will definitely buoy Governor Bello to focus on his administration’s commendable effort to ensure peace and guarantee security for the people of the state. Kogi State under Governor Bello is already one of the frontline states leading the agricultural revolution. We call on all stakeholders holders to support the government in achieving the ongoing developmental initiatives which will improve the fortunes of the state and people.”

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemate, Erica, has given reason for choosing Kiddwaya over Laycon as Deputy Head of House. Erica, who is in a love triangle with Laycon and Kiddwaya, won Head of House for this week. This gave her immunity from eviction this week alongside her deputy who would also have access to the luxury room. She chose Kiddwaya as Deputy and snubbed Laycon who she is mentally attracted to. Giving her reason for picking Kiddwaya, Erica said it is not healthy to chose Laycon to share the room with her. Speaking to Kiddwaya, she said, “ I’m 100 per cent sure the person that probably cares about me the most in this house is Laycon but I do not think it’s healthy for the both of us to share a room. “That was why I chose you as Deputy Head of House.” The situation is, Erica understands that Laycon cares about her the most in the house but she doesn't feel the same way about him. Here, she explain to Kiddwaya why she snubbed Laycon #bbnaija2020lockdown #bbnaija2020 #BBNaija pic.twitter.com/NqwRAzPCGS — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 10, 2020

Former Liverpool midfielder, Graeme Souness, has named Manchester City as now the ‘outstanding favourites’ team to win the Champions League this season. Man City will tackle Lyon in the Champions League ‘final eight’ fixture in Lisbon on Friday after they eliminated Real Madrid from the competition last Thursday. “I expect Manchester City to blow Lyon away in the quarter-final and they are the outstanding favourites now to win it [Champions League trophy],” Souness told The Times. “Guardiola will have to be wary of his former clubs in the semi-final, whether it is Bayern or Barça waiting for City there. “If Lionel Messi has a special night, Barcelona can beat anyone. Bayern are streets ahead of everyone else in Germany and have already blown away a couple of English teams this year in Tottenham and Chelsea. “On the other side of the draw, I reckon Paris Saint-Germain will come up short again, and Atletico Madrid could be the greatest danger. “They had some luck against Liverpool – in a tie that was completed before lockdown – but were dogged and organised.”

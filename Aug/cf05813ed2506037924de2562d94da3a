A Senator representing Akwa Ibom Northwest, Chris Ekpenyong, has advocated for Igbo presidency in 2023. Ekpeyong said Igbo presidency would help deepen national unity and give people of the Southeast a sense of belonging in Nigeria. Speaking in Uyo, the state capital, Ekpenyong said all zones of the country deserve an opportunity to produce Nigeria’s president. He said the Southeast should be allowed to produce Nigeria’s president like other regions of the country. According to Ekpenyong: “My prayer is that we should allow an Igbo man to become the next president of Nigeria. “If the North and the South West have produced a president, why can’t the Southeast be allowed to become president of Nigeria? “Igbo presidency is the path that will lead to deepening our national unity. It will assuage the feeling of disillusionment among the Igbo. It will also give them a sense of belonging. No section has the monopoly of capacity to lead Nigeria.” Ekpenyong’s remark comes at a time when the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai had said the South should produce Nigeria’s next president.

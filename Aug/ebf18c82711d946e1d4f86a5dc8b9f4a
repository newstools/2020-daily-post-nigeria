Jurgen Klopp has reiterated his plan to walk away from football and take at least one year off, after his contract expires at Liverpool. The German is contracted to the Premier League champions until 2024. He only signed an extension in December, 2019. But Klopp has not ruled out that it was his final contract in football. When asked what he will do after 2024, Klopp told German publication SportBuzzer: “I will take a year off and ask myself if I miss football. “If I say no, then that will be the end of coach Jurgen Klopp. “If one day, I am no longer a manager, there is one thing I will not miss: the brutal tension immediately before the game.” Klopp had planned to take a year off after leaving Borussia Dortmund in 2015, but could not turn down Liverpool. He then replaced Brendan Rodgers in October that year and has gone on to win the Champions League and their first title in 30 years.

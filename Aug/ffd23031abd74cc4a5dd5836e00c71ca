Former President, Olusegun Obasanjo has urged Nigerian youths to take up leadership positions. He expressed confidence that this would revamp the country’s education sector. The former Nigerian leader spoke on Saturday at the virtual 2020 Graduation Ceremony of “Teach for Nigeria Fellows”. Obasanjo stated that over 14 million children were out of school. “They are deprived of opportunities that will allow them to develop their abilities and become useful to themselves and their communities,” he noted. He said to transform the education system “in a sustainable way, Nigerian youths must take up leadership positions.” The Owu-born statesman declared: “Please do not let anybody tell you that you are leaders of tomorrow, you are leaders today.” Obasanjo charged youths to lead innovative solutions at every level of the society and across different sectors. On the coronavirus pandemic, he advised that all hands be on deck as the world strives to fight the disease and develop a vaccine. “So far, the damage in Africa has been moderate; but if we relax, the African continent can become the worst affected from the economic fallout of the crisis,” Obasanjo said.

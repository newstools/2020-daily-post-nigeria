A 30-year-old musician, Yahaya Sharif-Aminu has been sentenced to death by hanging by an Upper Shari’a Court sitting in Kano State. The trial Judge, Khadi Muhammad Ali-Kani, sentenced Sharif-Aminu to death by hanging for blasphemy. Sharif-Aminu, a resident of Sharifai Quarters of Kano Municipal, was arraigned by the police on one-count charge of inciting religious creed. This, the police said was contrary to section 382 (6) of Kano State Sharia Panel Code Law 2000. The Prosecution, Insp. Aminu Yar-Goje, informed the court that the musician committed the offence February 28.

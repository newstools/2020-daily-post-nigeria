Following the order by Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Adamu, for a nationwide clampdown on the proliferation of prohibited firearms, the Commissioner of Police, FCT Command, Bala Ciroma, has constituted a team to enforce the directive in Abuja. DSP Anjuguri Manzah, FCT Police Public Relations Officer, made the announcement in a statement sent to DAILY POST on Thursday. The committee chaired by the Command’s Deputy Commissioner of Police Operations, Sunday Babaji, has been mandated to work with traditional rulers, Area Commanders, and Divisional Police Officers. They are expected to identify, isolate, disarm, arrest and prosecute any persons or groups in unlawful possession of prohibited firearms. Ciroma ordered all DPOs in FCT to convene an enlightenment meeting of all vigilante groups, within their respective areas of responsibility. This, he explained, would ensure their activities are in conformity with the extant laws guiding their establishment and operations. “Similarly, individuals or group in unlawful possession of prohibited firearms should voluntarily submit such firearms at the nearest Police Division,” Manzah added. “Reassuring residents of its commitment to protecting lives and property, the command enjoins residents to promptly report to any nearest police station.

The former national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has revealed details of his meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday. In a chat with State House correspondents afterwards, Oshiomhole said Buhari warned against violence in the upcoming governorship election in Edo State. “I briefed him on what is happening. You know his attitude is always clear about the Nigerian electorate, that their rights must always be respected. “Anybody using unlawful weapons, violence to intimidate the electorate, the president will never support such causes. And on that, we are together,” he said. Oshiomhole added that he had run elections in Edo state three times without violence and that “the only thing that has changed is: who is the governor, who boasts of his immunity and so on.” He warned that “the courts are there, the police are there and they will do their job. “It doesn’t matter which party anybody belongs, the laws are the same.”

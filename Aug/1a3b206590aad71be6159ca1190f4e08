President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered the Chairman, Governing Council of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Wale Babalakin and the Vice Chancellor, Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, to step aside. Ben Goong, Director of Public Relations, Federal Ministry of Education, said this in a statement on Friday. Babalakin and Ogundipe were directed to recuse themselves from duty “pending the outcome of the Special Visitation Panel” set up by the president. The governing council had removed Ogundipe and appointed Theophilus Omololu Soyombo of the Faculty of Social Sciences as the Acting VC. The institution’s Senate and unions oppose the sack. The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) accused Babalakin of acting above the law. The Committee of Vice Chancellors of Universities (CVC) called Ogundipe’s removal “a hatchet job”.

Iran has announced readiness to pay compensations for the crashed Ukrainian passenger plane. Touraj Zangeneh, head of Iran’s Civil Aviation Organisation disclosed this to IRNA news agency on Saturday. In January, Iran admitted that its military “unintentionally” shot down the aircraft. The incident occurred amid the new year tension with the United States, the first country to blame Iran. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau confirmed that 63 of the 176 casualties were Canadians. Zangeneh said “Iran has accepted the responsibility for its mistake and therefore the country is ready for negotiations on paying full compensation for what has been done. “Compensations will be paid within international laws and without discrimination. It will include any group that has been affected in the incident.” Iran and Ukraine are scheduled for a new round of talks in October in Tehran. A fortnight ago, Iran’s Minister of Transport, Mohammad Eslami, said the final report on the mishap will be published soon.

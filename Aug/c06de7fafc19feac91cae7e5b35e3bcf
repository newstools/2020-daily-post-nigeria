A voodoo priestess and spiritual leader of Ekutetebite Negwogho group, Princess lnibokun lmasemwenbor, has endorsed the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, for another term. lmasemwenbor said Obaseki would be re-elected because he provided people of the state with social amenities like good roads. She also placed a curse on those opposing Obaseki, saying the ancestors and deities of the state would “torment” those opposing the governor. The voodoo priestess, who was accompanied by her fellow occult members, spoke at the gate of the State House of Assembly complex during an incantation session. She and her members stormed the complex, following the crisis among lawmakers. Stressing that she represented the female members of traditional worship centres in the Benin Kingdom, the voodoo priestess said: “I was at home when I saw on television the crisis at the Edo Assembly. I heard that some people from other ethnic groups are trying to turn Benin upside-down. We Benin people don’t like what they are doing. “APC is oppressing Obaseki. Why I am interested in the matter is that we did not have an access road to my community before Obaseki became governor. We used to spend so much to come to Benin. But now, we can travel in and out of our community. We don’t suffer from erosion anymore. “For that reason, I must support Obaseki for a second term. Whoever says he will turn the state upside down to rig the election, let the heads of our ancestors torment him. “Obaseki is a peacemaker, he gave us amenities of life and for that reason, I have to back him up with my strength. “Nobody will grab it from him and whoever says he will turn the state upside down to subvert the wishes of the people, help us tell him that the head of our ancestors will torment the person. All the deities of the Benin kingdom will torment him or her.”

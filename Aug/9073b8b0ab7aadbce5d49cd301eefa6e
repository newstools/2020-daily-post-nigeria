Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Vee has finally spoken on her fight with Neo on Saturday. The lovers in BBNaija lockdown house on Saturday had an argument over food. This led to Vee and Neo avoiding each other at the Saturday night party. When approached about the situation, Vee told Prince that she is tired of his habit of shouting at her and taking things too serious. She, however, made it clear that she is not going to break up with him like other housemates think but talk things out later. “First it was the food issue then the camera thing too before the party started. “He screamed at me like a dog in my face like he was going to beat me up. “He knew I needed to eat to take my drugs and he made an issue out of it. “I’m not breaking up with him, I would talk to him about our fights later today “It is just annoying we have frequent fight, I’m 24yr old for God sake,” Vee said. Meanwhile, Neo angered by the situation last night told Ozo that he is no longer interested in the relationship with Vee.

Following predictions by NiMET that 2020 will witness heavy rainfall with potential flood threats, the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) North West Zone on Wednesday embarked on a tour of flood-prone areas. The agency has commenced a sensitization of community members on the need to prepare for eventualities. A three-day exercise within Kaduna metropolis saw a combined team of NEMA, Kaduna SEMA, Nigerian Red Cross, Fire Service visit several locations in Chikun and Kaduna North LGAs where flood is annually prevalent. Speaking to newsmen, leader of the NEMA delegation, Hajia Halima Daudu Suleiman reminded the Public that, early this year,
“NIRSA and NMET predicted heavy rainfall and rising water levels. She warned that if residents do not prepare, many houses and properties would be swept away this year due to flood. “We are also looking out for safe areas where we can keep people in case of a flood disaster,” she said. According to her, “for now we are impressed with the communities we have visited. “They have committees and rain gauges, once the water goes up they tell people to get to higher grounds,” she said. She advised people living close to river banks to be on the alert throughout the rainy season to prevent being caught unawares. “People at river banks should not sleep with their both eyes closed. We advise them to move away to higher grounds, till the water recedes,” she advised. Areas visited by NEMA on day one of the tour include; Tesan Farms, Primary Healthcare Centre, and several houses ravaged by flood in Romi Community.

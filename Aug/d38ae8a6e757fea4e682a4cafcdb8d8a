The Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has condemned the alleged killing of Fulani pastoralists in Zuru Sakaba, Fakai and Dango/Wasagu Local Government. The LGs are all under Zuru Emirate Council in Kebbi State. Baba Othman Ngelzarma, MACBAN National Secretary, in a statement on Thursday, said 68 people, including a one-year-old child, were killed. He alleged that the Dakarkari “Yan Sa kai” carried out the murders between April 29 to August, 11 this year 2020. Ngelzarma lamented that no one has been arrested till date. “The first murder took place at the premises of the Technical College ZURU where eight Fulani people were killed. This trend continued in the communities of Danko, Maga, Ribah, Joli, Kadurga, Marafa, Kanya, Unashi and Ayyu, where a total of 68 people perished for no just cause other than being pastoral Fulani.” He recalled that on 11th of April, 2020, Alhaji Kiruwa, a shop owner at the Danko market was killed “for no apparent reasons”. MACBAN alerted that the “murderous gang is getting bolder and bolder by the day and if care is not taken the crises in these areas might snowball into a large conflict.” “Report reaching us said that the “Yan Sa kai” held four policemen hostage in Ribah Division in Danko-Wasagu until their members who were arrested for involvement in the killings are released. They only released the policemen when their conditions were met. “They also went to the Road Safety office in Zuru and forcefully retrieved the vehicles and motorcycles that were impounded by the officers of the Road Safety. We were informed that they shot and wounded a military officer in one of their encounter in Kangon Wasagu.” Ngelzarma urged to the government of Kebbi State and security agencies to arrest and prosecute the culprits. MACBAN appealed to its members to exercise restraint, “because we always believe two wrongs do not make a right.”

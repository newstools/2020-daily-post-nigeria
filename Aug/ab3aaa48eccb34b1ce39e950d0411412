Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate Lucy has spoken about the new voting process for eviction of housemates this season. Big Brother introduced a new twist in this year’s edition where the fate of the bottom four housemates with the least votes lies in the hands of housemates. The new style has been criticised by voters who feel it is unfair to leave the fate of housemates every Sunday in the hand of housemates and not the fans. Lucy speaking during her diary session with Big brother said the process is fair but based on friendship and not weakest individuals. She, however, mentioned that she chooses housemates to be evicted based on their value in the house. Lucy said: “I think housemates are voting based on friendship, not the weakest link. “For now I think this method is good but it can change later. “My approach has been to keep housemates who add value to the house. I saw Ka3na’s eviction coming but didn’t see that of Eric.”

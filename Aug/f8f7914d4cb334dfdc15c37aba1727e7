Former Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Lilo, has expressed regrets over her eviction from the reality show. Lilo was evicted alongside Ka3na during Sunday live eviction. She was shown the exit door after being among the four housemates who got the lowest votes. Most BBNaija viewers blamed her relationship with Eric and constant stay with him as a reason for her low votes. Speaking after her eviction on Monday, Lilo on her Instagram page with heartbreak emojis wrote; ”Wish I can turn back the hands of time.”
Most housemates like Vee during her diary session with Biggie said she voted Lilo out because she did not express herself and make other housemates get to know her personally.

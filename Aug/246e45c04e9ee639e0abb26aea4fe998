James Obori, former Governor of Delta State, has countered allegations by Godswill Akpabio, Minister of Niger Delta, linking him to contract scam in the Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC. Ibori said contrary to Akpabio’s allegation he did not receive any contract from NDDC. Akpabio had named Ibori as one of those who benefitted from the contract racketeering in NDDC. However, the former governor urged Akpabio to “calm down” and focus on carrying out his duties. A statement by Ibori’s Media Assistant, Mr. Tony Eluemunor, said: “On hearing the news of the alleged Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) contract awarded to him this morning, from the former Governor of Akwa-Ibom State, Senator Godswill Akpabio, as published in a newspaper and other online publications, he did not want to join in the ‘dancing in the market square’ going on in the NDDC right now. “He has decided to make this clarification for the records because friends and associates inundated him with phone calls this morning. So, he is stating categorically that he never solicited for, or was awarded, or indeed executed, any contract with NDDC or any government agency, at any time, for that matter. “And in all, he has been through in and out of public office, he has never been accused of being a government contractor, let alone a failed one hence he did not want to dignify the allegation with a response because it is ridiculous. So, Ibori is advising Akpabio, his brother, friend and member of the former Governors Forum, to please calm down and focus on the task at hand.”

Barcelona striker, Luis Suarez, has said he is ready to sit on the bench rather than leave. The club’s president, Josep Bartomeu, this week hinted that many senior players will be allowed to go. Bartomeu also listed ‘untouchable’ squad members but did not include Suarez, who has a contract until 2021. The 33-year-old has now said he is ready to fight for his Barca future. “Throughout my career, I have accepted being on the bench. I still think I have a lot to give but I wouldn’t have any problem if that were to be the case here next season. “Competition for places is healthy and if the new coach [Ronald Koeman] feels I should be a substitute, then I would have no problem with that,” Suarez told El País. Suarez joined Barcelona from Liverpool six years ago and is now their third top goalscorer of all time with 198 goals.

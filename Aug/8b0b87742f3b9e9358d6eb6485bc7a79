Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya, has chosen Tolanibaj as his Deputy Head of House. Kiddwaya emerged Head of House after a game of dice on Monday. Kiddwaya during the weekly HoH task had 25 points, the highest for the day. Prince followed with 23 points while Bright had 18. With this, Kiddwaya has immunity from this week’s possible eviction. However, he could not choose his love interest, Erica because she was last week’s Head of House.

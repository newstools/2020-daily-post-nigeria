The Federal Government has reacted warning that insurgents were penetrating the West African region. DAILY POST had reported that United States Africa Command (US AFRICOM) warned on Tuesday, claimed that the Islamic State (ISIS) and Al-Qaeda terrorist groups are gradually taking over the West African Region after losing ground in Syria, Iraq, etc. Dagvin Anderson, US Commander of the US Special Operations Command, Africa, stated that the insurgents are penetrating through North-Western Nigeria. Reacting, Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, in an interview with TVC, appealed to developed nations to make available the requested platforms it needs to effectively prosecute the war against terrorism and insurgency. Mohammed said the Federal Government had always been alive to its responsibilities in securing the country, adding that security remained the topmost priority of the administration. He urged developed nations to assist the country in the war against insurgency and terrorism by providing the relevant platforms needed. “For instance, for more than two years, we have been waiting for certain platforms from certain countries which they have refused to supply to us. “Even, some countries have refused to give us maintenance on existing platforms. “Fighting terrorism is a global issue and should be global joint efforts. “As much as we are committed to fighting terrorism, we also need the support of the developed countries to release to us some platforms that will make our fight more efficient. “It must be noted that we are not asking them to give us these platforms for free. “As a matter of fact, in many cases, some of them have simply refused to even sell to us for whatever reasons. “Therefore, you cannot at one hand refuse to sell to us effective platforms to fight terrorism and at the same time accuse us of allowing terrorism to run down the continent.”

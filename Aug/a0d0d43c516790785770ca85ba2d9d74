Olusegun Bamgbose, Esq., the National Coordinator, Concerned Advocates for Good Governance, CAGG, has said that world leaders should not stop at condemning the military takeover in Mali but also speak against what led to it. He noted that in as much as no well thinking individual would prefer a military regime, a leader of a democratic system must work towards bettering the lives of the citizens. Bamgbose said this in reaction to the arrests of President and Prime Minister of the Mali on Tuesday by mutiny soldiers. The senior lawyer warned that the Federal Government of Nigeria must look inwards to avoid the pitfalls. According to him, “The military intervention in Mali is no doubt condemnable, and should not in any way be justified. However, bad governance is equally unjustifiable. “A leader, who is not capable of protecting lives and properties of his subjects, and making life better for them, loses his moral rights to govern. “The United Nations and world leaders condemnation of Mali coup, is not enough, they should equally condemn bad governance, corruption and constitutional abuses. “Most of these coups are preventable. Major General Buhari struck in the 80s because of bad governance. “It’s often correctly asserted that, those who make peaceful change impossible, make violent change impossible. “One will expect the world leaders, to periodically assess the performance of leaders of developing countries. “Military intervention is no doubt undesirable, but bad governance should be visibly condemned. There is no alternative to good governance. “FG condemnation of coup in Mali is in order, but the government should look inward and avoid the pitfalls. This nation has more than enough resources to make life better for every citizen.”

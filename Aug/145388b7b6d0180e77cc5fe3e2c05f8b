The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has berated Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, over his attack on a reporter with Daily Trust, Charles Eyo. SERAP said Fani-Kayode should publicly apologize for hurling insults at Eyo who was doing his job. Fani-Kayode had called Eyo “stupid” for asking him what he termed “insulting” question. The incident had occurred during a press conference in Calabar, the Cross River State capital. Reacting, SERAP in a series of tweets said nobody should verbally attack journalists doing their job. “BREAKING: We condemn reported intimidation, harassment and attack on @daily_trust journalist by a former Minister of Aviation Femi Fani-Kayode. Mr Fani-Kayode should publicly apologise to the journalist. “No one should ever call any journalist “stupid” simply for doing their job “Journalistic freedom also covers possible recourse to a degree of exaggeration, or even provocation. The media has a vital role to play as “public watchdog” in imparting information of serious public concern and should not be inhibited or intimidated from playing that role,” SERAP tweeted. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Union of Journalists, NUJ, had condemned Fani-Kayode’s action which it described as “gangster-like.”

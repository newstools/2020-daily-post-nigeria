Police have arrested a village head, Rasheed Sholabi, who is the Baale of Oose Agbedu Ajibawo, in Owode-Yewa area of Ogun State, for having unlawful carnal knowledge of his 15-year-old biological daughter (name withheld). DAILY POST learnt that the Baale was arrested following a report by the daughter at Owode Egbado police station. The Ogun State Police Image Maker, Abimbola Oyeyemi, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST on Thursday. According to Oyeyemi, the daughter had reported that her father had been having sex with her since when she was eleven years old. The ugly incident has affected the daughter as she now finds it difficult to control her urinary system, it was said. The victim reportedly told the police that she lost her mother when she was barely two years old, adding that the suspect did not allow her to know any relation of her late mother and she was left with no option, other than to continue staying with her father, who eventually used that opportunity to sexually abuse her from time to time. “Upon the report, the DPO Owode-Egbado, SP Olabisi Elebute, quickly led her men to the place where the Baale was promptly arrested. “On interrogation, he first denied the allegation, but when he was confronted by the victim and one of his ex-wives, who corroborated the victim’s statement, the suspect fainted and was taken to the hospital for resuscitation,” Oyeyemi disclosed. He added that the ex-wife had informed the police that she caught the village head red-handed while having sex with his daughter, saying that was the reason she left him. He informed that the victim has been taken to Stella Obasanjo Motherless Babies Home in Abeokuta for safety. Meanwhile, the Commissioner of Police, CP Edward A. Ajogun has ordered the transfer of the suspect to the anti-human trafficking and child labor unit of the State CIID for investigation and prosecution.

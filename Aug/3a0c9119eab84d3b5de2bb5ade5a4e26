A total of thirty Nigerian girls stranded in Lebanon have begged the Nigerian government to release them. They made the appeal in a statement by the President of Journalists International Forum for Migration (JIFORM), Mr Ajibola Abayomi, made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Saturday.
Abayomi told NAN that the message was being relayed following their encounter with the victims. He disclosed that the ladies are all camped in one room with faulty toilet and other utilities in a building at Dawra city in Lebanon. One of the victims, Miss Adebisi Comfort-Oluwatoyin with Passport No. number A10597908, had informed JIFORM that they had to escape from the inhuman treatment by their mistresses and hosts. The victim is said to be a 23-year-old lady from Ondo State, who was a resident in Osun State before departing Nigeria in December 2019. “Help us appeal to the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) and others to save us,” she begged. She added that the Nigerian embassy in Lebanon had tried to secure their return but their belongings and international passports were seized. “Our employers cut our hairs with razor blade and the police and their immigration are always on their side. We are not getting justice and our lives are in danger,” Abayomi quoted the victim as saying. Recall that NIDCOM had recently secured the return of Peace Busari and other girls back to Nigeria. Peace and 21 other Nigerians stranded in Lebanon were evacuated to Abuja by the federal government. Peace Ufoma, who was trafficked to Lebanon was rescued after she was put up for sale on a social media platform by Wael Jerro, a Lebanese man.

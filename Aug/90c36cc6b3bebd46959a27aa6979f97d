A former Governor of Ogun State, Gbenga Daniel, has said ex-Senator Buruji Kashamu’s last wish, was to make peace with everybody, including those he disagreed with politically. Daniel stated this on Tuesday, when he paid a condolence visit to the deceased’s family at Ijebu-Igbo. Kashamu, who was the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the 2019 elections in the state, died from COVID-19 on Saturday. He was later buried on Sunday at his residence. In a statement signed by his media aide, Steve Oliyide, Daniel revealed that Kashamu sent a delegation on Wednesday, three days before his death. “Buruji sent a delegation to me last Wednesday, August 4, 2020, who came to discuss with me about his wish that I should provide further leadership for the political structure which he built and has nurtured over the years. “When the representatives, which included his lawyer came, I discouraged political discussion and pleaded with them to all go and pray for his survival. Unfortunately, he passed on a few days after. “We’re mourning a great man. His wish was to make peace with everyone before his death. As a human, you must have strong friends and strong enemies.”

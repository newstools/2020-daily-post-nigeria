Paris Saint-Germain manager, Thomas Tuchel, laughed when asked about signing Lionel Messi, following their Champions League final defeat. The French club’s former academy graduate, Kingsley Coman, netted the winner as Bayern Munich beat PSG 1-0 on Sunday. In an interview on BT Sport after the game in Lisbon, Tuchel was asked about Messi, who is said to be unhappy in Barcelona. In response, the German tactician said: “Which coach says no to Messi? “We decided not to talk about transfers – not one transfer in this period. We will sit together in the next days. We have many things to do to improve the squad. “I think Messi finishes his career in Barcelona. He is Barcelona.”

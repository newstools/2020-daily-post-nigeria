Prof. Kingsley Moghalu, the 2019 Presidential candidate of the Young Progressives Party, YPP, has warned that the military coup in Mali and the resignation of President of Mali, Ibrahim Keita could destabilize West Africa. DAILY POST reports that the military coup on Tuesday led to the resignation of President Ibrahim Keita. Malian soldiers had explained why Keita was booted out and also revealed their next line of action. Reacting, Moghalu on his Twitter page said the military coup is a sober reminder that democracy is not permanent in Africa. According to him, the years of corruption and rigging of elections triggered the coup in Mali. His tweet read: “The military coup in Mali is a sobering reminder that democracy is not yet necessarily permanent in Africa. It could destabilize West Africa. “It was triggered by years of turmoil from govt corruption, alleged rigging of elections & instability from a rise of Islamist insurgency.” Meanwhile, the Nigerian government has condemned the coup. Minister of Foreign affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama on Wednesday called for an immediate and unconditional restoration of constitutional order.

Big Brother Naija housemate, Kidwayya, has claimed he does not have feelings for Erica. Kiddwaya said this during the post-eviction interview with the host of the reality show, Ebuka Obi-Uchendu. When asked about the love triangle between him, Erica and Laycon, he replied: “I don’t have feelings for her. “I like her smile. I like everything about her and I am enjoying my time with her.” DAILY POST reports that before Sunday’s eviction, Big Brother vowed to punish Kiddwaya for having a conversation with Erica. Biggie noted that “this will be dealt with tomorrow”. The two housemates who were evicted today are Eric and Tochi.

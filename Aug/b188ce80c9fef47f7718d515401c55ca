Controversial radio personality and self-acclaimed Bible scholar, Daddy Freeze, has reacted to the love triangle between Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemates, Laycon, Kiddwaya and Erica. Laycon has been emotionally down and finds it difficult to move on after his love interest was turned down by Erica. Recall that Erica said she is just friends with Laycon and is physically attracted to male housemate, Kiddwaya, who she described as her ‘Bestie’ during Sunday live eviction. However, despite insisting he would keep distance from her, Laycon has been seen talking to Erica about his feelings. Reacting, Freeze on his Twitter handle on Tuesday morning, advised Laycon to come out from the house and see better girls in the real world to marry. “Laycon should come out and see better girls in the real world to marry,” Freeze tweeted. Meanwhile, Big Brother on Sunday apologized for interfering in the love episode by the three housemates. DAILY POST recalls that Erica before making her decision on her deputy head of house, met Laycon and told him she trusts him and feels safer with him. However, Laycon, who has been finding it hard to move on from Erica, on Monday night got really upset after she chose Kiddwaya, as deputy HOH despite speaking with him earlier.

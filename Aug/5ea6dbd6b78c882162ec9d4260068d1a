Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemates, Nengi have been issued a final warning for shoving fellow housemate, Kaisha during an argument. They were issued the warning for flouting the rule in article 18 for physical violence following their fight. Biggie addressing the housemates warned Nengi and Kaisha, adding that another act of disobedience will result in a strike for both housemates. He further told Lucy, Erica and the other housemates to resolve their differences and obey the rules in the house. Recall that Nengi during an argument over boiling water on Saturday shoved Kaisha after they had a war of words and nearly went physical. The argument started when Kaisha said she saw water plugged in but wasnâ€™t boiling and decided to fix it properly, however, Nengi who thought she disconnected it snapped at her. This led to both housemates hurling insults at each other.

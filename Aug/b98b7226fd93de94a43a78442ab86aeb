Arsenal is looking to secure the future of three players this week before the new season starts. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has agreed to a new three-year £250,000-a-week deal in principle. The Gunners are hoping to announce it in the coming days, in what would be a big boost for Mikel Arteta. The club will also turn down interest from Wolverhampton Wanderers in Ainsley Maitland-Niles. Maitland-Niles has three years left on his current contract but could be in line for an extension. Arsenal is also desperate to keep Emiliano Martinez and will also hand the Argentine goalkeeper fresh terms after Arteta picked him ahead of Bernd Leno for the Community Shield. The Gunners are also close to completing a £27m deal for Lille defender Gabriel.

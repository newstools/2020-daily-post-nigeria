Senator Shehu Sani has reacted to the kidnapping of Junior Secondary School (JSS3) students by gunmen suspected to be Fulani herdsmen. The gunmen invaded Damba-Kasaya village, Chikun LGA of Kaduna State on Monday. DAILY POST had reported that the gunmen, who killed one person and abducted many of the villagers, stormed popular Prince Academy in the village to abduct Junior Secondary School (JSS3) students receiving lessons preparatory to their final exams. Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th Assembly said that the incident again attested to the level of security paralysis in the State. Reacting, Sani wrote on his official Twitter handle on Monday night: “The Kidnapping of the JSS 3 students in Damba-Kasaya in Kunai ward, Chikun LGA Kaduna State by terrorists is condemnable. “This again attests to the level of security paralysis in the State. “Kaduna, like other states in a similar situation, needs prayers and help in equal measure.”

Dino Melaye, former Kogi West Senator, has reacted to the Supreme Court ruling which affirmed the election of the State Governor, Yahaya Bello. Recall that the apex court dismissed the appeal by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governorship candidate in the last election, Musa Wada challenging the election of Bello. Wada, in his appeal, had claimed that the November 16, 2019 governorship election in the state, was riddled with serious electoral infractions; rigging and over-voting The former PDP governorship candidate also claimed that Bello did not secure the highest votes as required by law. However, the Supreme Court had dismissed Wada’s appeal over his inability to prove allegations of electoral malpractices in the November 16 governorship election. Reacting, Melaye said the All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state believes in using “guns” to achieve electoral victory, unlike the PDP that believes in God. “Kogi PDP is saying To God be the Glory..Kogi APC is saying to Gun be the glory. God will do a new thing in His own time. SDM,” Melaye tweeted.

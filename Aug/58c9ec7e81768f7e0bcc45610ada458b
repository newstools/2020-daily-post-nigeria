Big Brother Naija 2020 ‘Lockdown’ housemate, Kiddwaya, has advised his housemate and lover, Erica to look beyond just physical attraction when she is considering settling down with a man. Kiddwaya, who is this week’s Head of House, said this after Erica approached him with her situation with male housemate, Laycon. DAILY POST recalls that both Erica and Laycon have been entangled in a love controversy since the start of the reality show. Erica had said that she is just friends with Laycon and physically attracted to Kiddwaya, who she described as her ‘Bestie’. Kiddwaya to Erica: “Those who are attracted to a Man’s physically and go into a relationship with them for such reason; those sort of relationship does not last. In her response, Erica said: “Like You [Kiddwaya]” Speaking further, Kiddwaya told Erica how he broke up with his ex, as he said: “She was too good, and I was not ready. She wanted us to get married, and I was just 21 then and immature. I thought it wise to return to Nigeria while I left her back in the UK to be happy. I ended everything for her to be happy.”

BNYL Chief Press Secretary, Dianabasi Odung, gave the warning while speaking in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, and was contained in a statement he forwarded to DAILY POST. The group said it will effectively use its grassroots structures to checkmate the activities of the herdsmen and the security group in the Southeast and Southsouth. Odung said BNYL will tackle any suspicious activity, which may be bloody. He said the Fulani security group if seen anywhere in the region will be attacked. “We dare them to be more visible, we want to see them, if they’re man enough let them be visible like normal security group and face confrontations from us. “But if they chose to operate like terrorists that they have always been known for, then we shall meet in the bushes. Their actions will only risk the lives of the cattle breeders” the BNYL warned.

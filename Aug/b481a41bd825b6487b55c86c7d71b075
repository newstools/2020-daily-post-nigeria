Nollywood actor, Blossom Chukwujekwu’s ex-wife, Maureen Esisi, has shared how she found out that her marriage had failed. Maureen took to her Instagram page to reveal how her father broke the news of her crashed marriage to her. According to her, she was the last person to know her marriage had crashed and wondered how they got to that state. She, however, added that she was not the perfect partner but was the actor’s best. Her post on Instagram read: “Worst day today, work sucked greatly, my heart sank too. “Weird thing is by this time last year, exactly same date and same time, my old man broke to me the news of my marriage being over. “I laughed for a long time, standing up from where I sat listening to him as he tried to find the best words to convey the message to me and I placed both hands in my pocket and paced the room silently as he looked at me waiting on me to say something. “I pondered in my head about what I had just heard, why I was the last person to know it and how in the world we got there.” Maureen further lamented about how African culture makes it difficult for a woman to move on and take it all in after a bad marriage. “African culture makes it so that the woman must take it all in, she must understand no matter what, must subdue, never complain, learn to live with whatever, forgive even when she can’t, show happiness even when she is depressed, she must show strength even when she is weak but the man, He is allowed to NOT take shit (even the tiniest of it) He would even be praised for it. Life! She, however, failed to give the real reason her marriage to Blossom crashed. “September 11th in View; I will be 33, Someday, I will tell this story. I am happier, at oeace, stronger, richer, single and free. “I was not perfect, I will never be but I was his best!” she said.

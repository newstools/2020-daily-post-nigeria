Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has reacted to the retirement of Real Madrid legend, Iker Casillas, from football. DAILY POST recalls that Casillas announced his retirement from football in a post via his Twitter handle on Tuesday. Casilla said: “The most important thing in life is the path you travel and the people who accompany you, not the destination to which it takes you. “Because with work and effort, I think I can say, without hesitation, that it has been the path and the dream destination.” Reacting to the development, Messi, who played against Casilla during the goalkeeper’s time at the Los Blancos, said the Spaniard passed into the history of football a long time ago. The Argentine captain, however, described Casilla as a ‘spectacular goalkeeper’. “Iker retires today, but he passed into the history of football a long time ago,” Messi told AS. “Not only because he was a benchmark in La Liga, but also because he managed to win everything internationally. “You’re a spectacular goalkeeper, and it was really hard to have you as an opponent. “But, looking back, I also think that it was a pretty nice rivalry that made us have to outdo ourselves every time we faced each other.”

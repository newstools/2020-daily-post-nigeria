Abubakar Malami, the Attorney-General of the Federation, AGF, and Minister of Justice, has described as false reports that he conspired with a lawyer to testify against Ibrahim Magu, the suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC. Malami made the denial in a statement signed by his spokesman, Umar Gwandu and made available to reporters on Monday. The statement said that report about the Malami’s involvement with one Donald Wokoma was false. The statement reads: “The attention of the office of the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice has been drawn to a flimsy allegation made by one, Victor Giwa, Esq accusing the Honourable Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN of conniving with one Donald Wokoma to witch-hunt him over what he termed as ‘his refusal to testify against Ibrahim Magu’ at the ongoing Retired Justice Ayo Salami-led Presidential Panel probing the suspended Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC), Ibrahim Magu. It added that the AGF never met Giwa nor had any discussions with Wokoma nor asked anybody, personally or by proxy, to engage the so-called Victor to testify against the suspended EFCC boss. The statement said the Minister did not set up the investigation panel to probe Magu and not saddled with any responsibility to procure witness(es) for the panel. According to the statement, Malami is never a member of the panel constituted by President Muhammadu Buhari nor does it fall within his realm of authority to invite witness (es) for a presidential probe panel.

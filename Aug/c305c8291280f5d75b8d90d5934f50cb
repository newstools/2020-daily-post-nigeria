The Bauchi State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday disclosed that it has decided to refund the fees paid for the purchase of nomination forms by members who contested for chairmanship and councillorship slots in its primary elections ahead of the local government elections in the state but lost out. The partyâ€™s state Publicity Secretary, Yayanuwa Zainabari, revealed this while addressing journalists at the party secretariat in Bauchi. The decision, according to Zainabari, was to a demonstration of fairness, submitting that it is only fair to refund the fees paid to assuage the lost at the primaries. He added that the move is also aimed at demonstrating that the party is a united entity and members are working as a family to ensure victory at the polls. The PDP spokesman declared that the ruling party in the state has done its homework very well with a view to emerging victorious in the forthcoming local government elections in the state. He informed that the party is fielding 20 chairmanship candidates and a total of 300 are councillorship candidates in the local government elections coming up 17th October, 2020. Zainabari assured that the PDP-led administration in the state will provide a level playing field for every candidate, adding that the elections will be conducted in a free and fair atmosphere. He stated that the elections are long overdue in the state as they were last held 12 years ago, adding that this explains why people of the state are eagerly awaiting the elections day.

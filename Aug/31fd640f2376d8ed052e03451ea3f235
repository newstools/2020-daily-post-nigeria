The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to adjust its timetable for Edo and Ondo governorship elections. It cited the Court of Appeal’s judgment that upturned the deregistration of 23 political parties. NAN reports that CUPP made the demand in a statement by its media committee chairman, Chukwudi Ezeobika. The body insisted that rescheduling had become necessary. Ezeobika warned against disenfranchising parties that did not conduct primaries prior to the court judgment. “The coalition demands immediate adjustment on the time and date of the affected governorship elections to avoid waste of taxpayers money. It is also to avoid the court order bringing the whole exercise to nullity.” The electoral body had disclosed that it would approach the Supreme Court over the Court of Appeal judgment.

Manchester City are confident Lionel Messi would snub other clubs to sign for them, if Barcelona eventually decide to negotiate his sale, ESPN reports. Paris Saint-Germain are also keen on signing Messi, after Neymar reportedly spoke with him over the phone on Thursday about the possibility of a move to Ligue 1. Despite that, City feel the Etihad is the 33-year-old’s most likely destination, if he manages to force a transfer. It is believed Messi has requested a meeting with the Barca board to facilitate his exit. City are hopeful the LaLiga club will eventually cede and agree to let Messi go for a reasonable price, given his desire to leave. Although nothing is agreed, City are in regular touch with Messi’s father, Jorge. The player will be offered a three-year deal with City, with the option to then move to partner club New York City FC for another two years at the end of his career.

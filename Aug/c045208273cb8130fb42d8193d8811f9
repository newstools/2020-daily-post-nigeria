Big Brother on Monday asked housemate, Dorathy, out of the diary room for indecent dressing. Dorathy was given 30 seconds by the Big Brother to change her outfit. The Busty lady wore a red tank top and an unbuttoned jacket that revealed her bustline but quickly changed into a black shirt. Biggie said: “Dorathy you have 30 seconds to change your outfit and return to the diary room.” Meanwhile, Dorathy, later kicked against the new voting process during her diary session with Biggie. When asked if the voting process was the best, Dorathy said No, adding that the process is not wise. Dorathy said: “The new voting process is not wise because housemates would regret it. “It is not about friendship. The game is not about who has your back but war.” Recall that the BBNaija viewers have also lamented the new voting style which leaves the fate of housemates on votes of fellow players of the game.

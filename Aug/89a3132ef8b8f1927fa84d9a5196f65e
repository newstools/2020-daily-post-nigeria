The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said Senator Barnabas Gemade and the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Yakubu Dogara, returned to the party, because of the successful reconciliation efforts of the APC Caretaker Committee-led by Yobe state Governor, Mai Mala Buni. APC Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena, said this in a statement in Abuja on Sunday. “The return of Senator Barnabas Gemade to the APC is another signpost of the well-received and successful reconciliation efforts being led by Governor Mai Mala Buni as Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extra-Ordinary National Convention Planning Committee. “Sen. Gemade, who was a former National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), swells the numbers of recent APC returnees which includes the former Speaker, House of Representatives, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara.” Both Dogara and Gemade returned from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

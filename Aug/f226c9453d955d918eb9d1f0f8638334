Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, lockdown housemate, Kiddwaya on Saturday night told Erica that he was only teaching Nengi how to flirt. Kiddwaya said this after Erica flared up and confronted him after she saw him associating with Nengi in the kitchen. Recall that Erica and Kiddwaya had broken up and made up a night ago. Kiddwaya had confronted Nengi in the kitchen where he held a conversation with her shortly after they left the party room last night. From the video, Kiddwaya could be seen touching and smiling with Nengi while Erica watched him in pain. However, Erica reacted to his behaviour which she finds unacceptable, but unfortunately, Kiddwaya finds nothing wrong with it. “I was only teaching Nengi how to flirt,” Kiddwaya told Erica. Watch the video below: ERICA: My business is with you and you have no right to insult me by behaving like that. KIDD: you’re always in your feelings. ERICA: You Don’t see anything wrong in what you did right?KIDD: No, and you’re exaggerating. I was only teaching NENGI how to flirt (4of5) #BBNaija pic.twitter.com/nCOp7chpoP — DRACONIS (@la_ghivver) August 30, 2020

Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has admitted his team must stop conceding soft goals, if they are serious about winning the Champions League. The former Premier League champions host Real Madrid in the Champions League last-16 second leg on Friday night. Guardiola’s men go into the home leg of the tie with a 2-1 advantage. However, the Spaniard is wary about their shakiness in defence. In the quarter-finals against Tottenham last season, two goals conceded in three minutes early on in the second leg at home ultimately saw City crash out It was a similar story the previous season away to Liverpool at the same stage, where three goals shipped in 19 minutes killed off any hopes City had in the return leg. “Yeah definitely. More than just conceding the goals, the way we concede the goals. “If they [opponents] are brilliant and make a good action, we have to accept it. But most of them it was goals we could have avoided. “So we have to avoid it, making mistakes like that, because this competition punishes you a lot. “If we want to take a step forward as a team, to be close to win this competition, we have to be better in this area,” Guardiola told a press conference on Thursday.

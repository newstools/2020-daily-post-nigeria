The monarch made the call while interacting with youths in his palace as part of the celebration of International Youth Day, on Wednesday. He said a new reality television that would be beneficial to youths should be put together to replace BBNaija. According to Ooni of Ife: “Nigerian youths are fond of accusing and abusing our leaders. Stop abusing them. Contribute your own quota. “Let’s wear our thinking caps and begin to act like the real future leaders that we are. “In the last general election, the total number of votes cast was around 27 million while over 170 million people voted during the 2019 Big Brother Naija reality show. It misrepresents the goodness and integrity of the Nigerian youths”.

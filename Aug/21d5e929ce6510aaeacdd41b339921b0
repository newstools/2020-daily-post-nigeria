Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has singled out Gabriel Jesus as the best player over the two legs against Real Madrid. City are through to the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League, following a 2-1 win over Madrid on Friday night. Jesus set up the opener for Raheem Sterling in the first half, before pouncing on a Raphael Varane error to score the winner in the second half. “First half our wingers were more inside than outside and it was not good. Second half they played wider and it was better. It was a wrong decision I had done. “This competition punishes you, we know that from our own experiences. “Jesus was the man of the two games for us, he set up the first and scored the second,” Guardiola told BT Sport after the game. City will face Lyon, who eliminated Juventus, for a place in the semi-final.

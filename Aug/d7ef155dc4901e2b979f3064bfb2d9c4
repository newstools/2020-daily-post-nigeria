A six-year-old girl and a woman were said to have died in a fatal road accident along Lagos-Sagamu highway. Six other passengers reportedly sustained various degrees of injuries. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps Spokesman, Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST. According to Akinbiyi, the road crash occurred around 2:05 pm on Tuesday at Youth camp, inbound Lagos. It involved a Mazda bus with registration number, FUF 109 ZD. It was gathered that the bus had a burst tyre while on motion and got somersaulted. “According to eyewitness account, it was learnt the commercial bus was coming from Kwara State inbound Lagos, when it had a burst tyre due to ‘over-speeding’ with a female toddler losing her life immediately while a 6-year-old girl and a woman died later at Idera Hospital, Sagamu,” Akinbiyi said. DAILY POST learnt that the six injured victims – two men and four women, are also at Idera Hospital, Sagamu, receiving treatment. While TRACE Corps commiserates with the family of the deceased, the traffic agency appealed to motorists to desist from over-inflating and under-inflating their tyres. He warned against excessive speed, especially at diversion and construction zones because of its attendant consequences.

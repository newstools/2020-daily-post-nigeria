One Ugochukwu Obiakor has been sentenced to 25 years imprisonment for defiling an 11-year-old girl in Ogun State. The 36-year-old Obiakor was sentenced by an Ogun State High Court on Wednesday. He had earlier pleaded not guilty to the one-count charge brought against him. But the court said he was found guilty of the charge and convicted him for forcefully having sexual intercourse with the 11-year-old girl. In her judgment, the Ogun Chief Judge, Justice Mosunmola Dipeolu, said evidence presented before the court by the prosecution was tenable, saying she found the convict guilty as charged. As a result, Dipeolu sentenced the convict to 25 years jail term with hard labour. DAILY POST reports that the prosecution counsel and Director of Legal Drafting in Ogun, James Mafe, had earlier informed the court that the convict committed the crime on September 4, 2017 at Omu-Aleku Village in Mowe area of Ogun state. According to Mafe, the convict forcefully had unlawful sexual intercourse with the girl. He stated that medical results conducted proved that the victim’s hymen was broken in the process. Obiakor was said to have dragged his victim from her mother’s shop into an uncompleted building, where he had carnal knowledge of her. Mafe said the offence contravened Section 32 of the Child Rights Law of Ogun, 2006.

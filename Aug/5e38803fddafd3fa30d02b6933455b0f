Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, Prince, has revealed that he turned down fellow housemate, Erica when she made advances at him. Erica is currently having issues with her so-called lover, Kiddwaya. But both Prince and Trickytee seem to have absolved Kiddwaya of any wrong doing. Prince said that Erica had once come to him telling him that she loves him but he simply rejected her proposal. According to him, “I know there was a time Erica was in my room crying and was like…she loves me and I told her I like you too but….I like you too but I’m sorry. You go dey cry every day (if I date you) just like what is happening now.” DAILY POST reported that Erica and Kiddwaya broke up after the former claimed that the latter has no respect nor regard for her. Kiddwaya had said he felt that he upsets Erica more than he makes her happy and for this reason decided to quit the relationship.

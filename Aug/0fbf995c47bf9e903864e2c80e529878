Arsenal are stepping up their search for potential goalkeeper signings, while they seek a second opinion on Bernd Leno’s injury, the UK Sun reports. Leno missed much of the Premier League restart, after sustaining a ligament strain following a collision with Brighton striker, Neal Maupay, during the Gunners’ defeat 2-1 in June. Emiliano Martinez has impressed in his absence, as Arsenal finished eighth and clinched their 14th FA Cup. While Martinez is set to be rewarded with a new deal, there is uncertainty over Leno’s immediate future. The club wants further tests on the Leno’s injury and are seeking clarification on how long he will be out for. Martinez looks set to start the season as the first-choice keeper, but Mikel Arteta may need cover in case Leno faces a long spell on the sidelines. —

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija lovers, Neo and Vee have raised suspicions of having sex in the Lockdown house. It all started on Wednesday night after Vee complained that she has not seen her period for the month. Again, on Thursday, Neo asked if she has seen her period, adding that she looks pregnant. Vee said: “I’ve missed my period, I’m gonna fu*k you up. You should be scared.” Neo responding said: “I’m a fu*king 26yr old man, I’m Neo, I’m a reality Tv star. I got you. “You probably just miscalculated so don’t be scared.” This conversation has stirred suspicions from BBNaija fans who are speculating that the housemates had sex where there were no cameras. Here are some comments gathered by DAILY POST from Twitter: @MsJojacobs “Does it mean Neo and Vee made love.

No specific date has been fixed for resumption of academic activities for students at the University of Ilorin. This is according to the Vice-Chancellor of the institution, Professor Sulyman Age Abdulkareem. Speaking with newsmen in Ilorin on Monday, the Vice-Chancellor said this became pertinent since the Federal government was yet to give a specific date for institutions to open their gates to their students. “UNILORIN would remain closed to students pending the directives of constituted authorities. “The university is fully prepared to welcome its students back to campus for the completion of the rest of the 2019/2020 academic session and subsequent new session,” he stated. Professor Abdulkareem disclosed that every arrangement was being perfected “to ensure that the campus is made safe and conducive for members of the university community.” He said arrangements were also ongoing to ensure that the processes of admission of new students begin as stated by concerned authorities. The VC expressed delight that the institution remains the choice of the greatest number of intending students. He described UNILORIN “as a training ground, not only in the academic field but also in leadership,” adding that he was not surprised about the appointment of some members of staff serving as Vice Chancellors of some sister universities among positions. Students of the institution have been out of campus since the outbreak of the Coronavirus pandemic in accordance with the Federal government directive to mitigate the community spread of the virus.

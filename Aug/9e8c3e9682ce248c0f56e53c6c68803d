Our academic activities and life have contained seamlessly since the beginning of this academic year. We had started the second semester before the global pause caused by the Covid-19 pandemic began. We knew that the pandemic was not childâ€™s play and told our staff and students that the world would never be the same again. Without any loss of time, we moved all our activities online. It was easy because in the last two years we have continued to insist that all lectures must be uploaded on our university platform for students to download and read. Most of the lectures had already been added online before the lockdown began. The university senate approved that all lectures must be held online via Zoom, Google Meet or GO University online learning platform. To underscore our commitment to online teaching, we also organized the first international Zoom conference on e-learning in Nigeria on 10 June 2020, which attracted more than four hundred participants (as well as speakers) from different parts of the world. We have also continued to hold senate and other meetings online via Zoom. In fact, without any exaggeration or self-glorification, Godfrey Okoye University is leading today in online activities (lectures, meetings, workshops, conferences, etc.) among all the universities in Nigeria. Besides, all our institutions, including our nursery and primary schools, are holding online classes and meetings uninterruptedly. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-827971 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image1-3.jpg" alt="" width="927" height="256" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image1-3.jpg 927w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image1-3-300x83.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px"> INFORMATION REGARDING THE 2020/21 ACADEMIC SESSION The university has confirmed that the 2020/21 academic session will start on 5 October, 2020.

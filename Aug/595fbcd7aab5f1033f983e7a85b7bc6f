The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has insisted that it didn’t substitute the candidates of the African Action Congress (AAC) or any other political party for the October 10 governorship election in Ondo State. INEC, in a statement by Festus Okoye, the National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, on Monday, said it received only one submission from the AAC through its dedicated online portal for candidate nomination. The commission said that the names uploaded on the portal by the political parties were the same names published. “On Friday, July 31 2020, INEC published the Provisional List of Candidates for the Ondo State Governorship Election scheduled for October 10, 2020, in its State Office in Akure and also uploaded the same on its website and social media platforms. “The list contains the names of the Governorship and Deputy Governorship candidates submitted by 17 political parties, including the African Action Congress (AAC) at the close of nomination on July 28 2020. “However, one of the aspirants in the primaries of the party accused the Commission of substituting his name as the rightful Governorship candidate of the party, while another aspirant also claimed that the Commission substituted his Deputy Governorship candidate. “Contrary to these assertions, INEC didn’t substitute the name of any aspirant or candidate. The Commission received only one submission from the AAC through its dedicated online portal for candidate nomination. “There was no human interface,” the statement read in part. DAILY POST had reported that ACC had threatened to take legal action against the INEC for substituting the name of its Ondo deputy governorship candidate with an unknown one. INEC had on Friday released the list of candidates of the 17 political parties that would participate in the October 10 governorship election in the state.

The Federal Government has directed civil servants on Grade Levels 12 and 13, as well as those on important duties to resume full work. The Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folashade Yemi-Esan, gave the directive in a circular on Monday in Abuja, NAN reports. Presently, only workers on Grade Level 14 and above go to offices, and work for just 3 days a week, as part of measures to curb the spread of COVID-19. Yemi-Esan, in the circular, said, “Workers affected would resume work from Monday to Friday, and be in the office from 8 am to 4 pm as usual.” The new development shadows a directive by the Presidential Taskforce (PTF) on COVID-19, asking workers to resume full working hours and days. The PTF had, however, said that consideration must be given to the health implication of the number to recall for duties, in the light of the extant guidelines on the measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Yemi-Esan urged Chief Executive Officers to ensure full compliance with the directives on the coronavirus pandemic preventive measures, including physical distancing, regular washing or sanitising of hands and wearing of face masks. She also said that efforts should be made to avoid overcrowding in individual offices. According to her, where the number of staff resuming work was large, Permanent Secretaries and Chief Executive Officers should consider the option of duty rosters.

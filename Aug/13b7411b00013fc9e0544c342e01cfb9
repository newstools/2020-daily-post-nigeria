Paris Saint-Germain forwards, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe, have reacted to their team’s Champions League final 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich on Sunday night. PSG missed chances in both halves, as their former youth graduate Kingsley Coman who left the French Ligue 1 champions in 2014, headed the winner just before the hour mark in Portugal. Reacting, Neymar and Mbappe took to their Twitter handles to congratulate Bayern Munich after they defeated Thomas Tuchel’s side. “Losing is part of the sport, we try everything, we fight until the end,” Neymar posted on Twitter. “Thanks for the support and affection of everyone. Congratulations, Bayern.” On his part, Mbappe wrote: “Disappointed not to end this year with the best of awards, but life is made that way. “We fought with all our might. Congratulations to Bayern. And a big thank you for your support.”

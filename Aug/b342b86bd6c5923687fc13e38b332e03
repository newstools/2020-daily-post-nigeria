The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has commenced the investigation of two Lebanese, Dina Jihad Khali and Chamseddine Waell Mohammed. They were arrested on Wednesday by officers of the Customs Area Command, Port Harcourt, Rivers State. Khali and Mohammed were attempting to smuggle a total sum of $890,000 out of Nigeria through the Port Harcourt International Airport. The suspects have been handed over to the Zonal office of the EFCC. Mohammed Olayinka, Customs Area Controller, disclosed that Khali with Passport Number LR152975 (Republic of Lebanon) was arrested with $670,000. Mohammed with Passport Number LR0356598 (Republic of Lebanon) had $220,000. They were both arrested while trying to board a flight to Lebanon. Olayinka said the suspects failed to declare to Customs. The money has been lodged at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in Rivers State for safekeeping. Principal Detective Superintendent Macaulay Olayinka, who received the suspects, thanked the Customs for their vigilance and the synergy with the EFCC. The suspects will be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-828005 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EFCC-AND-CUSTOMS-OFFICIALS2-1-1024x797.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="576" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EFCC-AND-CUSTOMS-OFFICIALS2-1-1024x797.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EFCC-AND-CUSTOMS-OFFICIALS2-1-300x233.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EFCC-AND-CUSTOMS-OFFICIALS2-1-1536x1195.jpg 1536w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/EFCC-AND-CUSTOMS-OFFICIALS2-1-2048x1593.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px">

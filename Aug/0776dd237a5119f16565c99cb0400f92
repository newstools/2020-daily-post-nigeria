The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has vowed to retaliate for recent killings in the Aziko community of Bayelsa State. Suspected herdsmen killed a pregnant woman, her husband and others. In a statement on Tuesday, IPOB spokesman, Emma Powerful, threatened that the group would retaliate. Powerful said what is happening in Southern Kaduna “where herdsmen, Boko Haram, bandits and other groups are slaughtering innocent Christians without any hoot by the government is an indication that Nigeria is already a failed state.” The official declared that IPOB, “is ready to repel them from Biafra land no matter the cost.” He condemned the, “atrocity and the persistent killings in Biafra land. We assure the perpetrators of this heinous crime and their sponsors that they will regret their actions very soon.” Powerful wondered why the world “is still keeping quiet over the ongoing genocide in Biafra land.” He noted that, “herdsmen footsoldiers and their sponsors behind this evil will never go unpunished.” IPOB said they would not allow “blood suckers to go free with these barbaric killings. We won’t allow these vampires to replicate their atrocities in Southern Kaduna in any part of Biafraland.” The statement warned that, “no part of Biafra or even the country will be a safe haven for them anytime we start paying them back in their own coin.” IPOB stressed that the present generation of Biafrans was not the same as those of 1967 and 1970. It urged Biafrans to be prepared, “because the right time for revenge is fast approaching, their continued mayhem must be resisted.”

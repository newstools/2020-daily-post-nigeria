The Nigerian government on Monday said the Case Fatality Rate, CFR, amid the COVID-19 outbreak is on the decline in the country. Boss Mustapha, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, SGF, said the number of CFR in the last five months has greatly reduced. Mustapha, who is the Chairman of the Presidential Task force on COVID-19, however, noted that there was need for caution. He spoke during the task force daily briefing in Abuja. According to Mustapha: “The PTF has however continued to study the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and we note that it has been on steady decline over the last few months. ”On April 30; 3 per cent, May 31; 2.8 per cent, June 30; 2.3 per cent, July 31; 2.0 per cent and Aug. 22; 1.92 per cent. “We are, however, convinced that our sample collection is still low. We, therefore, encourage states to ramp up their testing and to declare correct results because early detection will ultimately translate to treatment and ultimately level the curve. “With our statistics standing at 52,227 cases and 1,002 fatalities and 38,945 recoveries, Nigeria, however, maintains the 4th highest cumulative cases in Africa.”

The federal government has said it is weighing its options, over the closure of shops belonging to Nigerian traders in Ghana. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, revealed this when he met with the League of Progressive Ambassadors of Nigeria officials, led by its president, Jasper Emenike, on Monday Emenike, who briefed Onyeama on the state of affairs, called for the intervention of the government. Nigerian traders have seen their shops closed, over their failure to register with the Ghana Investment Promotion Council (GIPC). According to Onyeama, the FG will take up the matter with Ghanaian authorities and may also explore the option of approaching the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) court. “We have the intention of calling our Charge D’Affairs in Ghana for consultation and again to get to the fact. We don’t want to anticipate what our actions would be, but we will consider all the options depending on the facts. “Clearly, if it is contravening ECOWAS protocol, then we would have to look at solution including the ECOWAS Court as the final arbiter,” Onyeama said.

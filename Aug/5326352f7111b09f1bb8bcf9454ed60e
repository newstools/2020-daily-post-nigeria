The Lagos State Fire and Rescue Service has again prevented a tanker spillage from causing havoc at Anthony Bus Stop, inward Oworonshoki, Gbagada, area of the State. Speaking at the scene of the incident, the Acting Head of the Lagos State Fire Service, Mrs. Magaret Adeseye, said that the officials of the agency had swiftly responded to a distress call received at about 0455hrs on Saturday. She explained that the Tanker, a truck with a capacity of 45,000 litres and fully laden with Petroleum Motor Spirit, PMS, skidded off the road and spilled contents along the Expressway. “The truck, with registration no. APP 50 XF, was conveying PMS belonging to Akikavic Nigeria Limited and heading to service a filling station at Ibafo, Ogun State when the incident happened,” she added. She reiterated that efforts are ongoing to transfer the remaining contents to another tanker with a view to preventing a secondary incident that may cause havoc to residents of the area and other road users. While informing that firefighters from the two fire stations at Alausa and Bolade are currently putting the situation under control, Adeseye urged motorists to cooperate with the first responders and other Government officials managing the situation in order to ensure the safety of lives and property. The Acting Head of the Lagos State Fire Service, however, decried the spate of perennial accidents involving tankers on Lagos roads in recent times, advocating proper training of truck drivers to reduce such incidences in the State.

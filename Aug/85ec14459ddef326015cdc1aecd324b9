Member representing Ohaozara/Onicha/Ivo Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Hon. Livinus Makwe has stated that climate change would be Nigeria’s biggest challenge if nothing was done to curtail it. The lawmaker, who earlier sponsored a bill seeking to establish an Institute of Environmental Practitioners of Nigeria, explained that it was borne out of critical need to respond to environmental issues which he said has dawned on Nigeria. Speaking with DAILY POST on Friday in Abuja, the lawmaker noted that there was need for a body like “the Institute of Environmental Practitioners of Nigeria”, so that the responsibility of tackling the environmental issues solely lies with them. “The idea for the bill was borne out of the critical need to respond to issues of climate change. “Nigeria must take the climate change issues serious as there are already serious scientific evidences that climate change may in fact, be the greatest challenge confronting humanity. “The bill when it eventually becomes law will help different sectors of the Nigerian society to “protect our environment, which is our most enduring resources as the bill seeks to establish an Institute charged with the responsibility of regulating and managing environmental practices in Nigeria”, he insisted. “As I speak, there is desert encroachment, oil spillage, gully and erosion challenges as well as flooding all over the places,” he added. Expressing delight that the bill has scaled third reading in the House of Representatives, the legislator added that the body would regulate the way human actions affect the environment. He expressed confidence that the Senate will pass the concurrent version of the bill for it to be transmitted to the Executive for assent.

Over 5000 spare parts traders stand being evicted from the popular Ikoku Spare Part Market at Mile 3, Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. This follows an impromptu eviction notice of three weeks issued by the owners who offered no reason for the sudden decision. Though reports say the traders have been transferred to a private entity for urban development, they have been advised to seek redress in Court. Some of the affected traders appealed to the landlords to give them more time to plan their exit since no other location has been provided for them by the Rivers State Government. Others want the state government to intervene and provide an alternative location considering the importance of the service they render to residents. But Chairman of the Mile 3 Ikoku Spare Parts Market, Anthony Alaribole in reaction to the quit notice told newsmen that, “We are yearly tenants who have been operating in Ikoku for about 30-50 years. “This notice had caused confusion among many of our members because the notice is too short. He also alleged that, “The eviction notice is a strategy to destabilize the traders because of the matter they have with the police and the state government due to their demand for justice for the late Chima Ikwunado and the Ikoku4.” Port Harcourt mechanic, Chima Ikwunado was allegedly tortured to death by police officers attached to the Eagle Crack Unit. The officers from the Eagle Crack Squad who tortured the mechanic to death in December 2019 and unlawfully inflicted various degrees of injuries on Ifeanyi Onyekwere, Ogbonna Victor, Ifeanyi Osuji and Osaze Friday have been dismissed by the Rivers State Police Command and are currently facing charges of conspiracy and murder, among others. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-827451 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1597137653984-1.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="419" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1597137653984-1.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1597137653984-1-300x175.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

The Federal Government has appealed to the international community, not to be discouraged by unsubstantiated arguments, to deny the country weapons to fight insecurity. Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed stated this while speaking at the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) Forum in Abuja on Thursday. “To fight terrorists, we need platforms and weapons. “When the international community is weighed by unsubstantiated arguments to deny the country of vital platforms and weapons to fight insecurity, you cannot turn round to accuse the country of not fighting terrorism,” Mohammed said. Mohammed further claimed that “certain world powers have refused to sell to us certain vital weapons. “For more than two to three years now, we have paid for certain weapons that they have not released to us and they even refused to give us spare parts.” This comes amid claims by a former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Obadiah Mailafia, that a Northern Governor is Boko Haram leader. Mailafia reiterated his stance on Wednesday, while speaking with journalists shortly after he was released by the Department of State Services (DSS).

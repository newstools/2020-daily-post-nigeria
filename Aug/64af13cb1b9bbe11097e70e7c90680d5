Juventus has set a price tag for its winger, Douglas Costa, amid interest from Manchester United. Costa has drawn interest from Man United in the past few days. Juventus is keen to sell the Brazilian international this summer. According to TuttoSport, Juventus is demanding at least £18million for Costa, who is reportedly not in Juve’s new coach Andrea Pirlo’s plans for next season. Costa has not really impressed at Juventus since the Serie A champion made his signing permanent in 2018. The 29-year-old played 47 games in all competitions during his loan spell, scoring 6 goals, but in the following two campaigns, he has managed just 25 and 29 appearances respectively. Costa, who will turn 30 in September, has struggled with injury and a lack of form, scoring just four goals over the last two seasons.

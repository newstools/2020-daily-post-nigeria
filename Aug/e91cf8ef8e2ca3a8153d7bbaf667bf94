The senior pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa says the dream of President Muhammadu Buhari to control the church through the Company and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) cannot come true. The cleric in a statement to DAILY POST on Saturday specifically urged President Buhari not to flex his muscles at the church because nobody owns it. Reacting on Saturday, Giwa wondered why President Buhari would not focus his energy on security, corruption and Nigeria’s bad economy. The pastor alleged that the President is doing everything possible to silence the church of God. The outspoken clergy, however, advised President Buhari to control the killings and other terrorist groups in the country before fighting the church. “President Buhari wants to use the CAMA law
to silence us from speaking against injustice, maladministration and killings under his administration. “It’s not possible because the Lord has declared the bill dead. Who controls his finances? “How dare President Buhari and his agents fight the church? I think he should flex his muscles at fixing Nigeria instead of flexing his muscles at the church. “Nobody owns the church, I believe his vice president who is a Christian should educate him. If you are fighting the church, you are fighting God, and no one can fight God.”

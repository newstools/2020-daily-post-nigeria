Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki, on Thursday declared that the governorship election would end godfatherism in the state. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate spoke during his ward campaign tour across the 10 wards in Esan North East Local Government Area. He described Edo Central District as a PDP enclave, NAN reports. Obaseki charged members and supporters not to succumb to threats and intimidation. The governor stated that Nigeria does not belong to a few people. Dan Orbih, state campaign council chair, told party loyalists to keep vigil on voting day. Orbih assured the people that PDP would do everything possible to ensure that votes count. “We will not allow anybody to subvert the will of the people. In this election, we will not only vote, but defend our votes”, he said. The poll will be held on September 19. Obaseki will face his main rival, Osagie Ize-Iyamu of the All Progressives Congress (APC).

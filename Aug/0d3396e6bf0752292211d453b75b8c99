Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Neo on Wednesday night disclosed that Vee’s voice turns him on. In celebration of her 24th birthday on Wednesday, Neo made this known in front of the housemates. Vee, who is a professional singer, grew up in London and relocated to Nigeria to pursue her music career. According to Neo, he can’t wait to meet Vee’s parents and make babies with her outside the house. Neo said: “Your voice turns me on and I can’t deny that. “You are very special and I love your real ness, energy and vibe. I cannot wait to meet your parents, see you achieve your dreams and make those Yoruba babies together.” Recall that evicted BBNaija housemate, Kaisha said Vee and Neo were acting and their relationship is fake.

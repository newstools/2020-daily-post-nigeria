Manchester United defender, Chris Smalling, has returned to Old Trafford following the expiration of his loan deal at Italian side, AS Roma. He said he was ‘gutted’ that he cannot finish the season with Roma after he was left out of their away squad to tackle Sevilla in the Europa League fixture on Thursday in Spain. Smalling made the disclosure in a tweet via his official Instagram handle on Tuesday. “I am gutted that I cannot finish what we started this season,” Smalling said in a message on Instagram. “To experience the love shown to me in such a short time was extra special and it will not be forgotten. “I want to thank and wish all the players and staff the best of luck against Sevilla. DAJE ROMA!” Meanwhile, Manchester United head coach, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, had said that he would only welcome Smalling, 30, back to the club if he cannot find a centre-back to buy in the transfer market this summer ahead of next season.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-824638" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Smalling.jpg" alt="" width="931" height="399" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Smalling.jpg 931w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Smalling-300x129.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 931px) 100vw, 931px">

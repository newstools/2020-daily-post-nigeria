Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Erica, has said she can never be friends with Wathoni. Recall Erica and Wathoni had a face-off over male housemate, Kiddwaya days ago. The drama started when Erica mentioned she doesn’t like to chase guys. But, Wathoni indirectly disagreed, saying Kiddwaya who is Erica’s love interest did not chase any girl in the house. This got her angry and led to the confrontation with Wathoni. Erica during the argument made reference to Watoni’s son and asked her to act her age. Wathoni has since then remained hurt and refused to talk to Erica. On Tuesday, she told Laycon not to talk to her about Erica and wished she could be evicted from BBNaija house. However, Tolanibaj, speaking to Erica on Wednesday night, asked if she had reconciled with Wathoni. Responding, Erica said she tried to make peace but Wathoni hesitated and she has made up her mind not to be friends with her. “All the times I tried to be cool with her she’s still weird and giving negative energy. “When you know someone does not like you, it would show and always be fake. “You cannot be friends with everyone, so, abeg I’ve left her,” Erica said.

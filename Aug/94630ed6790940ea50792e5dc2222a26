The federal government has warned facilitators of Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) programme to shun corrupt tendencies. Kola Solomon, National Training Officer of the National Transfer Unit Programme, gave the warning on Tuesday in Enugu. Solomon decried reports of facilitators extorting money from beneficiaries, mostly rural dwellers. “They should not use this opportunity to start asking the beneficiaries to contribute money in any form because the programme is about lifting the poor out of poverty. “The facilitators must be transparent and not partner with corrupt minds, so that the beneficiaries will receive the actual amount, which is N10,000 every two months,’’ he said. The facilitators, selected from different local governments, are being trained on savings and group mobilization. Solomon added that the exercise will be taken to the ward level in due course. The CCT is under the Social Investment Programmes (SIP). The government recently claimed that 15.5 million Nigerians have been enrolled in the National Social Register (NSR) for benefits.

Former Arsenal midfielder, Emmanuel Petit, has said Aaron Ramsey returning to the club from Juventus, will not benefit both parties. Ramsey is available for transfer this summer, after Andrea Pirlo replaced Maurizio Sarri as manager of the Bianconeri. The Wales international only left the Emirates for the Serie A champions as a free agent last summer and currently earns £250,000-a-week in Italy. Ramsey started only 11 matches under Sarri last season, and he has already been linked with a return to Arsenal. The 29-year-old came through the ranks in North London, after signing for the club from Cardiff City in 2008. But Petit doesn’t believe a return to the Emirates would be a sensible move for either party. “Ramsey wanted to leave, what is the point in coming back? “He is on big wages at Italy and I’m pretty sure Arsenal won’t be able to give him that. That is why he left for Italy,” Petit told the UK Mirror.

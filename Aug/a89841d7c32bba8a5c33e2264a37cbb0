New Barcelona coach, Ronald Koeman, has revealed that the first thing he will say to captain, Lionel Messi, and the rest of the Blaugrana players is that ‘football is to be enjoyed.’ Koeman explained that his players must enjoy themselves if they want to get the best out of themselves. Koeman, 57, was confirmed as Barcelona manager on Wednesday morning. The Dutchman took over from Quique Setién, who was sacked on Monday after their exit from the Champions League in the hands of Bayern Munich last Friday. Speaking in his first press conference at the Auditori 1899 on Wednesday night, Koeman said, “As I am Dutch, I like to have the ball and control it. To play good football. “I have been a coach for a long time, and I have learned a lot. I am ready to coach Barça at the highest level. “Football is to be enjoyed, and that is the first thing I will say to my players. “If you don’t enjoy yourself, you won’t get the best out of yourself.”

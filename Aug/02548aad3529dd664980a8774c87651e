A Customary Court sitting at Mapo in Ibadan on Tuesday dissolved the 14-year-old marriage between one Dauda Saliman and his estranged wife, Amina over her attempt to poison him. Dauda, who resides at Ayegun area of Ibadan, approached the court to dissolve his marriage lamenting that his wife, Amina, was bent on killing him. He told the court that he had to leave his home for three years to avert his wife’s alleged plot to cut short his life. He said his wife took his name to a ‘Marabout’ who has been threatening his life because he sleeps with her, NAN reports. A marabout is a scholar of the Qur’an or religious teacher. “Times without number, Amina had tried her evil plot to kill me by poisoning my food but God had been protecting me. “This is due to no other reason than to illegitimately take over my hard-earned property. “Amina does not love me, she is only after what she can get from me. She took my name to a marabout in Ibadan who also sleeps with her. “I got this piece of evidence because that Marabout has been threatening, calling me day and night to bring an end to my life. “She is quite aware that she is not my only wife, but she wants to acquire my entire property,” Dauda complained. In her submission, the wife denied ever poisoning her husband and begged the court not to dissolve the marriage. In his ruling, President of the Court, Chief Ademola Odunade and two other arbitrators; Alhaji Suleiman Apanpa and Alhaji Rafiu Raji, dissolved the union in the interest of peace and tranquillity. He granted custody of the three children produced by the marriage to the respondent. He directed the petitioner to pay N15,000 as their monthly feeding allowance in addition to being responsible for their education and other welfare. Odunade condemned Amina’s attitude of allowing her husband live in a hotel for three years without crying out about it, describing her as “the architect of her own misfortune”.

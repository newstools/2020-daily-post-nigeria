Barely two weeks after the Imo State House of Assembly went on recess, the symbol of authority, mace is alleged to have gone missing. DAILY POST gathered that part of the news was that the Assembly mace was allegedly used for the impeachment of the Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly and his deputy about a week ago. Meanwhile, the member representing Oru-West state constituency in Imo State House of Assembly, Dominic Ezerioha, in a press briefing on Tuesday described the rumour as false and a fabrication of evil discussants who want to destroy the image of the State Assembly. Ezerioha who is the House committee chairman on Information and Judiciary said that the mace is intact and in sacred place for legislation. “The news about the missing Imo Assembly mace is completely false. It is mere propaganda orchestrated by the enemies of the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Chiji Collins to water down his efforts over the years. “As I speak, the symbol of authority is intact and in sacred place for legislature. The speaker of Imo state House of Assembly is in possession of a legal meaning of the mace belonging to the Assembly and until he ceases to be the Speaker of the House, the mace won’t be moved an inch from its sacred position. “Anybody can wake up to talk nonsense. Imagine someone telling you that your mother is a woman when you already know she is. The news is false and a figment of some peoples’ imagination. The symbol of authority, I repeat is intact and in sacred place for legislature,” he added. The mouthpiece of the House further said that the fabricators of the rumour will soon be unraveled and made to face the punishment.

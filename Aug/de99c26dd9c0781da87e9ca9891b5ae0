The Premier League has given Manchester United and Manchester City permission to start the 2020/2021 season later, following their European exploits. United reached the Europa League semi-finals, where they lost 2-1 to Sevilla on Sunday. City exited the Champions League the previous day, following a 3-1 loss to Lyon at the quarter-final stage. Both Manchester clubs have now been handed a 30-day break from the dates of their final game this season. That means they will not be required to play on September 12 and 13, the opening weekend of the new Premier League season. Instead, United and City will play their opening Premier League fixture in midweek, likely on September 15 or 16.

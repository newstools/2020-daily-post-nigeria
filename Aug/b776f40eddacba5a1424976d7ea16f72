A member of the All Progressive Congress (APC) factional group in Cross River State, Umo Adams has alleged that imposters who claimed to be protesters vandalized the Party’s property. Speaking to DAILY POST on Wednesday in one of the APC secretariats at Marian Street in Calabar, Adams said that those who protested on Tuesday were imposters as they are not councillorship candidates. “The protesters are not my colleagues, I am one of the councillors candidates that contested the elections whereas these other groups are from the other faction of the Party that is illegal and they paraded themselves as executives, so they are not part of us who passed through the CROSIEC process. He said that only 41 councillorship candidates contested the last local government election in Cross River State. “Councillorship candidates in Calabar South were five in number, I am from ward 7, Princess Asa ward 3, Ewa Bassey Ewa ward 4, Peter Ita Nya ward 10 and Ekpenyong Nsa Umo ward 9. These were the five emerging councillorship candidates who contested the election. Others who paraded themselves as candidates were not from this platform, though they aspired, they did not pass through the CROSIEC process. While the APC office at Marian Street was busy with activities as at press time, workers in the building declined to comment on the alleged protest. However, an anonymous source said “Though, the protesters came in here on Tuesday, disrupted official function and allegedly vandalised property we were not disturbed because they are not our candidates”

The Police in Warri have arrested a fourteen-year-old suspected internet fraudster also known in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State. The Divisional Police Officer “B” Division in Warri, CSP Benjamin Igometi disclosed this in a remark during a visit to members of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ Warri. CSP Igometi said the teenage boy’s father came to bail him but with a thorough investigation, it was discovered that it was the father that was aiding and abetting the boy in the criminal business. The Police boss said he would have arrested the father when he came to take the son on bail but felt there would be a public outcry over the matter. According to him, I decided to allow the father go home, while we continue with investigations. While noting that the boy was underage, CSP Igometi said, it was discovered that monies were being paid into the father’s account on behalf of the boy. “The vehicle the man uses is from the proceeds of the illicit business. You could imagine a household involved in this kind of business.” While pointing out that internet fraud has become too bad in the society, CSP Igometi said the Police must curtail its excesses in the society. “We must offend some people. I detained the boy not knowing the father is the custodian.” CSP Igometi used the medium to solicit for the cooperation of journalists who are members of the NUJ Warri for a better relationship. The Delta State Auditor of the Police Community Relations Committee, PCRC, Mr. Chris also appealed to Journalists to give the new DPO their support for him to succeed in his fight against crime and criminality. Responding, the Chairman of the Nigeria Union of Journalists, NUJ, Comrade Okies Veeky assured CSP Benjamin Igometi of the cooperation of his members to make the society better.

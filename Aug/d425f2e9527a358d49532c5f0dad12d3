The last four teams in this year’s Champions League have been confirmed, following Lyon’s 3-1 win over Manchester City on Saturday night. The Ligue 1 side shocked Pep Guardiola’s men, to book their spot in the semi-final, where they face favourites Bayern Munich. Maxwel Cornet opened scoring for Lyon, before Kevin De Bruyne equalized in the second half. With City looking to turn the screw, substitute Moussa Dembele netted a late brace to win the game. The other semi-final clash will see Paris Saint-Germain take on RB Leipzig. Both matches will be played in Lisbon next week.

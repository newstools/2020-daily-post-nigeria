Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has described the death of the leader of Afenifere socio-cultural group, Pa Ayorinde Fasanmi as a monumental loss to the country at this “crucial moment.” While describing his demise as devastating and shattering, Akeredolu said the deceased lived a fulfilled and impactful life worthy of emulation. Akeredolu stated this on Tuesday in Iye-Ekiti, Ekiti State when he led his colleagues in the SouthWest geopolitical zone as Chairman of the Governors’ Forum in the zone to bid farewell to the Second Republic senator. In the tribute titled “PA AYO FASANMI JOINS THE PANTHEON OF OUR ANCESTORS”, delivered at the burial service held at St John’s Anglican Church, Iye-Ekiti in Ekiti State, Akeredolu said in an age the indices of success have been reduced to material acquisition of filthy lucre, it was worthy of note that Senator Fasanmi stood on the side of the people with rare courage and commitment beyond mere avowals that brought about justice and fairness. Pa Fasanmi, a Second Republic Senator, passed on last week Wednesday at the age of 95. The Chairman, South West Governors’ Forum advised the current generation of politicians to be guided by exemplary conduct both as a political icon and professional pharmacist who served Nigeria and humanity in truth and character. Deputy Governors of Ekiti, Osun States, representatives of Lagos State and Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu; Secretary to the Ondo State Government, Hon Temitayo Oluwatuyi and the Chief of Staff to the Ondo State Governor, Chief Olugbenga Ale were some of the dignitaries at the service where protocols to COVID-19 were observed.

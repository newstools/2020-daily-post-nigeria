Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, is out for revenge on Sevilla when his team plays the LaLiga side in the Europa League semi-final on Sunday. Solskjaer suffered a 3-1 aggregate defeat against Sevilla, when he was manager of Molde in 2016. The Norwegian will now face the Spanish club as United boss, but feels he has “something to sort out with them”. Reacting to the semi-final draw, Solskjaer told MUTV: “Yeah, of course. I was the manager of Molde and we lost against them in 2016. “They beat us 3-0 away, we beat them 1-0 in Molde. “So I’ve got something I need to sort out with them.”

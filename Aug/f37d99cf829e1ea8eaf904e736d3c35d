The Commissioner for Health in Lagos State, Professor Akin Abayomi has said that the state has passed the peak of the Coronavirus pandemic and is currently on the flattening stage. Abayomi who recently revealed that he tested positive for the viral disease, said this in an interview with Nigeria Info FM on Wednesday. Speaking during the interview the health commissioner said from government’s observations, the state has passed the worst of the pandemic. “Lagos might be at its peak in the #COVID19 pandemic but it’s not over yet as we may see an escalation of positive cases. “However, until we see a decline in the number of positive cases we shouldn’t relent. We believe the lockdown was not effective because of the reality of a city where people go out to fend for themselves on a daily basis. “If not you replace a health crisis with an economic crisis. Concerning the number of positive results seen this period, we have sample collection centers in every local government in Lagos, so the more we test the more cases we find. “If there are no more positivity then the outbreak is slowing down. “So our observation is that Lagos has passed the worst of the pandemic, it has passed the peak of the pandemic and is now on the flattening stage and over time will experience a downslope of the virus then the end of COVID19. “There are two categories of testing, ‘the need to know’ for people who have shown symptoms and are a public health concern and ‘the want to know’ those who as a result of business want to get back to work and want to know if they are safe,” he said

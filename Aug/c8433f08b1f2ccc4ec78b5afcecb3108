A possible coup is underway in Mali. This followed nearly three months of demonstrations calling for President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s resignation. Soldiers in Kati town are arresting senior military officers. Tanks and military vehicles are moving round the streets of Kati, 15 kilometers from the capital, Bamako. Government workers in the nearby capital of Bamako are evacuating. “Arrests are being made of officials. It’s total confusion,” an officer at Mali’s Ministry of Internal Security, told journalists.

The United Nations (UN), European Union (EU), African Union (AU) had condemned his government’s use of lethal force on protesters

Barcelona will demand interested clubs pay Lionel Messi’s £631million release clause, if he hands in a transfer request, Mundo Deportivo reports. Messi’s future with the LaLiga giants remain uncertain, after the team performed woefully last season and finished trophyless. The six-time Ballon d’Or winner has been linked with Manchester City, Inter Milan and Paris Saint-Germain. There are reports that some Barcelona board want Messi to leave the club. It is understood that at least one high-ranking member thinks a shock sale would be best for all involved. However, Barca will inform Messi that he can only leave if a club is willing to pay his stunning £631m release clause or he will be staying put. The world-record transfer fee remains the £198m PSG paid for Messi’s former teammate in 2017.

Juventus would be ready to sell Cristiano Ronaldo for offers of £54m and above, according to Sport. Ronaldo is no longer considered ‘untouchable’ at the Italian giants, and they would be willing to do business this summer. The 35-year-old has spent two fantastic seasons in Turin, scoring 65 goals in 89 appearances across all competitions and winning two Serie A titles. However, with the arrival of Andrea Pirlo to replace Maurizio Sarri as manager, there is set to be a squad overhaul at Juve before next season. Paris Saint-Germain are keeping a close eye on Ronaldo’s situation and could be ready to make a move as soon as their Champions League campaign is over. The Ligue 1 champions take on RB Leipzig in the semi-final on Tuesday evening. Juventus will not consider offers of less than €60m (£54m), although that price tag may well not put off PSG.

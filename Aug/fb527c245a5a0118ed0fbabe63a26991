A former Real Madrid and Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted tonight’s Champions League fixture between Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Barcelona will face Bayern in the Champions League last-8 final tie at the Estádio da Luz in Portugal. The La Liga giants head to the game after eliminating Napoli from the Champions League, while the Bundesliga champions knocked out Chelsea from the competition. But Owen expects Bayern to beat Barcelona 2-1 and qualify for the Champions League last-4 final stage. “This is a really tough game to call, but I think Bayern are in better form and with Lewandowski in their ranks, I think the German side will progress to the semi-final with a 2-1 win,” Owen wrote in his column.

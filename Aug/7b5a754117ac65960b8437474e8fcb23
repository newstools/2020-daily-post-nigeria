Manchester United agreed to a pay Alexis Sanchez off, in order to encourage him to leave the club and join Inter Milan on a permanent basis, the UK Telegraph reports. Both clubs announced the transfer on Thursday. Inter were always keen on keeping Sanchez, but refused to pay his £390,000-a-week wages. United were paying a chunk of the Chilean’s salary during his one-year loan spell at the San Siro. The Premier League side have now decided to hand the 31-year-old a hefty sum to leave the club. The figure is believed to be between £5m and £10m. With two years left to run on Sanchez’s contract at Old Trafford, he stood to take home over £40m.

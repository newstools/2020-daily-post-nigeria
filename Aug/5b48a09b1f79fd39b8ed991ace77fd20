The Oyo State Governor, Engineer Makinde, has sacked his Commissioner for Works, Infrastructure and Transport, Professor Raphael Afonja. A letter by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mrs. Olubamiwo Adeosun, said the termination was immediate. Titled “Termination of appointment”, it directed him to hand over all the government items in his possession to the Permanent Secretary (Ministry of Works, Infrastructure and Transport). “I am to add that, your contribution within the time of your sojourn is appreciated and commendable, and therefore, wish you success in your future endeavours. I thank you.” The governor has also approved the redeployment of two commissioners, who were asked to swap portfolios. An internal memo signed by the SSG with the subject: “Redeployment of EXCO members” indicated that the Commissioner for Special Duties, Bayo Lawal, has been moved to the Ministry of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs. His counterpart there, Funmilayo Orisadeyi, is to move to the Ministry of Special Duties. The redeployment also takes immediate effect.

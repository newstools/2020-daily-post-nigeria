The Management and officials of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) have been instructed to undergo coronavirus tests at the federation’s secretariat in Abuja on Thursday. Ademola Olajire, NFF’s Director of Communications, made this known in a statement by the federation’s General Secretary, Mohammed Sanusi on Wednesday. The test became necessary after a member of the NFF management tested positive to coronavirus. “Apart from this person testing positive, Sanusi had issues and went for tests when he was feeling ill and uncomfortable,’’ Olajire added. He quoted Sanusi as saying, “But the truth is (that) most of us have had contact with one another here. Thus, it is important we undergo the tests.’’ NFF General Secretary further announced that the federation’s offices and the entire secretariat complex would be disinfected after the tests in line with the protocols of COVID-19, NAN reports. He also announced that the offices would be closed for the disinfection process after the tests, while management and staff would work from home. “Once the results are out, those who tested negative will immediately resume work in the secretariat while anyone who tested positive will be required to self-isolate for the period stipulated in the COVID-19 protocols by the Federal Government,’’ the statement added.

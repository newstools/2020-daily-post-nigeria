One of Big Brother Naija housemates, Dorathy has revealed why she voted for Lilo’s eviction. Lilo was evicted on Sunday during a live eviction show alongside Ka3na. In a new twist, the ‘Lockdown’ housemates were instructed to pick two housemates out of Lilo, Eric, Praise and Ka3na who had the lowest number of their fan’s votes. At the end of the selection, Lilo and Ka3na got the highest nominations and were evicted. This is the first time housemates in the popular reality show will be voting out housemates from the show. Dorathy was among those who chose Lilo to be evicted. Giving her reason, the housemate speaking with Biggie on Monday during her diary session said she voted Lilo and Eric out because Ka3na and Praise are very close to her. “Voting Lilo was one of the hardest decision, but I saved Ka3na and Praise because I was very close to them. “I will miss their contribution in the house especially in the kitchen,” Dorathy told Biggie. She added that she would like a male housemate to win the head of house because previous head of house have not had 100% control of the house.

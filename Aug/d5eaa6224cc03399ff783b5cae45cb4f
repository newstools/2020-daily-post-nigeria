Edgy, cultural, cosmopolitan yet very relatable as it mirrors life for the ordinary person.” The son of the legendary African Jazz Musician and entertainer Art Alade, Dare Art Alade, professionally known as Darey is a multiple award-winning singer, musician, songwriter, music producer, showstopper extraordinaire and entrepreneur.

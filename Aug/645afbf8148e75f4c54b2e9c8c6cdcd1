We had to quickly call the police to intervene but surprisingly to us, they came late and started watching these thugs attacking and destroying our properties.” Also, the Chairmanship candidate of the party, Mr. Akinselure who confirmed the attack said, “It is true we were attacked and I put a call to the DPO at Olofin Police Station and Deputy Commissioner of Police but it is unfortunate that the policemen who came to the scene of the attack could not do anything to stop the attack.” Meanwhile, the attack led to protest among the supporters of the SDP as they expressed anger towards the attitude of the police during the violence. When contacted, Mr. Tee Leo-Ikoro, Spokesman for the Ondo State Police Command said he was yet to be properly briefed.

Former Minister of Finance, Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has congratulated Dr. Akinwumi Adesina on his re-election as the President of the African Development Bank (AfDB). Okonjo-Iweala, who is also seeking appointment as the Director-General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), sent her best wishes via her Twitter page. “Wonderful to get the news of the re-election of @akin_adesina as President of @AfDB_Group. “Hearty congratulations to you, my brother, and to Grace! Wishing you five more fruitful years!!” she tweeted. Adesina was re-elected to serve for another five years, after re-election during the closing ceremony of the virtual Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the bank on Thursday. An Independent Review Panel had exonerated Adesina of any ethical wrongdoings. The panel was set up by the AfDB Bureau of Governors, following a complaint by the United States.

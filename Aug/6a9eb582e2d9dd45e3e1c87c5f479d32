Bayelsa Governor, Douye Diri, says he will appeal Monday’s ruling of the State Election Petition Tribunal. Diri announced that his lawyers have been instructed to file the necessary papers. The tribunal ruled that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) wrongly excluded the Advanced Nigeria Democratic Party (ANDP) governorship candidate in the November 16, 2019 election. The governor stated that he has implicit confidence in the judiciary that he would triumph in the end. “We trust in the judiciary and we are appealing the judgement. With God on our side, we will get justice. “This is a court of first instance and I have instructed our lawyers to file an appeal. We have a right of appeal even up to the Supreme Court.” Diri urged members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and his supporters not to panic and to continue to remain calm and law-abiding.

The Jigawa State Governor, Mohammadu Abubakar, on Thursday, said President Muhammadu Buhari was not responsible for the hardship being faced by millions of people in the country. He said neither could the President be blamed for the high cost of food items and other goods in the market. The Governor spoke during the commissioning of Digital Economy projects executed by agencies under the supervision of the Federal Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy at the Digital Economy Complex, Mbora, Abuja. According to him, the administration has not only delivered on its campaign promises but has also achieved so much through the various ministries and their parastatals despite the drop in the revenue generation and the advent of COVID-19 pandemic. He insisted the President Buhari had done better than his predecessors in the last five years of his administration with half of resources available to the previous regime during the oil boom. He said the President made the right choice in appointing Dr. Ibrahim Isah Pantami as minister of Communications and Digital Economy, describing him as a round spade in a round hole. “We have achieved a lot under Buhari, more than his predecessor with half of resources available to the previous administration,” he said. “Buhari has done better with half of the resources in five years. When the projects completed under this administration are compared with the last five years, it will be evident that Buhari has done well. Explaining why food items are expensive, Abubakar said “we inherited economy that relied heavily on importation without export substitution. Past leaders have been chronic importers. “Buhari is not responsible for the high cost of food but past leaders, who did not reserve for the future economy. “I urge Nigerians to come out and speak the truth. They should go to the truth of what really happened from inception. “He is not the one who killed the rabbit, he was asked to carry the dead rabbit,” he declared.

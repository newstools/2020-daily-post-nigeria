Barcelona President, Josep Maria Bartomeu, has finally reacted to captain, Lionel Messi’s decision to leave Camp Nou this summer transfer window. Messi had told Barcelona on Sunday that he wants to leave the club this summer following their exit from the Champions League at the hands of Bayern Munich last Friday. The Argentine captain is not happy with the lack of dedication from the Barcelona squad and the way the Blaugrana chiefs are running the club. But Bartomeu has now insisted that Messi will not be sold this summer and will lead the rebuild with new manager, Ronald Koeman. “Messi wants to end his career at Barça and will stay,” Bartomeu told Barcelona TV. “I regularly speak to him and his father. “[Ronald] Koeman counts on him and wants to build the team around him.” Messi’s current contract with Barcelona will end in June 2021. The 33-year-old can leave Barcelona for free once his contract expires.

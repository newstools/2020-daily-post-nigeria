Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, founder of Believers Love World, also known as Christ Embassy Church, has disclosed that God wanted churches to be shut down amid the coronavirus pandemic. Oyakhilome disclosed that God wanted man to reverence him, hence, he allowed churches to be shut down. The clergyman stated this, while addressing his followers. According to Oyakhilome: “What the Lord expects us to do: There was a time the Church didn’t have knowledge of anything going on. “I believe why God allowed the Churches to be shut down was because God wanted to get our attention. “Usually there should be a separation of Church and State. But different leaders started making rules about wearing masks before we worship.” The Nigerian government had ordered the closing down of churches and other worship centres due to COVID-19 outbreak. However, President Muhammadu Buhari had on June 1, lifted the ban on religious gathering across the country.

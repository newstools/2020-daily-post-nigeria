Former President, Goodluck Jonathan, has warned politicians in the country against politics of bitterness and violence. Jonathan tasked politicians to pursue a common interest of development irrespective of political affiliations. Former Jonathan, the interest of the nation should come first, while noting that the purpose of politics was not to divide the people. The former President stated this during a virtual conference organized by a cultural association, Ijaw Nation Development Group (INDG). “To the politicians amongst us, let us shun politics of bitterness and violence and pursue our common interest, regardless of party affiliations,” Jonathan said. “Politics is not about creating and fighting enemies, it is not about dividing the people. Politics is about aspiring for a platform and the ability to utilise it to positively impact our people and develop the nation. “Irrespective of party differences, let us forge a common agenda that will promote peace, unity and prosperity among our people.” Jonathan said he would like to see the people play key roles in the emergence of those who leads them and how they are led. The former President who accepted defeat in 2015 noted social crisis drags nation backward more than anything else. Furthermore, the immediate past Nigeria’s President stressed that the people must aspire to build bridges that would sustain a national climate of peace and progress regardless of the challenges.

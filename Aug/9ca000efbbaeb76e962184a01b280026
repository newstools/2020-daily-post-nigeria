Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, is keen on bringing Gareth Bale back to the club, according to ElEspanol. Bale played for the North London club between 2007 and 2013, before leaving for Spain in a then world record fee of £86million. However, the Welshman’s time in Madrid has not gone as planned, as he has been frozen out by Zinedine Zidane. Bale now has been left with only two options: stagnating at Madrid or returning to Tottenham. Mourinho is keen to offer Bale a chance to get his career back on track, having tried to sign the player while he was Manchester United boss. However, a huge stumbling block that has prevented the 31-year-old from leaving Madrid, has been his massive £350,000-a-week wages after tax.

Pro-Democracy and human rights group, Concerned Nigerians, has called the attention of President, Muhammadu Buhari to the death sentence on Kano singer, Yahaya Sharif-Aminu. DAILY POST reported during the week that an Upper Sharia Court in Kano had sentenced the singer to death over blasphemy. The group also wrote the State Governor, Umar Ganduje and the US Embassy over the court’s ruling. The religious court also allows Aminu to appeal the ruling within 30 days even though he did not deny the charges. In the letter addressed to Buhari, Ganduje and the US embassy, the group said judgement is repulsive to natural justice, equity and good conscience. The Concerned Nigerians also frowned at the attempt to religiously police the country, saying that the country is a secular state. “Our constitution forbids religious policing in section 10, which prohibits the practice of state religion in any part of Nigeria and section 38 guarantees the right to freedom of thought, religion and conscience, including freedom to change religion and belief.” “We are appealing to the president and The American Embassy to prevail on the Kano state Governor to pardon the victim of this great injustice as his life is in serious danger at the Kano Central Prison where he’s being detained.” The group said it was in touch with the convicted musician, revealing that he is currently being kept under the worst possible conditions.

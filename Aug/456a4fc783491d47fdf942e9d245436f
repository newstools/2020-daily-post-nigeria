Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, did not enter the dressing room or speak to his players after they were dumped out of the Champions League last week. City were beaten 3-1 by Lyon, after conceding two late Moussa Dembele goals. Kevin De Bruyne had earlier cancelled out Maxwell Cornet’s opener. The defeat meant City were eliminated from the quarter-final stage for a third season in a row, having emerged big favourites during the mini-tournament in Lisbon. City defender, Aleksander Zinchenko, has now opened up on Guardiola’s reaction after the full-time whistle. Zincheko told his partner, Vlada Seden, on her YouTube channel: “Guardiola didn’t even enter the locker room, and didn’t say a word after the match. What is there to say, if everything is clear? “It’s a shame for David Silva and Claudio Bravo – they played their last match for Manchester City. We wanted to win first of all for them.”

There is palpable tension in Jangeme village in Gusau, capital of Zamfara State as unknown bandits have threatened to attack the village if the villagers failed to give them the sum of N7m. DAILY POST gathered that the bandits said the ransom became necessary after seven of the villagers kidnapped by the bandits last week escaped when negotiation on how to pay the ransom was ongoing. Consequently, the bandits are demanding a sum of seven million naira from the kidnapped victims who had escaped from their den as ransom or the village would be set on fire. One of the villagers, Malam Bashari Jangeme, told DAILY POST that most of the villagers have deserted the village due to the fear of the threat. “Most of us have moved out of the village because we know that the bandits will attack us at any time as we cannot pay the money they are demanding,” he said. According to one of the escaped victims, Aminu Sarki, they escaped when the bandits were asleep, pointing out that they trekked for two days before they could get to the main road. All efforts to get the reaction of the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Mohammed Shehu, failed as he did not pick his calls after many attempts.

Real Madrid are so desperate to land Paulo Dybala and will offer Juventus two first-team players, according to SportMediaset. It is understood that the two players Real Madrid will offer to force the deal are: Isco and Toni Kroos. Zinedine Zidane’s side have contacted the Serie A champions and proposed a mammoth swap deal for Dybala that could exceed €100million (£90m). The La Liga champions are desperate to bolster their attack this summer after their exit from this year’s Champions League at the hands of Manchester City. The Los Blancos have been far too reliant on striker, Karim Benzema, for goals, with their next highest scorer being defender, Sergio Ramos on 11 – most of which have been penalties. Meanwhile, Juventus have little desire to let Dybala leave and intend to resist Real’s interest, though they are conscious of the need to raise funds for new signings and that stance could change. The Old Lady were eliminated from the Champions League in the last 16 against French Ligue 1 side, Lyon and reacted immediately by sacking manager, Maurizio Sarri, and replacing him with Andrea Pirlo.

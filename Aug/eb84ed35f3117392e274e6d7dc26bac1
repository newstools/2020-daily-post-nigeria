The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, on Tuesday, said the people of South West have lost confidence in the security network, codenamed,’ Operation Amotekun’. Pastor Giwa said Amotekun has been hijacked by politicians contrary to the initial motives. Giwa’s reaction followed the statement made by the Presidency that activities of the security outfit would be determined and controlled by the Inspector-General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu. Operation Amotekun is an initiative of the governors in the South-West geopolitical zone of Nigeria. It is a security outfit that was created with the aim of protecting lives and property within the states. However, Giwa faulted the decision of the Federal government to control Amotekun. In a statement he signed and forwarded to DAILY POST, Giwa said: “I don’t see Amotekun protecting the South West if they insist to control it. Nothing, absolutely will function well under politicians or the Federal government. “I lost confidence in the security outfit the moment politicians involved themselves in the process. You don’t have power more than your master. “Anything a government dictates to the group, it shall do. We must not deceive ourselves, there won’t be freedom for them to do the job very well.”

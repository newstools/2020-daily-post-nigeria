Former Governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose, has attacked ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo over his comments in reaction to the death of Senator Buruji Kashamu. Fayose said that Nigerians will watch out for the end of Obasanjo, warning the former President against acting like a saint. DAILY POST reported on Saturday that Kashamu died of COVID-19 related issues. And in reaction, Obasanjo said despite using politics to maneuver the law to escape justice, Kashamu could not escape death. The former lawmaker found himself in a legal tussle with the government anti-corruption agencies which led to his planned extradition to the US, over alleged drug trafficking. Obasanjo’s comment angered Fayose, who believes that the former President at some point collaborated with Kashamu. Fayose condemned the statement made by Obasanjo, stating that “It is regrettable that the former President could make such comments about the departed politician.” According to Fayose, Obasanjo was making this comment when Buruji Kashamu can no longer question him, wondering “Why didn’t he say that when [he] was alive? “Can Obasanjo say in good conscience that he did not at some point collaborated with Kashamu and most of the things he (Kashamu) did politically were not with his collaboration? “Nigerians will watch out for Obasanjo’s own end. He should stop forming saint because he is not. He should also remember that his own end will come too and nobody knows how the end will be.” Fayose, who commiserated with the bereaved family, describing his death as an irreparable loss, also prayed for the repose of his soul.

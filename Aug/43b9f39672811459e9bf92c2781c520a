Barcelona’s Luis Suarez has spoken for the first time, since he was told by new manager Ronald Koeman, to leave the club. The 33-year-old has been linked with his former club Ajax and MLS side Inter Miami ever since. However, in an Instagram post, Suarez insists he will speak about his future when the time is right. He wrote: “There are people using my name and saying things about me, people that I’ve had nothing to do within years. “I’ll speak for myself when that time comes about.” Suarez could be joined out of the exit door by Lionel Messi, who is pushing for a move away on a free transfer.

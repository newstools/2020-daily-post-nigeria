Governor Akeredolu of Ondo State has faulted the state’s electoral body, ODIEC for its inability to supply the necessary voting materials needed for the local government election held on Saturday in the state. Akeredolu shortly after voting at unit 6, ward 5, Ijebu-Owo in Owo Local Government Area of the state alongside his wife, Betty, alleged that the commission erred by not supplying adequate voting materials to some of the polling units. Many of the polling units had witnessed the late arrival of electoral materials and the ODIEC personnel while some voters protested the development. While describing the exercise as rancour-free, the governor said the polls would allow Ondo State residents to democratically choose their leaders at the grassroots. A total of 10 political parties are participating in the election excluding the major opposition parties in the state such as the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Zenith Labour Party, ZLP and Social Democratic Party, SDP. According to the PDP, the election was boycotted to ensure that the process was not given credibility.

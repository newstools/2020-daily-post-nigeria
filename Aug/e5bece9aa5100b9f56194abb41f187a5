Zamfara State Governor, Bello Matawalle, has said that the state will be among the richest in Nigeria if President Muhammadu Buhari government supports his plans. The governor said this when he visited the Head Office of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) in Abuja. He described poverty as a vehicle to massive and pervasive sickness. Matawalle said his administration was doing everything possible to improve the earning capacity of the government and his people. “We are building health facilities at the grassroots so that the hinterland can have access to primary healthcare. We have equipped all our 23 General Hospitals with brand-new ambulances and health equipment to boost secondary healthcare system.” The governor disclosed that 147 Primary Healthcare Centers are being built in each ward in the state. He added that his administration welcomes the full participation of NHIS in Zamfara. NHIS Executive Secretary, Prof. Mohammed Sambo, assured of the agency’s support and commended Matawalle’s fight against banditry which he noted discouraged professionals from the state.

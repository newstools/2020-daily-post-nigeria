Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator has reacted as President Muhammadu Buhari orders the rejigging of operational strategies of Nigeria’s security network. Buhari had said the measure would effectively counter the security situation in Nigeria. The President’s directive was disclosed by the National Security Adviser, NSA, Major General Babagana Mungono, rtd, after the National Security Council meeting held at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. However, Sani urged Buhari to sack those who have failed in ensuring the protection of Nigerians from bandits and terrorists. In a tweet, the former lawmaker wrote: “Whether overhauling the nation’s security ‘apparatus’ or redesigning the nation’s security ‘architecture’ or resetting the nation’s security ‘structure.’ “Just sack those who failed in their duty to protect the people from Bandits and terrorists and replace them with those who will deliver.”

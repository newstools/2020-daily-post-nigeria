It was gathered that the old hardworking driver depends only on commercial driving as his means of livelihood with one wife, six children and two elderly dependents. According to some reports, Malam Kiri sometimes finds it very difficult to afford three square meals for his family and always unable to provide for his children’s education. Despite his financial challenges, Kari chose to remain an honest man even when he had the opportunity to enrich himself fraudulently. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-834566 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598608966787.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598608966787.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598608966787-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> It was in recognition of this rare sterling quality that Network for Yobe Civil Society Organisations, (NYCSO),

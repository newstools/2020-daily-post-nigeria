Lagos State Government has directed the JSS3 students who are registered for National Examination Council (NECO) Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) to resume on Monday, August 10, to prepare for the examination slated to commence on August 24. This, according to the government, is in furtherance to the earlier pronouncement directing SS3 and Technical Studies (TEC3) students in the state to resume on Monday, August 3, 2020 to enable them revise and sit for their forthcoming West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) and NABTEB. However, the Commissioner for Education, Mrs. Folasade Adefisayo, who made the pronouncement in her office at the Secretariat, Alausa, Ikeja, said the JSS3 students who are waiting to write BECE organized by the Lagos State Examinations Board are exempted from resuming. She said: “Only those students who are registered for NECO BECE which is scheduled to commence on the 24th of August, 2020 are permitted to resume, other JSS3 students waiting to write BECE organized by the Lagos State Examinations Board would soon be informed of the scheduled dates of their examination.” The Commissioner stated that administrators of both public and private schools are expected to ensure full compliance with the COVID-19 guidelines for schools re-opening in their respective schools as the State Government’s officials will be on ground to monitor situations in all schools across the State. While urging students to be fully prepared for the forthcoming examinations and devote more time to their studies, the Commissioner explained that government has made appropriate arrangements to make learning conducive and the conduct of the examination successful. She, however, urged students and members of staff to adhere strictly to proper hygienic guidelines and ensure the provision of sanitizers, wash hand basin, thermometers and other essential items in public and private schools across the State, stressing that the washing of hands, wearing of face masks and the maintenance of social distancing must be adhered to.

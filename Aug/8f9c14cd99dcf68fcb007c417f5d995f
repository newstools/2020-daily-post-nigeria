Barcelona on Tuesday announced the sack of sporting director Eric Abidal. This came one day after coach Quique Setien was fired. Like Setien, Abidal was booted out after the club’s ouster from the UEFA Champions League, Reuters reports. Barcelona was last week whipped 8-2 by Bayern Munich. Abidal had been in the role for over two years. He won the UEFA Champions League as a Barca player. “The club would publicly like to thank Éric Abidal for his professionalism, commitment, dedication and the close and positive nature of his relationship with all aspects of the Barca family,” Barca club said in a statement.

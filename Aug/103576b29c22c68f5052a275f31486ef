The founder of Omega Fire Ministries, Apostle Johnson Suleman has decried the “lawless” activities of some officers of the Nigeria Police Force, NPF. Apostle Suleman lamented that some policemen were lawless and trigger-happy. In a tweet via his verified Twitter handle, the clergyman claimed that some of these police officers run from criminals only to victimize young boys. “I am ashamed to see how most Nigerian policemen have become so lawless and trigger-happy. “You run from criminals and victimize young boys, I don’t support crime but not every face-cap, jewellery-wearing, jeans-loving young man is a crook. STOP THE TERROR,” he tweeted. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-824761 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200804_181737_934.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="773" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200804_181737_934.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200804_181737_934-279x300.jpg 279w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/IMG_20200804_181737_934-560x600.jpg 560w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

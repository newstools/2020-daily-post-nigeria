A Senior Special Assistant from Urhonigbe South ward 8, Faith Obasuyi, at the early hours on Friday, tendered her resignation letter from the services of the Edo State government. Barr Faith in her resignation letter stated that the recent activities of the present administration led by Gov Godwin Obaseki will not lead to the actualization of development and the promotion of woman and girl-child interest. According to her, ‘I’m, therefore, not persuaded that the recent activities of the Gov Obaseki administration can lead me to achieving these interest especially when the governor has now abandoned the APC on whose back he rode to power. ‘This decision is borne out of my desire to join forces with our great party, the APC to ensure the emergence of a true Orhionmwon man as governor come September 19th, 2020.” Meanwhile, the vice-chairman of Orhionmwon Local Government Area, Hon Christian Iweka has also dumped the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP for the APC. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-828779 size-full" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1597401711518.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="967" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1597401711518.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1597401711518-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px">

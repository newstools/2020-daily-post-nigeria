Chelsea on Saturday night made two Champions League records after their exit from the competition at the hands of Bayern Munich. Bayern defeated Chelsea 4-1 in Germany to qualify for the last eight of the Champions on 7-1 aggregate, having won Lampard’s men 2-0 in the first leg at Stamford Bridge in February. Robert Lewandowski, Ivan Perisic and Corentin Tolisso all scored for Bayern. Tammy Abraham netted a goal for Frank Lampard’s side. However, according to OptaJoe, Chelsea’s 7-1 defeat on aggregate to Bayern was the second-heaviest inflicted on an English team in Champions League history, behind only Arsenal’s 10-2 aggregate defeat in the last-16 in 2016-2017 campaign, also against Bayern Munich. Also, Chelsea conceded 79 goals in all competitions in the 2019/2020 season, an average of 1.44 per game, their worst ratio in a season since the 1990/1991 campaign (1.64 goals per game conceded).

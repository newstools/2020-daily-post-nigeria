Mavin Producer and fan of BBNaija, Don Jazzy has criticised those slamming Erica for having sex with fellow housemate Kiddwaya. Erica and Kiddwaya were on Sunday night seen on television having sex under the duvet. Her action has since stirred reactions from fans as some described her as a lady without self control despite just a few weeks into the reality show. However, Don Jazzy, reacting on his Twitter page described those criticising Erica as hypocrites. Alongside a picture of Erica, Don Jazzy wrote: “I like both your straight face, smiling face and moaning face sef. “People that if they leave them they will use cucumber on national tv want to counsel somebody that fell for a fine rich boy. Hypocrites. Hiss.” The Mavin Producer also addressing those describing Kiddwaya’s as a player said if he ends up disappointing Erica, life would move on. “Genuine or no genuine, we don’t know that yet. She likes him for now. E Dey happen. If he fucks up like most of us guys do. Life goes on. Na today, ” his tweet added.

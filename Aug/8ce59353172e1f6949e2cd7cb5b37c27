Sixteen persons have reportedly been killed, hundreds of houses destroyed and farmlands washed away in flooding that ravaged seven local government areas in Jigawa State. Executive Secretary, Jigawa State Emergency Management Agency Yusuf Sani, disclosed this in an exclusive interview with DAILY POST in Dutse. He said the flooding was caused by a heavy downpour in the areas last week. The affected areas include Taura, Jahun, Babura, Ringim, Dutse, Birnin Kudu, Miga, Kafin-Hausa, Auyo, Gwaram, Malam-Madori, Birniwa and Kaugama local government area. Yusuf explained that lives were lost when a building collapsed during the rains while many sustained various degrees of injuries. He added that the flood had also washed away thousands of farmlands, destroying farm products in the area. Yusuf said the state emergency management agency is working to assess the level of damage and the number of persons affected. He, however, warned people against nonchalant attitude towards dredging of culverts, especially during the raining season.

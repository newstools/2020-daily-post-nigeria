The Kano State Public and Anti-Corruption Commission said it is currently interrogating the Special Adviser on Religious Affairs to Governor Umar Ganduje, Ali Baba Fagge, for alleged embezzlement of clericsâ€™ funds. Ali Baba is facing criminal charges for allegedly slashing funds meant for selected prayer warriors invited by the state government to pray for Kano and Nigeria. Governor Ganduje was said to have sponsored about 336 religious leaders to pray for Kano/Nigeria against coronavirus and insecurity in the nation. However, the Special Adviser on Religious Affairs, Ali Baba Kagama Lafiya, who is responsible for supporting the Ullamas with money provided by the government, was accused of slashing the funds. Chairman of Kano State Public Complaints and Anti-Corruption Commission, Muhuyi Magaji Rimingado, said he has received complaints of an alleged deduction of money meant for some religious leaders in the state by Fagge. The anti-graft commission boss confirmed the launch of investigation against Ali Baba to newsmen in Kano. The Special Adviser was alleged to have slashed some amounts from the N50,000 given to each Ulama recently after a special prayer session organized by the government. However, a source closed to the anti-corruption body said the adviser is still in their custody facing some interrogations alongside his children who are alleged accomplices in the case.

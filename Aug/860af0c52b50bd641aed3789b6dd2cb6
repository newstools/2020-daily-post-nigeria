Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Vee has expressed fear over her relationship with Neo outside the house. Vee and Neo are one of BBNaija lockdown lovers in this year’s show. Vee on Monday during her visit to HOH room told Nengi about love and fame affecting her relationship with Neo outside the house. According to her, Neo has self control but she is scared that fame might change him. “Neo is a good person and has self control and I’m confident about that but I had a friend before this show that had fame and said he cannot have a relationship without cheating. “Neo can come out now and one sugar mummy would give him Range Rover, I’m just scared you don’t know how fame can change you,” Vee told Nengi.

Chelsea are close to agreeing on deals to sign Bayer Leverkusen midfielder, Kai Havertz, Leicester left-back Ben Chilwell and former Paris Saint-Germain captain Thiago Silva, Sky Sport reports. Havertz is now set to move to Stamford Bridge, with the Blues close to completing a deal with Leverkusen that could be worth up to £90m. Frank Lampard is also set to add Chilwell to his squad, with talks between them and Leicester continuing on Monday. The England fullback is understood to be keen on the move and it is believed the deal is “almost there”. While Havertz, 21 and Chilwell, 23, would add youth to Chelsea’s squad, Thiago Silva would provide some much-needed experience in defence. Chelsea conceded 54 Premier League goals last season and 35-year-old Silva would be expected to help rectify the problem. Silva is available on a free transfer after leaving PSG following defeat in the Champions League final and will sign a two-year deal.

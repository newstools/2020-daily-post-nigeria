FA Cup champions, Arsenal, have made a massive new contract offer to captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. According to The Times, Arsenal have upped their contract offer to Aubameyang and are now prepared to pay him £300,000-a-week to remain at Emirates. Aubameyang will earn in excess of £300,000-a-week including bonus payments in his proposed new contract, up from the £200,000-a-week base salary he currently earns. He will also receive a one-off payment of £300,000 due to a clause in his current contract requiring him to score or assist at least 25 goals, a benchmark he reached in the Premier League on the final day of the season against Watford. The new deal would make Aubameyang the second-highest earner at Arsenal behind only Mesut Ozil, though Arsenal would ideally like to offload the ex-Germany international this summer. Aubameyang fired the Gunners to their 14th FA Cup trophy last Saturday with a 2-1 victory over Chelsea and the club’s manager, Mikel Arteta is desperate for the Gabon striker to sign a new contract. The 31-year-old’s current contract at Arsenal is in its final year. He joined Arsenal from Bundesliga giants, Borussia Dortmund in 2018.

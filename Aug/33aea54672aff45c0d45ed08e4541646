The Governor of Akwa Ibom State, Emmanuel Udom, on Monday, said that a candidate of the West Africa Examination Council Examination has tested positive to coronavirus. Speaking during a media chat in Uyo, the Governor said the affected student is asymptomatic.
Udom further disclosed that they will be ensuring the student does not miss out on anything from the class.
“We have tested over 100 students and it is only one young man that tested positive for the virus in the state. “We did what we ought to do medically and I want to believe that by now, the young man should be okay.
“All of them are in excellent health condition because we have put everything in place to ensure that the students are quite safe. “I also have directed all my Special Assistants to go to all the schools and monitor the level of compliance with the safety protocols and give us feedback in case of any emergency.
“Students observed all COVID-19 protocols before starting their examination. “We want to make sure our students are safe even while writing the examination,” he said. He further stated that they have provided over 100,000 face masks and sanitizers to the schools writing the examination across the state. “Based on the report I have, I think the students are doing well; it is left for them to reciprocate by giving us excellent WAEC result,” he added.

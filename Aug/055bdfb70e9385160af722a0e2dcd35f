A coalition of Ullamas has attacked Human Rights Organizations for criticism against the sharia death sentence on a singer Aminu Sharif Yahya. The coalition through its Chairman Professor Musa Muhammad Borodo asked Human Right Organizations to devote their energy in promoting mutual respect and social cohesion in society rather than parroting the perverted ideological inclination of their foreign paymasters. “We strongly reiterate the calls on so-called Human Rights activities to always consider larger interests above parochial tendencies”. Professor Musa Borodo maintained that blasphemy does not constitute freedom of expression. Borodo confirmed that the coalition supports the judicial ruling against Aminu Sharif. “We commend the dispassionate discharge of duty on the part of the Nigeria Police as well as the Court that tried the case”. ”We are delighted over the peaceful maturity of the peoples of Kano who despite all provocations on the matter remained calmed until judgment was passed”. He warned that the issue, if not carefully handled, might result in serious catastrophe.

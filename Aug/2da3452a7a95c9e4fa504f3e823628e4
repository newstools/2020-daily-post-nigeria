Big Brother Naija, BBNaija, housemate, Prince has disclosed why he’s reluctant to get into a relationship on the reality television show. Prince stated that getting into a relationship would affect his chances of getting prettier girls when he leaves Big Brother House. He disclosed this during a discussion with fellow housemate, Erica on Sunday night. According to Prince, some of the girls who had turned down his advances may likely reconsider him because he was on the BBNaija show. “I said I wasn’t going to get into a relationship in this house, because I have more chances of getting a finer babe when I leave. All the chics that were ignoring my DM, when I come out they fit don DM me,” Prince said. Recall that Prince who seems to have interest in Nengi had recently disclosed that the latter must pick between him and Ozo.

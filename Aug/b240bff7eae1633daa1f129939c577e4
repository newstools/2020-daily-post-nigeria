Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has been criticized for a lack of respect, by one of the club’s presidential candidates, Toni Freixa. Messi on Tuesday, officially informed the LaLiga giants, of his desire to leave this summer. The 33-year-old who joined the club in 2001, is keen for another experience, after playing all his career. But Freixa, who is a former Barca director, insists he is not bothered about Messi’s decision. “I am not overly concerned about Messi leaving because everything has an end,” he told Radio Marca. “What is important is that he did it in such an unfortunate way and without respecting the club.” Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain are front-runners to land Messi, but Freixa has made it clear that the player’s massive release clause must be paid in full. “The contracts are to be fulfilled and what Messi has to do is come with €700m (£628m) and leave,” he added

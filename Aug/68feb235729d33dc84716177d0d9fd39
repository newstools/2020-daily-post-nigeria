Arsenal’s new signing, Willian, has asked Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to stay at the club. Aubameyang has become the Gunners’ most influential player, since he arrived from Borussia Dortmund in 2018, netting 70 goals in 109 appearances. The 31-year-old has entered the final year of his contract and is yet to put pen to paper on fresh terms, with fans fearful the club might have to sell him. Willian, who himself recently signed a three-year deal with Arsenal, has said he is desperate to link up with Aubameyang. He told SunSport: “I joined Arsenal because we can challenge for titles but Pierre will be a big part of the plan. “He has to stay – it is very important to me. This is a guy who gets 25-30 goals a season and we have to keep a player like that. “He’s one of the best players in our team and somebody I want to be making chances for.”

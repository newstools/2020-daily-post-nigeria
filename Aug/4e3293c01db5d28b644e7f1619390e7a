In USA to be precise, You don’t have to have all the money before you buy car, You can approach your bank to help you, After helping you to secure a good car you can then pay in installment for 3 years, Same thing applicable to house, You can buy a house and pay for the next 30 years which is recognize as mortgage. Our finance program is a short term program and not long term. When we help you get a good car at auction, You pay for the cost of buying alone and you make a balance available when the car get to Nigeria. This is to minimized the risk of paying 100% and to reduce the burden on your neck. PAY ATTENTION TO THESE BELOW 1.TAMPERED ODOMETER: Going by the above information, you will agree with us that you are not only buying a wrong car but also spending more money on a car that can’t last you for years meaning that you won’t enjoy the desired value for your money. Many cars in Nigeria called “Tokunbo” are not actually what they call them but repackaged or refurbished. When you start driving, you will discover that you are not only driving a car but a piece of scrap. Researched has shown us that 43% of vehicles you buy from car dealers in Nigeria have their odometers tampered with. What we are saying here is that most vehicles have about 300,000 (Three Hundred Thousand Mileage) (exceeded limit) odometers but as soon as the car comes to Nigeria they will go and reduce it to 30,000 thus faking it as a real odometer. Car Auction Broker in Lagos will help you verify it through their software before buying. Do you know that the higher your odometers the higher the risk of buying bad engines? Now, stop being deceived by the body of the car but rather pay attention to the internal of the car. Our advice is for you to always get a VIN number (Vehicle Identification Number) of any car you want to buy and send it to us at copart auction broker in Lagos, Even if you are not getting your car through us we will still help you with a comprehensive report of the car with less than #4000(Four Thousand Naira Only). 2. DEFLATED AIRBAG. Sometimes we buy car that looks very beautiful outside but we tend to forget that what matter are the internal features of the car and not the body. Why should you buy a car that does not have any airbag(s) or the airbag has shifted position? Do you know that 58% of those cars you see along the Lagos and Ibadan expressway do not have airbags at all? Yes, let us shock you, most cars you also see have their airbag shifted from the position it ought to be. You will all agree with us that airbag works with an emergency situation and whenever there is an emergency, the airbag will come out but some situations whereby the airbag wanted to come out and don’t, then there is a tendency that the airbag is not intact and these kinds of car are what the dealers will buy and sell to you. NOTE: This article is not to discredit any business but to show clearly to Nigerians that you need a car with an intact airbag rather than use your hand to buy wrong car. This is why Car 1960 Limited will help you. We will help you process the buying of your car and not make away with your money(Delivery Guaranteed). Please, make sure you come and know our office and sign our papers before dealing and avoid sending money to any individual or company you do not know. 3 .FIXED FLOOD VEHICLES: Nigerians should also be aware here that they don’t have to buy car in the name of the body but making sure you get the Vehicle Identification Number done for the car you are buying and it is better you spend less on getting the full history of your car before placing money on it than to ignore the report and go and place millions on buying a car from the car dealers. The purpose of running a background check on any car is to know the true condition of the mileage plus our physical check through our foreign partners to be sure of the history of the engine. Do you know that 40% of cars in Nigeria tend to have flood history? for those that have travelled abroad will understand what we are saying or for those that love to watch CNN (cable news) you will understand what is meant to buy flood vehicles. A flood vehicle is a car that has been affected by SALTY WATER. The good news is that it is very cheap to buy in the auction but the bad news is that there is no way you will ever enjoy the car because one issues or the other will keep coming up all the time. Do away with any flood car and go as a matter of fact to get the report of a car before buying. We can help you at cars1960. 4.PROGRAMMED ENGINE. The most important thing in a car is the SOUND ENGINE, what shall it profit you as a buyer to go and buy a car with a bad engine. Many times, buyers tend to make mistakes when it comes to understanding the secret of buying cars in Nigeria. You will end up buying a smoking engine. What is a programmed engine car? It is a car with an engine problem and the insurance company decide to go and fixed the engine and send it to the auction in order to deceive the intending buyer, by the time the dealer purchase such cars and bring it to Nigeria and repackaged it, then it becomes a problem for the end-users and that is why Car 1960 limited has come in to help Nigerians to finance their car buying. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-827038 size-large" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PHOTO-2020-08-08-18-54-03-1024x562.jpg" alt="" width="740" height="406" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PHOTO-2020-08-08-18-54-03-1024x562.jpg 1024w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PHOTO-2020-08-08-18-54-03-300x165.jpg 300w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/PHOTO-2020-08-08-18-54-03.jpg 1080w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"> Anyone that wants to buy a car through our Auto Finance Program should come to our office, pick our form or if you need any of our representatives to come to you in Lagos, then schedule an appointment and we will be with you within 24 hours.

Buying/Auctioning: This is a process of searching for the car of your choice for you, send you two pictures together will be 10 pictures or link to view and we go ahead and bid for it after you have told us your budget, Sign our agreement, Then start bidding and after we have won the bid you will be notified through email notification and you go ahead and pay for the cost of buying only. (You can only pay into company bank account)You will not pay anything until the car gets to Nigeria. We will not release the original bill of lading until you pay for the total invoice, at that stage, you can decide to engage your clearing agent if you desire to do so. The reason we decide to give out these offers is to reduce the risk of you paying 100% to the dealers or any auctioneers in Nigeria. Let us help you carry the risk, we have enough fund and resources to handle just 10 clients in every 60 days. Follow the instructions and pay our balance as at when due and that is why you need to read our terms very well and consult your lawyer before dealing as we don’t want it to look as if we lure you to transact with us as we don’t have time for litigation. Our job is to deliver to you as at the time promised and you introduce another person to us and that is our joy and that is what we have been enjoying. ∙ TRUCKING: This is the movement of vehicle from the point of sale at the auction to the shipper or shipping company. In a developed country like the United States, they do not allow any auctioned car to be driven on their road. The reason being that if there is any loss or accident and the car does not have insurance, it will be difficult for the buyer here to get his/her car because there will be nobody to pay back or cover the loss because the car has no insurance. That is why we will engage the help of the trucking company to help us carry the car and load it to the back of their FLAT bed and get it down to the shipping company, usually, it is the shipping company that helps us pick up the car and book it for shipping immediately. Usually, the cost of Trucking depends on the location of the auction, for example, it is good to buy a car from NEW JERSEY, FLORIDA, HOUSTON TEXAS, SOUTH/NORTH CAROLINA, BALTIMORE, MARYLAND, PHILADEPHIA, VIRGINIA, BOSTON and many more, These cities are closer to the port of loading and it costs less for trucking rather than buying from CALIFORNIA, LOSS ANGELES, CHICAGO, OREGON or any east coast in the United States, The cost of buying from these cities for trucking is enough to buy a new auction vehicle and that is why we advised our clients to allow us suggest location and the car they intend to buy for them. Please, note that you are seeking our assistance because you already know that we are professionals. So, allow us to do our best for you. We need to budget a sum of $550 for any car from the first nearby pick-up rather than paying $1800 for trucking because of the far location. Please note that we are the one responsible for paying for this trucking as well. Until the car gets here, you don’t pay anything. SHIPPING: Shipping is the movement of cars from the United States to the point of delivery (NIGERIA). It is the movement of cars from the United States to Nigeria. It costs $1,100 for shipping and which includes the delivery of bill of lading to our office in Lagos, irrespective of where the car is coming from in the United States. That is the price we will charge you and since we are responsible for this, that is what we will charge you even though some companies will charge you less but that is our price. Remember, however, that you are not paying for this as we are responsible for it. CLEARING: This is the situation whereby your car gets to Nigeria and you want us to help you clear it or get it out from the port of entry in TINCAN or APAPA. At this point, you as a customer, need to decide what you want to do with the car that we just brought in. You have every opportunity to tell us not to do the clearing; maybe because you just got a very smart clearing agent that tell you that you will get a Toyota Corolla 2015 cleared for One Million Naira and you just listened and send money to him, even if the car comes out of the port, the car will never move outside Lagos as we can assure you that the Customs men will never let it move any longer from that spot. Custom duty is very important and needs to be paid if you want our company to help you clear your vehicle as we will never do any short payment, There is benchmark on what the customs charges which is 35% but there is what they call compromised valuation which we will recommend for you while doing the clearance. In a simple sentence, a compromised valuation is a situation whereby you pay a reasonable amount as a customs duty instead of short payment, a compromised value is good as far as the valuation emanates from the customs department. The money we are using to fund these projects is from our foreign investor and we can’t afford to lose it to client that will owe us and that is why we will do everything to secure our end, Walk into our main office in the address below and we assure you will be glad you did and cars 1960 company in Lagos deliver whatever they promise.

The African Action Congress (AAC) has threatened to take legal action against the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for substituting the name of its Ondo deputy governorship candidate with an unknown one. AAC disclosed this in a statement in Akure on Sunday by Mr Oluwasunkanmi Oni, State Publicity Secretary and Mr Alex Adeniyi, State Chairman. DAILY POST reports that INEC on Friday released the list of candidates of the 17 political parties that would participate in the October 10 governorship election in the state. “AAC Ondo State Chapter wishes to register her displeasure on the list released by INEC on the Ondo State governorship election of participating political parties. “Prince Adekunle Adeleye’s name and Mrs Mopelola Evelyn Ibrahim, the Deputy Governorship candidate, were duly sent to INEC as governorship and deputy governorship candidates of the party, respectively. “It’s, therefore, saddening that INEC went on to manufacture an unknown deputy governorship candidate, namely Samuel Tope Omotosho, who is totally unknown to ACC, either in Ondo State or anywhere in Nigeria. “We demand INEC to abjure her errors at once and replace the unrecognized name (Samuel Tope Omotosho) with the authentic name (Mrs Mopelola Evelyn Ibrahim) submitted to them by ACC or face legal action. “Enough of this inglorious act of INEC meddling with and distorting the internal affairs of political parties, AAC inclusive, each time there is an election. “The AAC rejected in its entirety the unknown name paired with Prince Adekunle Adeleye, our party’s Gubernatorial Candidate, as running mate,” the party said.

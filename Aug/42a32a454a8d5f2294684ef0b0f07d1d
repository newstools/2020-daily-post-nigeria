President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the death of Rear Admiral Olufemi Olumide. The President, in a statement made available to DAILY POST by Femi Adesina, his Spokesman, condoled with family and friends of former Federal Commissioner for Works. He noted that Olumide served meritoriously in the military, rising to the peak of his career as a Naval Officer before retirement. The statement said that Buhari “commiserates with professional colleagues of the former minister, and Igbobi College Old Boys Association, urging them to find comfort in the good works of the deceased.” He noted that “He played a strategic role in infrastructure development across the country as a trained Mechanical Engineer. “As one of the pioneers of the National Institute for Policy and Strategic Studies, and an engineer that attended many special courses at home and abroad the rich experiences and knowledge of Rear Admiral Olumide will be sorely missed.” He prayed that the almighty God will receive the soul of the departed, and comfort his family.

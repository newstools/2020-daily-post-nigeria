The Osun State Police Command has provided an update on Ago Egharevbe, the dismissed inspector who brutalized one Ayomide Taiwo. The incident led to death of the 20-year-old fashion designer. Police Public Relations Officer, SP Yemisi Opalola, in a statement on Sunday, said Egharevbe “will be charged to court on Monday for murder.” Egharevbe was attached to Obokun Divisional Police Station. Opalola warned that the police would not condone any act of indiscipline, brutality or unprofessional behaviour. “CP Adie and the entire Osun Police Command commiserate with the family and friends of Ayomide Taiwo on the death of their loved one as we promised to ensure justice is served,” she said. Popoola Adebayo, the deceased boss, confirmed that Ayomide remained unconscious since the attack.

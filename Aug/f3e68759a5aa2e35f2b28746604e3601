The acting Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos, Prof Omololu Soyombo has finally stepped down. This is coming after the Federal Government on Friday directed that the VC, who was appointed by the University Senate, resigns with immediate effect. However, Soyombo, in a statement on Saturday, said it was necessary he did so because the government had directed the UNILAG Senate to nominate an acting VC for the varsity. He said “The news of the setting up of a Special Visitation Panel to the University of Lagos by the Federal Government was received in the evening of Friday, 21st August 2020. “The government also directed the University Senate to nominate an Acting Vice-Chancellor for the University, for confirmation by the Governing Council. “With this, I am stepping down, with immediate effect, as Acting Vice-Chancellor of the University.” He also urged all staff and students of the institution to continue to go about their lawful activities peacefully.

Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, Kiddwaya, has apologised to fellow housemates over his boastful comments last night. Kidd had last night said he cannot be compared with any of the housemates in the reality TV show. Kidd is the son of a Benue billionaire, Terry Waya. He made the statement while talking to his lover, Erica. He also made a similar comment while addressing the whole house, telling them that he will remain in the house as the Head of House for next week, while some of them will be evicted on Sunday. His boastful attitude had angered his fellow housemates, most notably Ozo and Wathoni. Kiddwaya had told Erica, “I don’t take things seriously in this house; if I did, I would have had issues with some housemates. “I know what I have outside; my net worth cannot be compared with them outside here. “Nobody compares. They don’t compare to me, not like am bragging or something but, my NET-WORTH, my bank account don’t compare to them.” But he apologised on Wednesday morning, saying his comments were “quite insensitive but wasn’t an attack on anybody.” #Kiddwaya apologises to fellow housemates over insensitive, boastful comments #BBNaijia #bbnaijialockdown #kiddrica pic.twitter.com/NLoWDT44lH — Nwachukwu John Owen (@johnowen99) August 19, 2020

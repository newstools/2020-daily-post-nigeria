The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has insisted that some people were scheming to get the Edo State governorship postponed. PDP insisted that voters will not be deterred by claims of insecurity aimed at scaring them. The ruling stated that Edo people were ready for the September 19 poll. State Publicity Secretary, Chris Nehikhare, spoke on Sunday in Benin. “Edo people are wiser now and will come out to vote the party and re-elect Gov Godwin Obaseki back to Osadebey Avenue,” NAN quoted him as saying. The spokesman declared that those jittery were “going about trying to create fear in the minds of the electorate by raising false alarm and unfounded allegations. “Security agencies in the state must broaden their intelligence gathering and improve their security machinery”, he said. Nehikhare hailed the reception so far accorded PDP by the party supporters in Edo South Senatorial District.

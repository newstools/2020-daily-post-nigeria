Big Brother Naija ‘lockdown’ housemate Vee has said she was shocked and heartbroken to see Neo among the bottom four housemates on Sunday. Neo, Kaisha, Trikytee and Wathoni were the least voted housemates by the public last week. This had Neo in a tight position and almost evicted. However, Neo was saved while Kaisha was evicted from the reality show. Reacting to Sunday night’s eviction, Vee during her diary session on Monday told Big Brother that Neo has been heartbroken since the eviction show. According to her, he was surprised that fans were not voting for him and that has made him question his decisions in the house. Vee said: “I was heartbroken that Neo was among the final four “I know even though he stayed it has affected him emotionally. He is heartbroken. “I was shocked and other housemates were too, to see Neo in the bottom four. “It just made us realize that it could be anyone and I’m grateful it wasn’t me. I would have been very surprised if Neo left because he’s not a weak housemate.”

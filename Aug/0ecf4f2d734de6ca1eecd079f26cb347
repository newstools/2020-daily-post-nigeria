Aisha Umaru, Big Brother Naija Lockdown housemate, has been evicted from the 2020 edition. Four housemates; TrickyTee, Kaisha, Wathony and Neo scored the least votes from fans this week. As has been the seasonâ€™s style, housemates were called to decide who would be evicted out of the four housemates with the lowest votes. At the end of votes, Kaisha got the highest nomination from housemates. This leaves 15 housemates to battle for N85m in the next seven weeks.

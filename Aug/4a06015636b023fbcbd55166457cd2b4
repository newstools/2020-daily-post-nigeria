Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo met Governors Abubakar Badaru of Jigawa and Simon Lalong of Plateau State at the presidential villa. The trio met on reconciliation efforts of the All Progressives Congress (APC) chapters in Imo, Ogun and Oyo States. There have been crises among warring factions in recent months. Badaru told the media that the VP gave some suggestions on how to do the job well. He explained that the peace moves were to make sure that the party is strong. “If there are ripples among members, we’ll bring them together and make sure we have one strong and powerful party.” Badaru disclosed that they also discussed the zero oil committee. “We are charting our progress and a new agenda for the development of non-oil exports”, the governor added. Lalong spoke in the same vein, adding that Osinbajo was interested in reconciliation within the APC. “He is also from Ogun State; you cannot do reconciliation without consulting him. He knows everybody there, he knows part of the problems. So, he can give us advice as to how to go about it,” he said.

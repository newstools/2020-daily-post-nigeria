A former Governor of defunct Gongola State, Amb Wilberforce Juta, is dead. “The roll is called up yonder! The Noble Baba Juta has gone to be with the Lord,” a friend of the bereaved family, Chief Timaus Mathias, said on his Facebook page. Wilberforce Juta, who was deputy governor of Gongola State from 1979, became governor early in 1983 when his principal, Abubakar Barde, resigned from office. Juta remained governor till October 1983 when his successor, Alhaji Bamangar Tukur, was elected. In a message confirming Wilberforce Juta’s passing on, the Adamawa State Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, said it was a shocking development. He declared three days for the state to mourn him. Fintiri said in a statement by his Press Secretary, Humwashi Wonosikou, that Juta was an epitome of humanness and service. Fintiri added that Wilberforce Juta, who was Nigeria’s ambassador to Zimbabwe from 2000 to 2004 and a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) until his death on Saturday, would be missed greatly by the PDP and Adamawa State. “Adamawa felt his impact in various sectors, especially in education and politics,” Fintiri said. As a mark of honour to the late Wilberforce Juta, Fintiri declared the three-day mourning period effective from Saturday July 15.

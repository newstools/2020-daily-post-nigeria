The Big Brother Naija, BBNaija house on Friday night got tensed after the housemates played charades and had some drinks. The tension started after Wathoni and Erica had a face-off over Kiddwaya. The drama started when Erica mentioned she does not like to chase guys. But, Wathoni indirectly disagreed, saying Kiddwaya who’s Erica’s love interest did not chase any girl in the house. Erica, got angry, broke down in tears after Kiddwaya failed to defend her. Later, consoling Erica, Kiddwaya assured her that he has her back and told her to ignore Wathoni. He encouraged Erica to cheer up and don’t make Wathoni cause issues in their relationship. Kiddwaya said: “Ignore Wathoni, she wants to see us apart, don’t let that happen. “Don’t let her win by seeing us have issues, to them they think like there’s an issue but we cannot let them have that. “I will always have your back from the bottom of my heart no matter what I say about certain topics. “Wipe your tears and don’t let them see you like this.” #kiddrica ship must sail, Wathoni cannot put asunder #erica#bbnaija pic.twitter.com/WR5FwEAUef — Olowo.

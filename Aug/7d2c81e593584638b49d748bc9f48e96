The All Progressives Congress (APC) has declared that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is not prepared for the forthcoming Edo and Ondo State governorship elections. APC says the PDP has resorted to spinning conspiracies about planned postponement of the elections. Yekini Nabena, the Deputy National Publicity Secretary, said this in a statement on Thursday. He stressed that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is in charge of polls and that the APC cannot speak on rescheduling or otherwise. Nabena noted that it was PDP’s practice to interfere in INEC operations and that the APC has not copied “such undemocratic and ignoble practice”. “If the elections are held today, we are ready and confident of victory based on our visible pro-people and development track records and progressive plans for the good people of Edo and Ondo states. “Our worry is the PDP’s threat of violence in the lead-up to the Edo and Ondo governorship elections as echoed by the recent Amnesty International report and other well-meaning concerns. As always, the PDP has absolutely nothing to campaign on and has resorted to spreading fear. “We will continue to reiterate that no life is worth the inordinate ambition of any partisan. The forthcoming elections must be peaceful, free, fair and credible. Votes must count and the wish of the electorate must prevail on who governs them. “We call on our state institutions particularly INEC, the Judiciary and our security services not to be distracted by the PDP’s usual manipulative and disruptive antics and concentrate on protecting our hard fought and cherished democracy”, Nabena added.

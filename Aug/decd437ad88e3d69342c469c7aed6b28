Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Trikytee has lamented being up for eviction twice in a row. Trikytee in the past two weeks has been up for possible eviction as he appeared among the bottom four housemates. However, he has been saved twice by housemates following the new voting process. But speaking during his diary session with Biggie, Trikytee complained that standing up for two weeks has affected his state of mind. According to him, he is disorganized and mentally unstable at the moment. “I don’t know how to feel it is draining to be up for eviction for two Sundays. “I’m mentally unstable, I’ve been up for two weeks non stop,” he said.

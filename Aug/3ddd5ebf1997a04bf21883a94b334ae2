Real Madrid left-back, Sergio Reguilon, is in talks to join Chelsea, according to ESPN. It is understood discussions are already at an advanced stage. Reguilon was voted “the best left-back in LaLiga” for the 2019/2020 season. Last week, Everton submitted £18m offer for the Real Madrid academy product, who shone while on loan at Sevilla. However, Chelsea have stepped in and are ready to hijack the move. The Blues’ interest may cast doubt over their pursuit of Leicester City’s left-back, Ben Chilwell. The two Premier League clubs have failed to reach a deal, with the Foxes valuing Chilwell at around £80m.

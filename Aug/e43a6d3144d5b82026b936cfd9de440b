Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Kiddwaya has cleared the air on having sex with Erica. Biggie on his return to the house played video clips to housemates showing how they disobeyed the house rules. In one of the clips, Erica and Kiddwaya were seen making movement under the duvet, with tissue paper beside the bed. This got the housemates screaming and Lucy especially, asked what was happening under the duvet that night. Kiddwaya making clarification in a conversation with Brighto and Trikytee on Monday morning, said what they did under the duvet cannot be tagged as a sex tape. According to him, housemates and viewers could only see movement under the duvet and cannot be certain about what happened. Kiddwaya added that having a sex tape with Erica would be done in the open without the duvet. “What we had under the duvet was not a sex tape. A sex tape would show both of us naked with no duvet. “You can only see movements but don’t know what is happening under the duvet. I‘m a nasty motherf**ker, I know my ways around girls, that’s why they love me,” Kiddwaya said. Meanwhile, Kiddwaya has been barred from participating in the Head of House task for the next three weeks for flouting house rules.

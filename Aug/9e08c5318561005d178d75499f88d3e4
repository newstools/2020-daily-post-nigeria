Bayer Leverkusen have told Chelsea they have to complete a deal for Kai Havertz by August 28. Havertz is keen to join the Blues, but both clubs have failed to agree a fee. Bayer are demanding for £90million, while Chelsea are willing to pay £70million. Leverkusen’s players will report for preseason next Friday and want Havertz future to be sorted out by then. The Bundesliga side saw their season ended after a 2-1 defeat to Inter Milan in the Europa League quarter-final and are now set for fresh talks with Havertz. The club’s CEO Fernando Carro said last week: “It was always clear that we will have talks once the Europa League season concluded. “Kai has voiced his desire to make the next step. At the moment, I can’t say whether this will work out in the near future or not.”

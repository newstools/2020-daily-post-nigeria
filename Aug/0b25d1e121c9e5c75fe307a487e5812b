Paris Saint-Germain have qualified for the Champions League semi-final. The Ligue 1 champions produced a stunning comeback against Atalanta to win 2-1 on Wednesday night. Pasalic’s first half goal seemed to be the winner with three minutes left. However, the introduction of fit-again Kylian Mbappe, turned the game around for PSG. Marqinhos bundled home the equalizer with one minute left on the clock, before Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting tucked away the winner from Mbappe’s cross deep into stoppage time. PSG will now face the winner of the RB Leipzig/Atletico Madrid tie for a place in the final.

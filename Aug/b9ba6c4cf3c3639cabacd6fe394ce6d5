Former Premier League and La Liga striker, Michael Owen, has predicted tonight’s Europa League semi-final tie between Manchester United and Sevilla at the RheinEnergieStadion in Germany. Man United defeated Copenhagen 1-0 in the Europa League last-8 final encounter a few days ago, while Sevilla won 1-0 against Wolves. But Owen expects Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side to qualify for the Europa League final by beating Sevilla 1-0. “Two former winners of the Europa League come face to face in the first of the semi-finals,” Owen wrote in his column for BetVictor. “The teams have only been paired together once before in UEFA competitions, and that was back in 2018 when Sevilla triumphed 2-1 on aggregate. “This time the result will be decided in a one-off tie. “This is definitely a clash of two teams who are extremely difficult to beat. Sevilla are unbeaten in 19 matches in all competitions, and Man United have lost just once in their last 24. “Both teams squeaked through their quarter-final ties with 1-0 wins. “Sevilla have now kept a clean sheet in their last 3 games, and I do not see many goals in this match. “I think Man United’s superior firepower might just be the difference between the sides and I am going for a 1-0 win for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men.” The match is scheduled at 8 pm.

Kiddwaya’s Mum sending Her love & appreciation. The love of a mother is overwhelming & it’s evident that she as well as all of us are really proud of Him. To see Her cry broke my heart but it’s consoling that it’s for a good cause❤️#VOTEKiddwaya #BBNaija #Kiddrica pic.twitter.com/i30AFhgaAX — Fyne (@Meechee_Jo) August 25, 2020

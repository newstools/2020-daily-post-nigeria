The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) says it has lifted the ban placed on some processes on its platforms to accommodate more requests from candidates who took the UTME prior to 2020. The Public Relations Officer of the exam board, Dr Fabian Benjamin disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen. He said the lift on the suspension, covering students who wrote the exam in previous years is to ensure that those who require corrections are able to do it. He explained that the move was necessitated by the need to prevent overcrowding at its Computer-Based Test Centres and other partner facilities, in line with extant COVID -19 protocols issued by relevant agencies. ‘‘However, it is to be noted that most of these operations are only available at JAMB offices nationwide. Furthermore, as the Board is desirous of sustaining compliance with COVID-19 protocols, it maintains that 2020 UTME candidates desirous of these services will only be attended to through the Appointment Booking Platform The exam body advised students requesting for admission letters, inter-university transfers, condonement of illegitimate admissions and other processes for previous years would be restored from Monday, 31st August, 2020. JAMB also urged all State offices to ensure that all clients comply with all existing COVID -19 protocols.

The Centre for Democracy and Development (CDD) has asked the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to intensify voters’ education ahead of the October 10, 2020, Ondo Governorship election. The centre maintains that voter education is key to getting the election process right in a democracy. The CSO made the call at a roundtable meeting organised for Civil Society Organisations in Ondo State on Thursday, ahead of the elections. Highlighting challenges witnessed in the just concluded Local Government election which are capable of undermining the credibility of the governorship poll, Describing the level of voters’ apathy in the state as the bane of the electoral process, the CSO said the challenges witnessed in the just concluded Local Government election are capable of undermining the credibility of the governorship poll, A communiqué signed by Idayat Hassan, the Director of the centre observed that the high level of violence during the LGA election has created a tense environment ahead of the governorship poll. “Every participant, stakeholders and political actors came to the poll with different agenda and this majorly led to the spike in violence,” the communiqué said. “There is a growing fear of stockpiling of arms ahead of the election, there have been cases of rival partisan camps openly displaying arms or engaging in exchange of gunfire just to show that they also have access to firearms – a means of pressing opponents. Most times they do this in the presence of Police officers who serve as aides to the political actors,” the communique added. Making its recommendations, the CSOs called on INEC to conduct a comprehensive security risk assessment to identify areas with high risks of security challenges, intensify voters’ education to reduce voter apathy, ensure that all sensitive and insensitive materials arrive the polling unit on time and sensitize its own staff while ridding the commission of the bad eggs.

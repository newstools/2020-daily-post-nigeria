The Nigerian military has eliminated several Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) terrorists. The Air Task Force of Operation LAFIYA DOLE knocked a camp at Tongule in the Lake Chad area. Coordinator, Defence Media Operations, Maj.-Gen. John Enenche announced this in a statement on Friday. The spokesman said the air raid was in continuation of the offensive against terrorist elements in the North East. He disclosed that the airstrikes followed intelligence indicating insurgents’ terrorists’ activities in the village. Enenche said Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jets attacked the location after confirmatory intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions. The mission showed the presence of a sizable number of the ISWAP elements at designated locations, the General noted. “The NAF jets took turns in engaging the location, scoring devastating hits on the designated targets and leading to the destruction of the structures as well as the neutralisation of several ISWAP fighters,” he added.

Sevilla coach, Julen Lopetegui, has paid tribute to Manchester United ahead of both side’s Europa League semi-final clash on Sunday night at the RheinEnergieStadion in Cologne, Germany. Lopetegui said the current Red Devils squad Sevilla will face in the Europa League last-4 tonight, is the best Man United line-up for a long time. According to him, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men are much better now, adding that they have found the space for the many quality players that they have. Sevilla head into the game after eliminating Wolves from the Europa League last-8 in their previous encounter, while Man United knocked out Copenhagen from the competition. The winner between Sevilla and Man United will play against either Shakhtar Donetsk or Inter Milan, who square off on Monday, in the Europa League final. “This United is the best Manchester United in recent years, a team that has found its way, that is why they have not lost in the Premier League since January,” Lopetegui told reporters at his pre-match press conference as quoted by Goal. “They have found the space for the many quality footballers that they have. They are complete. They’ll force us to play a great game to compete with them. He added: “This is what I hope for on Sunday night, a semi-final in a game of maximum difficulty and that will require us at all levels to play collectively. “We like to play beautiful and important matches. For that, we have fought and worked all year. It’s an important game against a great opponent. “We’ll be able to arrive prepared. We’ll try to overcome them, no matter how big a team they are.”

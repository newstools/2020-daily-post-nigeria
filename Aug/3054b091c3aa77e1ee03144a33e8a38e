Gabriel Magalhães completed his Arsenal medical in London today, according to The Athletic. The Brazil defender flew into the UK on Monday, to complete the final details on his £27million move to the Emirates. Magalhaes will now put pen to paper on a five-year contract with the Gunners. However, the 22-year-old will have to be in a 14-day quarantine, before meeting his new team-mates. There has recently been a spike in COVID-19 cases across France, meaning it is now on Britain’s quarantine list. Magalhaes will be unavailable for selection when Arsenal face Liverpool this weekend in the Community Shield. Arsenal won the race for Magalhaes, who was also chased by Napoli and Manchester United, in a big boost for Mikel Arteta’s rebuilding project at the Emirates.

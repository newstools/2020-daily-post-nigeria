The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, on Saturday pointed reasons Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, is “bitter” with the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. PDP alleged that Tinubu and some APC “cabals” are bitter with Obaseki because he refused them access to the state’s treasury. The party stated this in a series of tweets on its verified Twitter handle. It also charged the former Lagos State governor to stop “whining” over his failure to allegedly take over the Edo State House of Assembly.” The tweet titled: “PDP expose why Tinubu is bitter with Obaseki,” reads: “The @OfficialPDPNig National Campaign Council for Edo state governorship election counsels the former Governor of Lagos state, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, to stop whining over the failure of the coup against the Edo state House of Assembly by the @OfficialAPCNg “The @OfficialPDPNig Campaign said the whining by Asiwaju Tinubu has further validated allegations that the horrendous attempt to seize the Edo legislature has the fingers of the @OfficialAPCNg leadership for their personal reasons. “Our Campaign notes that Asiwaju’s position also confirms allegations that some people in the @OfficialAPCNg are bitter with @GovernorObaseki because he (Obaseki) refused to allow the @OfficialAPCNg cabal to have access to Edo treasury as well as his refusal to foist illegal levies and taxes on the people.” Recall that Tinubu had said Obaseki would be defeated during the September 19 governorship election in Edo State. The APC National Leader said Obaseki will be voted out due to his woeful failure as governor.

Social media celebrity, Ismaila Mustapha, popularly called Mompha, on Tuesday, filed a suit seeking to compel the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to pay him N5 million as damages for alleged unlawful re-arrest and detention. DAILY POST had reported that Mustapha, who is facing a N32 billion fraud charge, was re-arrested on Friday, (Aug.14) by the EFCC. He was re-arrested when he went to the EFCC Office, Ikoyi, Lagos, to reclaim his belongings which were seized from him by the anti-graft agency in 2019. Following the development, Mompha in the suit filed on his behalf on Tuesday by his counsel, Mr. Gboyega Oyewole (SAN), Mustapha has begged the court to declare that his re-arrest and detention by the EFCC was unjustifiable and unlawful. He urged the court to declare that the continued seizure of the items violated his right to own property under Section 44 of the constitution. He prayed that the court order the EFCC not only to free him but also to give him back the seized items and pay him N5 million as damages. However, the spokesman for the EFCC, Mr. Dele Oyewale, said that Mustapha’s re-arrest was connected to a fresh set of cyber fraud charges. NAN reports that the court has yet to fix a date to hear Mustapha’s N5 million suit.

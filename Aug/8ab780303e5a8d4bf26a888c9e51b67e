Three persons trapped in a building after a truck crashed into it at Madala, FCT, have been rescued. The Director-General, FCT Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, Idriss Abbas in a statement on Sunday explained that the truck, which was loaded with beverages, crashed into the residential building on Saturday. Abbas said that the victims sustained injuries and had been taken to the Zuba General Hospital. He said the accident caused a gridlock on the Zuba-Abuja expressway, forcing motorists to seek alternative routes to reach Abuja. “The rains are getting heavier and the roads are getting slippery; motorists must apply more caution,” he warned. He also urged developers to always follow approved building plans and desist from manipulating the plans to suit their personal interest, thereby endangering lives. “We have observed that some of the houses affected by the flood are structures whose owners try to extend the fence to the banks of the rivers close to them, just to add a few meters to their originally approved plot,” he added. Abbas stressed the need for all hands to be on deck to complement efforts of the FCT administration toward reducing disasters to the barest minimum. He also advised residents to always call the toll-free emergency number, 112 for the prompt response to any emergency, NAN reports.

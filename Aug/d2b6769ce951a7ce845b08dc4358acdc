Former Holland striker, Robin van Persie, has predicted that Manchester United will edge a five-goal thrilled against Sevilla, when both sides face each other in the Europa League semi-final on Sunday. United book their place in the final four, thanks to a narrow 1-0 win over FC Copenhagen, while Sevilla knocked out Wolves. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men are now two games away from winning a major trophy, for the first time since the 2016/2017 campaign. Speaking to UEFA ahead of the game, Van Persie said: “Sevilla are playing so well – so silky, technical. “Manchester United: they’re in a very good shape now. They look fit, they look strong, they look ready. “I would go for Manchester United, but Sevilla are a very, very good team, so a very close one. Man United 3-2 Sevilla,” Van Persie said.

Barcelona’s president, Josep Bartomeu, has admitted that the club tried to re-sign Neymar last summer. However, Bartomeu admits it might be impossible to bring the Brazilian back from Paris Saint-Germain this year. Neymar left the Camp Nou in a stunning £198 million move to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017, but has consistently been linked with a return. The 28-year-old has won three Ligue 1 titles during his time in France and is set to play in the Champions League final for the club on Sunday, while Barca have failed to reach a final since his departure. Reports in Spain last week suggested Barca could reignite their attempts to re-sign Neymar, but Bartomeu is not optimistic. “Going for a player when the club he is in doesn’t want to sell him is impossible, Bartomeu told Barca TV. “Last summer we tried. He is a player who, with the pandemic situation, his club does not put him in the market. “It is normal. The big clubs want great players,” he said.

The Sultan of Sokoto, Saad Abubakar has paid a private visit to the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai. The Sultan, upon his arrival at the Government House, held a closed-door meeting with Governor El-Rufai. Also in the meeting were some government officials including the Senator representing Kaduna North in the National Assembly, Suleiman Abdu-Kwari. The Sultan’s visit comes barely 24 hours after Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, the former Emir of Kano, visited the Governor to discuss issues bothering on security. El-Rufai disclosed that the meeting with the Sultan was to discuss the security challenges in Southern Kaduna and other parts of the state. He said he received advice and encouragement from the Sultan towards finding a lasting solution to the security challenges in the state. The Governor said he “appreciates the Sultan for his fatherly visit and support in ensuring that peace returns to the state.” Communities in Southern Kaduna have recently witnessed a surge in violent attacks by bandits, leaving several people dead and properties destroyed.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, Laycon, on Friday told Wathoni the dream he had about Erica. The BBNaija housemate said this while lamenting about Erica’s attitude making him emotionally unsettled. Laycon had earlier told Vee and Neo that he was tired of Erica intentionally touching Kiddwaya in front of him. Speaking with Wathoni, Laycon said he dreamt he kissed Erica in his dreams. “I dreamt I kissed Erica in reality. You know I refused to kiss her that Saturday night she was drunk.” Wathoni told Laycon he had been thinking of the female housemate and that may be the reason he had the dream. Laycon added that he is an emotional person, which is why he discusses his emotions and feelings with close housemates and finds it hard to move on.

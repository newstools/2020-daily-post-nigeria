Kiddwaya, Big Brother Naija, BBNaija housemate, has said his billionaire father, Terry Waya, took fourteen Nigerian governors to London for his birthday. Kiddwaya said the act by his father in 2001 caught the attention of the then president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo. The BBNaija housemate said this on Thursday while speaking to the other housemates during his Thursday wager task. Kiddwaya said: “My dad took 14 governors during Obasanjo’s tenure for his birthday to London and that caused a problem. “However, he did not care and does things for himself because he loves to organize events and connect people. “I’m who I am because of him and my story is not a pity one but I’m grateful to him. “Throughout his time, he has made people senators and governors.”

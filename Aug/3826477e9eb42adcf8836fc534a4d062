An unknown number of members of the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra (IPOB) are feared killed in Enugu. On Sunday, the Biafra agitators clashed with security operatives. The clash occurred in the Emene area. Policemen had stormed Community Secondary School, Emene where members of IPOB were meeting. But the attempt to arrest the IPOB members was resisted leading to a face-off. When it appeared that the police officers were being overpowered, teams of Police, Army and Department of State Service (DSS) operatives arrived. Several gunshots were reportedly fired leading to casualties.

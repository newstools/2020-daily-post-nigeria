A former Arsenal player, Paul Merson, has backed the club to beat Liverpool in today’s Community Shield tie at the Wembley Stadium. Arsenal head to the game after defeating MK Dons 4-1 in a pre-season friendly game on Tuesday, while Liverpool played a 2-2 draw with Red Bull. Merson believes Mikel Arteta’s men can defeat the Premier League champions because the Gunners are a “cup team”. “The Community Shield is a benchmark for Arsenal to see how far behind Liverpool they still are,” Merson told Starsport. “They could beat Liverpool and win the game. Of course, they could. But that’s what Arsenal are a cup team. “On their day they can beat anybody. But how often is their day? Over 38 games it is Liverpool who are consistent. That is what Arsenal need to find. Consistency. “That’s why this game is a benchmark for them. They need to see how far behind they are.” The kick-off time for the game is 4:30 pm.

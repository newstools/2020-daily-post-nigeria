Chelsea winger, Willian, is ‘upset and offended’ by the way his career with the club has ended, the UK Sun reports. Willian has spent seven years with the Blues and has achieved success under different managers. However, with his current contract set to expire, the 31-year-old was hopeful that his loyalty will be rewarded with a fresh three-year deal. But Chelsea have been unwilling to cave into Willian’s demands. Manager Frank Lampard tried to make a case for the Brazilian, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Willian, who is set to join London rivals Arsenal, might have now played his last game for the Stamford Bridge outfit. He missed the FA Cup final against the Gunners with an Achilles problem and will not feature in their Champions League last-16 second leg match at Bayern Munich.

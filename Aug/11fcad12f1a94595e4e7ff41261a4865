Stakeholders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ekiti South West Council area of Ekiti State have blamed the National Chairman of the party, Prince Uche Secondus, for the crisis in the chapter. The party stakeholders said that Secondus was fueling the lingering crisis by fanning embers of discord among party leaders. This was contained in a communiqué by the party leaders after a meeting in Ilawe-Ekiti on Sunday. In the communiqué signed by former Ekiti PDP Publicity Secretary, Elder Kunle Oguntoye and Hon. Tolu Dada on behalf of party leaders in Ekiti Southwest, the leaders alleged that Secondus was acting the script of ex-governor of Ekiti State, Ayodele Fayose. They accused Fayose of being desperate to seize control of the party’s structure. The party leaders and stakeholders warned the party’s National Chairman to desist from his plan to conduct local and state congress in the state, according to them, acting contrary would not only damage the party but deal a devastating blow to PDP in the future. The communique added, “We have only come to send this signal to the National Working Committee. Prince Uche Secundus is obviously toying with the intelligence of Ekiti people. His unholy romance with Fayose will only land him in trouble. “We learnt with dismay the plans of the NWC to sneak into Ekiti to conduct LG and State Congresses. “We are saying without fear or favour that any attempt to do so will amount to flagrant violation of the rule of law considering the fact that the one earlier purportedly conducted by the Deputy Governor of Taraba State, Engr. Aruna Manu is still before the Appellate court for determination. “Therefore, anyone who accepts to be assigned to Ekiti under any guise of conducting Congress will be doing so at his or her own peril as Ekiti people will use all legal powers within reach to prevent imposition of unwanted candidates.”

Former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, has paid tribute to former Military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, as he clocked 79 years. Abubakar in a statement issued by his Media Adviser, Mr Paul Ibe, on Sunday in Abuja, said that Babangida’s intelligence, wisdom, charisma, understanding and respect for Nigeria’s diversity stood the test of time. “Babangida is amazingly gifted. He is a strategic thinker and a true believer in national unity and national integration, qualities for which history and posterity will deliver a favourable verdict on him. “One of the reasons Babangida (IBB) charms arouses the interest of the world is his unique capacity to learn and listen to others, even if he disagrees with them,” he said. Abubakar said apart from being decisive and bold in taking major decisions at the right time. Every sincere Nigerian would commend Babangida for his broadmindedness, which reflected in the structure of his government. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate in the 2019 election recalled Babangida’s women emancipation agenda, which was powered by his late wife, Mariam. While wishing Babangida more years in good health, Abubakar appealed to Nigerian politicians to emulate his philosophy of inclusive government, which according to him, is a prerequisite for reducing tension and separatist tendencies in the country.

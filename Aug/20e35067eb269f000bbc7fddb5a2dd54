The forthcoming elections in Edo and Ondo States have been linked to the 2023 presidency. Leader of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, said the next presidential poll was the main factor. A statement he issued on Sunday called on the international community to focus their attention on the governorship elections. The pastor revealed that some politicians vying for the 2023 presidential election had concluded plans to take the two states by force. He said,” Why do you want to use force to get what does not belong to you? Some forces outside Ondo and Edo states want to take the states by force. We must pray against bloodshed. “Those vying for the 2023 election want to use Ondo, Edo states to test their popularity. You all know that any party that wins the two states will get more votes for a presidential candidate of their party.” Giwa described the just concluded local council election in Ondo as disappointing. “Could you imagine that police was even following them around to snatch ballot boxes? Just ordinary local council election, this is ridiculous,” he added.

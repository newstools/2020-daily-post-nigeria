Arsenal have clinched their second trophy of this month, as they beat Liverpool on penalties to lift the Community Shield on Saturday. The Gunners, who won their record-extending FA Cup earlier in August, took the lead in the first half through Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Aubameyang received a diagonal pass from Bukayo Saka and unleashed a rasping drive past Alisson Becker. Mikel Arteta’s men had more chances to double their lead before the break and wasted them. However, it was Liverpool that got the next goal, with substitute Takumi Minamino slotting home after a mix-up in Arsenal’s defence. The game went straight to penalties and Ryan Brewster missed, before Aubameyang netted the winning kick.

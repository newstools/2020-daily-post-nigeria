A former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi, has condemned the disinvitation of Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State by the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA. Governor El-Rufai’s invitation to speak as one of the guest speakers at the 2020 conference of the NBA was withdrawn by the body of lawyers late last week. Sanusi spoke during a visit to the Kaduna State Governor at his office in the Government House on Sunday. According to the former monarch, it is wrong to withdraw the invitation to the without given the Governor a fair hearing to defend himself. He urged parties involved in the matter to handle it properly to prevent it from generating ethnic or religious concerns. Sanusi said, “The association has lost an opportunity to interrogate the governor and collectively rub minds to identify areas that need to be addressed for the purpose of governance.” Furthermore, Sanusi prayed for peace to return to the troubled region in Kaduna and other parts of the country where there were security challenges. He also commended his long term friend, El-Rufai for the way he has managed the affairs of Kaduna.

Big Brother Naija, BBNaija ‘Lockdown’ housemate, Lucy has said she would love to exit the reality show. Lucy, who was the previous head of house, made this known to Dorathy. According to her, she is fed up with housemates not taking her suggestions during a task and selecting their favourites Lucy said: “I’ll rather not be here than cause so many things in Biggie’s house. “Let me just leave before I cause problems. “I would learn from outside I don’t want to be seeing some certain things.” Dorathy, however, advised Lucy to stay, learn from housemates and stop being too emotional.

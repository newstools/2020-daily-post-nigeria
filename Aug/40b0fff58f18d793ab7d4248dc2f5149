A former Premier League star, Charlie Nicholas, has predicted the winner of Sunday’s Champions League final between Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich. PSG will tackle Bayern in the Champions League final at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal. The French Ligue 1 champions head to the game after eliminating RB Leipzig in the Champions League semi-final a few days ago, while the Bundesliga champions knocked out Lyon. Providing his prediction, Nicholas told Sky Sports: “It was the right draw for PSG, so it could be their time. “There is too much talent on show, and I do love Neymar. “Lionel Messi is the superstar of football, but football has caught up with Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo by nature, and they’ll go into slumps. “Neymar can win his second Champions League trophy. “Serge Gnabry looks unreal, and Bayern Munich looks strong. It has been a massive effort from both of these sides, and it’s a treat to have them in the final. “The wine list is already prepared for this final, it looks breathtaking, and I see goals again here. “It has to be the defence for Bayern Munich which will be their undoing. “PSG will be the kings of Europe.”

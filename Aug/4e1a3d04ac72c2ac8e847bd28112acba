FC Copenhagen midfielder, Jose Zeca, on Monday night, thanked Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, for the work done at the Red Devils so far after his side’s Europa League 1-0 defeat. Copenhagen put up a good fight in their quarter-final clash, but it wasn’t enough, with Man United emerging victorious, thanks to a penalty from Bruno Fernandes. Recall that Solskjaer had already guided Man United to a third-place finish on the 2019/20 Premier League campaign and also secured qualification for next season’s Champions League. The victory over Copenhagen means Man United are now in the semi-finals of the Europa League. Man United will now play the winner between Wolves vs Sevilla on Sunday. “Thank you very much for everything you have done in Manchester,” Zeca said to Solskjaer, exchanging a handshake with the Man United boss on the pitch. And Solskjaer responded by saying “we are trying to bring it back. Thanks to Fernandes, he is helping.” Watch video below: Copenhagen’s Zeca to Solskjaer: “Thank you very much for everything you’re doing with Manchester United.” Ole: “We’re trying to get it back.

The Police in Delta State have in custody a 46-year-old security guard who allegedly raped an eight-year-old girl. The incident occured in Ibusa community in Oshimili North Local Government Area on Monday, August 24, in an uncompleted building. Onome Onovwakpoyeya, Police Public Relations Officer, told journalists on Tuesday in Asaba that the suspect was exposed by neighbours. “The suspect was caught in the act by his neighbours after he lured the little girl into the building,” the spokesman said. NAN quoted a source as saying the suspect is a security guard at the building site which is close to the victim’s residence. “We learnt from the little girl that the suspect lured her into the building by lying that he would send her on an errand. When her parents did not see her, they alerted people. “A woman said she saw the little girl entering the uncompleted building. We rushed into the building and caught him defiling her. We found that he tied the hands of the girl before forcing his way into her body.” The source disclosed that the father of the victim, a Pastor, had opted to keep quiet so as to shield the girl from stigmatisation. “The father was not prepared to raise any alarm, but we were angry and arrested the suspect. We have taken him to the Ibusa Police Station.”

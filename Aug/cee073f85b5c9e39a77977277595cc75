Erica said: “I feel like I should still be able to be friends with Laycon. We were friends, It’s not as if something happened between us so why can’t we just remain friends. “I really miss the friendship we had and gisting with him, I don’t like losing friends. “I like the way Laycon’s mind works but now for some stupid reasons we cannot talk.”

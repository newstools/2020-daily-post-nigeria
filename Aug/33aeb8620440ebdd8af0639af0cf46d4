A yet-to-be-identified tanker driver moving a diesel-laden tanker within Lagos State, on Thursday, lost control of the loaded vehicle around New Road bus stop in Apapa area of the state. The tanker fell in the process, blocking the major road in the area. This was confirmed by the Director-General of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu. He explained that crash led to a temporary blockage of vehicular movement in the area before a heavy-duty equipment was used to recover the fallen tanker. “Distress calls were received concerning the incident and upon arrival, it was confirmed that a truck loaded with AGO had fallen due to suspected brake failure. “This resulted in the obstruction of free vehicular activities along the corridor. A multi-stakeholder team comprising the agency’s responders, LRU firefighters, Lagos State Fire Service, LASTMA, LSNC and the Nigerian Police worked together to evacuate the impediment off the road. “The agency’s heavy-duty equipment was used for recovery, while the area has been blanketed to prevent any secondary incident. Operation concluded with no loss of life or injury,” he said.

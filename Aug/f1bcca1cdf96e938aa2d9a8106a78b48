An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court on Wednesday ordered that a 19-year-old man, Ismaila Mustapha, be remanded in Kirikiri Correctional Centre, for raping his neighbour’s three daughters. The Prosecutor, ASP Bisi Ogunleye, while presenting the case urged that the matter be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for legal advice. Ogunleye told the court that Mustapha committed the offence sometime in March at his residence. He alleged that Mustapha defiled three sisters. According to him, the offence contravened the provisions of Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. However, Magistrate Ejiro Kubeinje, who rejected the plea of the accused, ordered that he be remanded in Kirikiri Correctional Centre and directed the prosecutor to duplicate the case file to the DPP for advice. Kubeinje adjourned the case until Sept. 9 for mention,” NAN reports.

Police in Anambra State have commenced investigation into the case of a woman, Mrs Calista Ojinnaka who allegedly committed suicide on 26th July by hanging self with a rope tied to a ceiling fan in her house in Onitsha. There have been doubt about the claims of the husband to the deceased, Mr. John Ojinnaka, that she had spiritual problem and may have hung herself to death. The spokesperson of the state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Haruna Mohammed who spoke with DAILY POST said the command has commenced a thorough invitation into the matter. Though he declined further comment, he simply said, “Yes, I can only tell you the case is under investigation to ascertain the actual cause of the incident please.” Meanwhile, a source who lives close to the deceased stated that the husband was the primary suspect and was still being detained, especially as he ran away from the house to report to the police, after some neighbours noted that Mrs Ojinnaka could not have committed suicide as her body was not dangling in the air, but was rather found kneeling down at the centre of the room, with a rope to her neck. The deceased had on the fateful day, Sunday 26th July, been found hanging on a loose rope tied to ceiling fan inside their apartment at No. 2, Uzodinma street, Fegge, Onitsha. The deceased’s husband, Mr. John Ojinnaka, told sympathizers, who thronged his house that he was shocked to find his wife dangling on a rope when he returned from shopping for what they will eat. He, however, blamed her action on a spiritual problem. “I woke up this morning in our two-room apartment, where I was with my wife and both of us discussed on how to buy things to eat. Already, my wife has some spiritual issues for some time now. So, I went to buy the things we would eat, and on coming back, the same morning, I went straight to the room and discovered the lifeless body of my wife hanging on a ceiling fan inside our room,” he had claimed.

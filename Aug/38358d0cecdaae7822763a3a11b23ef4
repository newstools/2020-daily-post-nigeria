The Federal Ministry of Education (FMoE) has reacted to the removal of the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, from office by the Governing Council of the institution. Spokesperson of the FMoE, Ben Goong, in a statement in Abuja, said they have not been briefed on the purported removal of Vice-Chance Goong said that the council has the power to hire and fire the Vice-Chancellor. The statement, however, said that due process must be followed in doing so. The statement read in part: “My dear colleagues, the Federal Ministry of Education wishes to state that it is yet to be briefed on the developments at the University of Lagos regarding the purported removal of the VC. “While the ministry awaits for the proper briefing from the university authorities, it is important to reaffirm that council has the power to hire and fire but that due process must be followed in doing so.” Meanwhile, some council members have opposed the sack of Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Lagos (UNILAG). The governing council is chaired by Wale Babalakin. Two members, who are UNILAG Senate representatives in the council accused the council chairman of persecuting Ogundipe.

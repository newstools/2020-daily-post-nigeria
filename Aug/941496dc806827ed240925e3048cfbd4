Big Brother Naija lockdown housemate, Prince, has expressed fear that housemates will vote him out if he finds himself among the four housemates with the least votes. Prince, during a conversation with his love interest, Tolanibaj said he prefers the previous nomination process where housemates only nominate people for eviction and viewers save their favorites. According to him, being among the bottom four should be avoided because even with a stronger fan base, one can be voted out before someone with a weaker fan base. He said, “I won’t be offended if I find out someone close to me nominated me for eviction. “I know some many people here will be glad if I leave because I am very competitive. I keep praying to God that I should not be at the housemates’ mercy.” Responding, Tolanibaj advised him to be himself and have fun because it is a game.

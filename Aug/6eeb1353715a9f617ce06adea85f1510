Madagascar has sacked its Minister of Health, Ahmad Ahmad as coronavirus spreads in the country.
This is coming a month after Ahmad had a problem with the President for seeking outside help for coronavirus. Madagascar saw COVID-19 cases rise in July despite an official campaign to promote a controversial herbal drink touted as a remedy for the virus. Minister Ahmad had written a letter to international agents asking for medical equipment after hospitals in the country raised concern about lack of beds. The move angered President Andry Rajoelina who said the Minister had acted “without consulting” either the government or head of state. His sack was announced on Thursday as President Rajoelina reshuffles his cabinet. “Jean Louis Hanitrala Rakotovao has been named new health minister,” cabinet secretary Valery Ramonjavelo told a press conference, without giving details about the change.

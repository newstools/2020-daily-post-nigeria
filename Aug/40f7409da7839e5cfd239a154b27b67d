The Union of European Football Association (UEFA) has said that the Champions League semi-finals will not feature either Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi or Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo for the first time since the 2004/2005 campaign. UEFA said this immediately after Bayern Munich eliminated Barcelona from the Champions League last-8 final on Friday night. In a tweet, UEFA wrote on its official Twitter handle: “The UCL semi-finals will not feature either Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo for the first time since 2004/05.” Recall that Barcelona were completely overpowered by a ruthless Bayern side, who scored four times in either halves as the match ended 8-2 in favour of the German club at the Estádio da Luz in Portugal. Goals from Thomas Muller (2), Ivan Perisic, Serge Gnabry, Joshua Kimmich, Robert Lewandowski and Phillippe Coutinho (2) ensured the Bundesliga champions qualified for the semi-finals where they will take on the winner between Manchester City and Lyon. Also, Lyon eliminated Juventus in the Champions League last-8 final last week on away goal rule after the match ended 2-2 aggregate, despite Ronaldo’s two goals in Turin. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-829018" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/uefa.jpg" alt="" width="585" height="434" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/uefa.jpg 585w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/uefa-300x223.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 585px) 100vw, 585px">

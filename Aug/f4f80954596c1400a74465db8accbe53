The Commissioner of Police in Enugu State, Mr Ahmad Abdurrahman, has disclosed that no policeman is missing in the state contrary to speculations about missing personnel. Abdurrahman said this in a statement issued by the Command’s Public Relations Officer, Mr Daniel Ndukwe on Sunday in Enugu. He urged residents to disregard the falsehood being peddled by mischief-makers. Abdurrahman also warned peddlers of such falsehood and rumour to “desist forthwith with their malicious intention.” He said such malicious, misleading and mendacious information was capable of affecting the peace enjoyed in the state and also causing tension. He said: “The attention of the Command has been drawn to the false, malicious and misleading information published on Aug. 27, by a blogger and replicated on social media, claiming that nine policemen went missing in the state. “To this end, the general public, particularly residents of the state, have been enjoined to totally disregard such falsehood being peddled by misguided and mischief-makers in its entirety. “Such an incident didn’t happen anywhere in the state; neither did the Command confirm nor issue any statement in that regard.” “Residents should promptly report any person(s) found and/or known to be peddling such fake and malicious information to the nearest police station or call the Command’s emergency hotlines.

The Federal Government on Monday said passengers who fail to comply with the COVID-19 protocol put in place as it prepares to open international flights would be suspended from travelling for six months. The Coordinator, Presidential Task Force on COVID-19, Dr. Sani Aliyu, said this at the daily briefing of the PTF on COVID-19 in Abuja on Monday. Aliyu said that there would be sanctions for non-compliance with the guidelines on the part of the airlines and the passengers. Recall that FG had announced September 5, 2020, as the resumption date for international flights. “There will definitely be sanctions if they do not comply. Sanctions to the airlines if they allow passengers without a Covid-19 PCR result to the board, they will be sanctioned on arrival in Nigeria,” Aliyu said. “For passengers that decline to do the test, at Day 7, we will still allow them after Day 14 to have a test done after which their details will be forwarded to Port Health, Immigration, and part of the security services. “It’s very likely we will put in place measures to enforce this by suspending travel up to six months or deny foreign travels altogether.”

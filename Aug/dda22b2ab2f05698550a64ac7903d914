Chris Azebamwan, the Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress, APC, in Edo State, has said that the party has no plan to impeach Governor Godwin Obaseki, describing such a move as a waste of time. According to Azebamwan, the APC will defeat Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and its candidate, Governor Obaseki squarely and fairly in the forthcoming governorship election. He said there was no reason for the party to be wasting its time trying to impeach Obaseki. “Moving to impeach Obaseki is a waste of time; he only has a few months to stay,” Azebamwan told Channels Television’s Sunday Politics. Philip Shaibu, the Edo State Deputy Governor had yesterday claimed that assassins are currently in the State to eliminate some prominent personalities . The APC spokesman said the claim by Shaibu “is uncalled for.” Speaking further, he said, “We are in touch with the people and have been able to sell our agenda to them. We are carrying out an issue-based campaign and have no interest in impeaching Obaseki. “We have nothing to gain by instigating crisis; we will bend over backwards to toe the path of peace.” Recall that on Thursday morning, the premises of Edo State House of Assembly, was besieged by officers of the Nigeria Police Force. It is believed that some members elected on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC) and loyal to the former party chairman, Adams Oshiomole, had perfected plans for sitting at the complex which is currently under renovation. The Convener of Pro-Democracy and Human Rights group, Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, claimed Oshiomhole was behind the incident and the ultimate aim was to impeach Governor Obaseki, with one month to the gubernatorial poll.

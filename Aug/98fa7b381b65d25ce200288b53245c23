Dillian Whyte has said he was “bossing” Alexander Povetkin, before the Russian knocked him out in the fifth round. Whyte is also keen to activate the rematch clause in their contract. The Brixton heavyweight appeared to be coasting to victory, after flooring Povetkin twice in the fourth round. But Povetkin landed a massive uppercut in the fifth round to knock him out cold. Whyte told promoter Eddie Hearn via Matchroom Boxing’s Instagram: “Can we get the rematch in December? “Okay cool. I’m good, I’m good, it’s one of them things where he just landed. I was bossing it. “It is what it is. Rematch, it’s all good. That’s what heavyweight boxing is about.”

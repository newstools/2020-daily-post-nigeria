Barcelona midfielder, Ivan Rakitić, is set to join Europa League champions, Sevilla, on a two-year contract with an option of a further year. Rakitić will earn €3m-a-season at Sevilla, a significant cut on his €8m-a-season deal at Barcelona, Goal reports. The Croatian international has been deemed surplus to requirements by Barcelona’s new coach, Ronald Koeman. He was among the four players Koeman wants Barca to sell this summer. The 32-year-old did not regularly feature for Barcelona last season as they lost the La Liga title to Real Madrid. Speaking about his future at Barcelona, Rakitić said last season that he would do everything possible to change his lack of game time at Camp Nou. Rakitic said: “I do not know what will come now. It is tough because I want to play and not just be part of the team. I will do everything possible to change my situation.”

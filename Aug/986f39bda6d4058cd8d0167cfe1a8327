It has been revealed that Barcelona will pay Liverpool €5m (£4.5m) if midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, wins this season’s Champions League with Bayern Munich, Mirror UK reports. Coutinho scored twice against his parent club, Barcelona, for Bayern on Friday night after coming from the bench in the German side’s Champions League quarter-final 8-2 thrashing of the Blaugrana at the Estádio da Luz in Portugal. Barcelona splashed the cash (€5m) on Coutinho in 2018 in an eye-watering deal worth around £142m, but the Brazilian international failed to impress at the Nou Camp and has spent this season on loan at Bayern. The deal to sign Coutinho from Liverpool included a number of potential add-on clauses, but incredibly they are player-specific rather than club-specific. One of those clauses was that Barca would pay Liverpool €5m if the 26-year-old won the Champions League in either the 2018-19 or 2019-20 season, but it does not specify that it had to be while playing for them. Bayern is now arguably the favourites to win the Champions League following their impressive display on Friday against Barcelona. The Bundesliga champions will now face the winners of Saturday’s Manchester City vs Lyon clash in the semi-final on Wednesday before a potential final on Sunday. Meanwhile, Coutinho has been strongly linked with a move to Premier League side Arsenal in the past few weeks.

An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday, ordered that a 50-year-old man, Paul Nnadi, and his friend be remanded in Kirikiri Correctional Centre, Lagos for allegedly raping his 15-year-old stepdaughter. The police charged Nnadi and his friend, Ayobamidele Olaiya with conspiracy and defilement. Chief Magistrate P.E. Nwaka, however, did not take their plea. Nwaka ordered the police to return the case file to the Lagos Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for legal advice. Consequently, Nwaka adjourned the case until Sept. 17 for mention. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Insp. Christopher John alleged that they committed the offence sometime in 2019 at No. 6, Ibitoye St., Ajegunle, Lagos, and were charged with rape at the court. John alleged that Nnadi, who is the victim’s stepfather and Olaiya, his friend, took turns on her, NAN reports. John said that the case was reported at an Ajegunle police station and the defendants were arrested. The prosecutor said that the offence contravened the provisions of Section 260 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, which prescribed up to life imprisonment on conviction.

The Peoples Democratic Party National Campaign Council in Edo State, Wednesday, mocked the All Progressives Congress, APC, candidate in the forthcoming governorship election, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, describing him as “a lone ranger.” The PDP claimed that Ize-Iyamu has been left to walk alone by leaders and chieftains of the APC. The PDP stated this in a statement signed by Kola Ologbondiyan, Secretary, Publicity Sub-Committee of the campaign council. The PDP went on to describe the APC flag-bearer as a political wanderer who has been hovering around without any form of support. “Ize-Iyamu has since been deserted by his party after the Edo State chairman of the APC, Anslem Ojezua, declared that the APC has no candidate and that such explains why he is not campaigning for Ize-Iyamu,” the campaign council said. The PDP claimed that Ize-Iyamu’s campaign does not have the participation of APC members in Edo State and is stuck with the former national chairman of the APC, Adams Oshiomhole, who also has no party, having been dismissed from the party in his ward. “This is why Ize-Iyamu’s rallies are attended only by hired campaigners brought for him by the “partyless” Oshiomhole, from Kogi, Imo and other states,” the PDP claimed. The PDP campaign, therefore, advised Ize-Iyamu campaign team to stop wasting their time following Oshiomhole, adding that the former governor is leading them to nowhere.

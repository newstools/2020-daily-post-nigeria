The Federal Government has said it would retain the original sharing formula for its Special Public Works, SPW, scheme. The Minister of State for Labour and Productivity, Festus Keyamo, disclosed this while dismissing claims of approving a 40 percent rise in the allocation of jobs to political officeholders. The SPW is a federal government scheme aimed at employing 774, 000 unskilled Nigerians who would receive N20, 000 monthly. By design, state governors, National Assembly members, Ministers and other interest groups would get 15 percent of the job slot. However, Keyamo said the interest of the public would be uppermost in the allocation of the jobs. Speaking with Nation, Keyamo said: “The report on the sharing formula must have been a misapprehension of the instructions I gave to them to implement. “I did not give any instruction on 40 per cent rise for them to implement. We are sticking to the original formula of 15 per cent concession to political officeholders. “There may be a few adjustments here and there depending on local circumstances.”

Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo has insisted his current focus is on serving Nigeria and not the presidential election in 2023. Lately, there have been talks about zoning and a possible power shift to the south. Osinbajo has been mentioned as a potential presidential candidate, along with former Governor of Lagos State, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. But responding to a question on the 2023 elections at the virtual conference of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) on Thursday, Osinbajo made it clear he was not thinking about that. “I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity to serve Nigeria and right now I am focused on doing just that. “There are issues to be tackled and that has my undivided attention,” he said.

Manchester United captain, Harry Maguire, has been told that he could beat jail by paying £90,000, according to the UK Mirror. Maguire left a Greek court yesterday wearing a face mask and to a warning he could spend three years in prison. The 27-year-old appeared in court in Syros over an altercation on neighbouring island Mykonos. He pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, as he was grilled by a local prosecutor for almost two hours. If he was convicted, Maguire could pay a daily sum to avoid being sent to jail, under a scheme to ease overcrowding in Greek jails. Over three years that could be £90,000, less than half of Maguire’s £190,000-a-week wages.

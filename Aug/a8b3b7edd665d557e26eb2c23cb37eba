President Muhammadu Buhari has appointed the Chairman, Channels TV, John Momoh, as acting chairman of the University of Lagos (UNILAG) Governing Council. He is the president of UNILAG Alumni Association. Momoh represents the body in the council. The veteran journalist replaces Wale Babalakin, who was removed over the institution’s leadership crisis. Momoh’s appointment was signed by the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Sonny Echono. The letter, FME/PS/606/C.I/III/129, told him to preside “in the absence of the substantive pro-chancellor/chairman of council who has had to recuse himself in line with the visitor’s directive.” “You are to also submit a report on the decision of the council to the visitor through the honourable minister of education immediately thereafter.” Meanwhile, the council met on Tuesday and confirmed the appointment of Prof. Folasade Ogunsola as the Acting Vice-Chancellor. The virtual meeting was chaired by Momoh. Ogunsola, 58, becomes the first female to attain the position since UNILAG was founded in 1962.

The Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) has raised the alarm about All Progressives Congress (APC) members’ list. Salihu Lukman, the Director-General, expressed concern in a statement on Sunday. He recalled that immediately after the merger exercise, the party started work towards establishing computerised membership data centre. Lukman suggested that management of the membership register was currently in dispute. “Take for instance, the argument that APC membership register is domiciled on the Cloud. Who uploads it to the Cloud with whose authority and who is managing it? “How was it generated in the first place? Are the members of the APC in the register that is said to exist on the Cloud, financial members? Who did they pay their membership dues to?” He warned recruitment drive would have a lot of implication in terms of the format that would be used to guarantee participation. The DG stressed that APC can only be progressive if it is able to encourage and promote competition within the platform

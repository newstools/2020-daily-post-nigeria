The Governor of Abia State, Okezie Ikpeazu, has directed the contractor handling construction of the Afor Ibeji end of the Aba-Old Umuahia Road to extend the work to Ubakala Junction. He gave the directive while inspecting the progress of work on the road as part of the Statewide project inspection and commissioning program tagged “Kinetic Abia.” He expressed satisfaction with the work already done by the contractor at Afor Ibeji end of the road using rigid pavement technology and urged him not to relent in maintaining the quality of the work.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833532" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598378742829.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598378742829.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598378742829-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> According to him, his government decided to embark on the Afor Ibeji road project to solve the perennial road failures along the axis for the past 20 years and directed that the project be extended to the Ubakala axis before he will commission the entire stretch. Ikpeazu said allowing that portion of the road to remain undone would paint a bad picture of the job already done by Arab Contractors at the Aba Road axis. The governor, who disclosed that two more road projects would be completed in Umuahia South LGA before the end of the year, thanked the people for their unflinching support to his administration over the years.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833530" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598378735867.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598378735867.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598378735867-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> Speaking earlier, the Secretary to the State Government, Barr Chris Ezem, and the Transition Committee Chairman, Umuahia South Local Government Area. Hon. Ndukwe Adindu, commended the Governor for his dexterity and managerial skills that made him use cement pavement technology in constructing the road. They pledged their continuous support for the governor. While appreciating the State government for the gestures, the Woman Leader of Old Umuahia Women Group, Lady Elizabeth Omelogu and the President General of the Community, Comrade Lambert Onuoha, described the rigid pavement technology as the first in the history of the Local government Area, adding that the road has given them unhindered access to the Enugu – Port Harcourt Express Way and other communities in the state.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-833531" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598378746791.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="480" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598378746791.jpg 720w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/FB_IMG_1598378746791-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px"> They praised the governor for prioritizing the project which has posed a challenge to the community for many years and prayed God to reward him with long life and prosperity.

Nigerian Billionaire, Terry Waya has given his blessing to the relationship between his son, Kiddwaya and Erica. Kiddwaya and Erica became lovers in the BBNaija lockdown edition barely a few weeks into the show. Media Mogul, Dele Momodu during an Instagram live session with Terry Waya on Thursday night, asked if he is ready to be a father-in-law to Erica. Responding, Waya said they both have his blessings, adding that he does not care if his son who hails from Benue State chooses to be in a relationship with Erica from the western part of Nigeria. He added that he has best friends in every region of the country and would respect Kiddwaya’s decision “You know me I cut across all sections in Nigeria, any part of the country I go too, I‘m at home. “There’s no place in Nigeria I do not have best friends. “Anywhere my children decide to settle and set up a home they have my blessing. We are all one; it does not matter which culture or language you speak. “Whoever he chooses, as a father I’ll always support him. I’m prepared to do a Versace wedding in Italy and also one here for the fans in Nigeria.”

There was pandemonium on Monday as angry youths protested the death of an Okada rider, who was reportedly killed on the Ogun State portion of the Lagos-Ibadan highway. The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement (TRACE) Corps said the okada rider was crushed to death by a truck, marked XA 539 BBJ. TRACE Corps said the accident happened around Olowotedo, opposite Deeper Life, on the Lagos-Ibadan highway. TRACE Spokesman, Babatunde Akinbiyi, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST in Abeokuta. According to Akinbiyi, the road crash occurred around 11am. It was gathered that a hit-and-run car had knocked down the motorcycle, marked WDE 415 VD, to the side of the moving truck, which Akinbiyi said, unknowingly crushed the rider to death. “According to an eye witness, a hit-and-run car from behind hit the motorcyclist into the front of a moving truck, which ran over him and he died immediately,” he said. The incident, he added, “created a pandemonium for some minutes along the express road, with area boys beating and hitting everyone in sight because the deceased Okada rider is a resident in the area.” He spoke further that the driver of the truck had been arrested by policemen from Mowe Divisional Police Command. The body of the deceased had been deposited at the morgue of Idera Hospital, Sagamu, DAILY POST learnt.

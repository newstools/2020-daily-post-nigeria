Big Brother Naija lockdown housemate, Rebecca, popularly known as “Nengi” has told fellow housemate, Kiddwaya, that she feels a certain way about him. She, however, lamented that the Benue-born billionaire’s son has been avoiding her all along. Nengi has obviously become closer to Kidd since yesterday after he told Erica, his lover to find happiness elsewhere. Kiddwaya had told Erica that he can’t make her happy and obviously looks not to attach any seriousness to their relationship in the house. He said he is in the house to have fun and is now switching to Nengi. Nengi in the other hand now seems to be more interested in Kiddwaya than her friend, Ozo. Both were caught in a rather too closed position in the bathroom last night; an incident that got Ozo angry. During their private conversation in the kitchen last night, Nengi told Kidd, “I feel a certain way about you but right now, you are distancing yourself from me. “Why are you distancing yourself from me? Why were you bored with me? I want to know why. I don’t get bored with friends. “How do you get bored with someone you call your friend? In this house, if you are a friend to somebody, you need that person every single time…like you were naturally avoiding me…”

Obadiah Mailafia, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, has said that he has resigned from the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies, NIPSS. He said he had to resign because of ongoing killings in Southern Kaduna affecting his people. Recall that the former CBN Deputy Governor has been grilled twice by the Department of State Services (DSS) in Jos Office over his recent comments on the killings and Boko Haram terrorists. “I have resigned from NIPPS,” he told Daily Trust. “Nobody asked me or pressurized me to resign. I did it on my own. “I decided that I cannot continue working, with all my good conscience, when my people are continually being killed and genocide is being committed against my people. “That was the reason I gave, and the management has accepted my resignation,” he added. He explained that he gave NIPPS one month’s notice from 18th August to 18th September when his resignation will take effect. Mailafia maintained that his resignation is for the best interest of everybody. Mailafia, a former presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress, ADC, had last Monday honoured another invitation by the Department of State Services (DSS). DAILY POST recalls that it was the second time in five days that the DSS is interrogating Mailafia over comments he made on radio, concerning Boko Haram. Mailafia had among other things, alleged that a repentant bandit told him that a serving northern governor was a commander of the terrorist group.

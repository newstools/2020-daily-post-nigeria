A group known as the Core Middle Belt Value, CMBV, has expressed dismay that those in control of the institutions of the state have chosen to act as spokespersons to those behind the incessant killings in Southern Kaduna. The group noted that they (spokespersons), claimed that the killer herdsmen attacks were reprisals or revenge killings for previous attacks on the Fulani communities in Southern Kaduna. A joint statement from Mike Odeh Akatu, Dauda Ayuba Azzaman, Alex Agbo and Christie Oyine, National Publicity Officer,
Kaduna Chair, Member BOT, Kogi Chair and National Leader of the group, noted that before or after every attacks by the Fulani Herdsmen, heavily armed security personnel are always despatched and/or curfew imposed which prevents the youths of those communities from protecting their settlements from further attacks. Again, the statement explained that after the attacks, the youths are prevented from going after the marauders, adding that if they dare, they are stopped by the security personnel allegedly sent to protect them. The CMBV also noted that following the protests in Katsina, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt General Tukur Buratai, relocated to Katsina to fight banditry and Kidnappings in that state, stressing, “So, why is that of Southern Kaduna different?” Rather than offer protection, the group lamented that the Presidency is giving reasons as to why the Fulanis are attacking, adding that the failure of the governments to address the violence in Southern Kaduna and other parts of Middle Belt has contributed to an alarming rise in deadly genocidal tendencies involving armed men of Fulani extraction. The group recommended the removal of Police Commissioner in the Kaduna State and the redeployment of the General Officer Commanding 1 Mechanized Division, Kaduna. The group also recommended the removal of Director of DSS in Kaduna, and the reinstatement of traditional Chiefdoms which were downgraded by Governor El-Rufai when he became the governor of Kaduna State. The group suggested the removal of the four Emirates, namely Kauru, Kajuru, Kagarko and Lere which were established by El-Rufai and return to the former status quo, the implementation of the 2014 National Conference reports with particular reference to the Southern Kaduna, and that Governor El-Rufai should arrest the Killer herdsmen perpetuating the attacks on Southern Kaduna since he claimed that he met them and paid them to stop killing before now.

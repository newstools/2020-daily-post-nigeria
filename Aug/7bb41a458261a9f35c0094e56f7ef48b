The Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (FCCPC) has sealed Apple & Pears Ltd. It cited expired items in their retail and storage location in Abuja. Babatunde Irukera, FCCPC Chief Executive Officer, made the announcement in a statement on Thursday. He said it was disclosed that food products purchased were expired, even at the time of purchase. Upon further investigation, the commission discovered the company’s primary facility on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Irukera said although locked, innocuous and without signage, the FCCPC identified the specific location in the nation’s capital where the company had stored its products.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-828512" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/expire1.jpeg" alt="" width="432" height="984" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/expire1.jpeg 432w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/expire1-132x300.jpeg 132w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px"> Armed with sufficient initial evidence to proceed on enforcement, the commission conducted investigations at both the Lagos-Ibadan, and Abuja locations. FCCPC announced the discovery of large and inexplicable inventories of Laziz salad cream, Laziz mayonnaise, Laziz vegetable oil in sachets, and Laziz Thousand Island salad cream. The statement said in addition, the commission uncovered what appears to be unapproved and unsafe production, decanting, or repackaging of vegetable oil. “The location in Abuja is currently under seal, and will remain so until the Commission and NAFDAC have confiscated the expired or unwholesome products, and are otherwise satisfied that Apples and Pears can, and will operate safely and legally.”<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-828513" src="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exoire.jpeg" alt="" width="432" height="984" srcset="https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exoire.jpeg 432w, https://dailypost.ng/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/exoire-132x300.jpeg 132w" sizes="(max-width: 432px) 100vw, 432px">[

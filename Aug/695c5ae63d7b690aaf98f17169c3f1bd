Governor Godwin Obaseki of Edo State has said that the All Progressives Congress (APC) has been restless ever since last week when the Presidency sent a delegate to inspect one of his projects in the State. He said the opposition party is having a nightmare being confronted with facts about the role he played in the establishment of the modular refinery in Ologbo Local Government Area of the State. The Governor spoke through his Special Adviser on Media and Communication Strategy, Crusoe Osagie on Sunday, adding that the refinery was getting closer to being completed. “After last week’s visit of a Federal Government delegation to the Edo Modular Refinery in Ologbo, the APC is now clearly confused as their campaign seems to have been deflated by the stellar performance of Governor Obaseki and the near-total acceptance Obaseki enjoys from Edo people,” he said. He maintained that the truth about his administration’s performance will continue to dwarf and ultimately blot out falsehood and propaganda of the opposition party. He explained that the Presidency sent emissaries to Ologbo in Ikpoba Okha Local Government Area of the state last week, to inspect the refinery project. According to him, the government was satisfied with what they saw on the ground and “showered encomiums on Governor Obaseki for the landmark achievement.” He explained that during the visit, the seed investment of N700 million which the Obsseki administration made to kick-off this project was eloquently highlighted “Understandably, this event gave the opposition sleepless nights and this feeble lie is the response they have decided to deploy in an attempt to pacify their supporters who have been questioning their jaundiced criticisms of Governor Obaseki and transferring their allegiance in large numbers to the ‘wake and see governor,” he said. He was reacting to an earlier statement by the APC Media Campaign Council Chairman in Edo State, John Mayaki, who had told Governor Obaseki not to “take glory” for the refinery project.

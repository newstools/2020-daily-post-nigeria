The last eight of this year’s Champions League begins on Wednesday. Ahead of the second phase of knockout, Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski remains the highest goal scorer. The Polish striker has scored 13 times so far in the competition, three ahead of Erling Haaland who is out of the running following Borussia Dortmund’s elimination. Lewandowski is favourite to finish as top scorer, as his nearest competitor is Lyon forward, Memphis Depay, who faces Manchester City in this round. Depay has six goals, just like Gabriel Jesus (Man City), Raheem Sterling (Man City) and Serge Gnabry (Bayern Munich).

The Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai has reaffirmed his call for the Southern part of the country to produce Nigeria’s next president in 2023. El-Rufai said based on the zoning arrangement already in place since the inception of democracy in Nigeria, it is time for the southern part of the country to produce Nigeria’s next leader. Speaking on Channels Television, the governor said he does not support the idea of a northerner contesting for the president after the expiration of President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure. He stressed that no part of the country has a monopoly on power, hence Nigeria’s president should come from other parts of the country. “After Buhari, what is honourable is for the northern politicians to put their support for southern candidates. I don’t believe in zoning but that is my opinion. We have this arrangement, we should maintain it. “I don’t believe any part of Nigeria has a monopoly to power. We have an understanding, let us stick to it. In 1998, this nation had a consensus that power should go to the southwest,” El-Rufai said. Recall that El-Rufai while speaking with BBC Hausa service recently had advocated for a Southern presidency while dismissing claims that he had interest to run for the presidency in 2023.

Cult clash between Skylo and Scorpion cult groups in Akpabuyo local government area of Cross River State has reportedly claimed over lives. An eyewitness, who preferred anonymity, said that suspected cultists numbering over 50, armed with axes and locally made guns, were seen shooting sporadically from Maternity axis to Forestry checkpoint in Akpabuyo. He said people were seen running helter-skelter, adding that businesses in the area were closed. According to him, Scorpion members started the shooting and butchering of Skylo members. “Over five persons were reportedly gunned down during the clash while property worth millions of naira was destroyed,” he said. When contacted via phone on Sunday, the State Security Adviser to Governor Ben Ayade, South, Ani Esin said “We have some cult-related clashes in Akpabuyo local government area of the State which degenerated into communal differences and we are trying to see what we can do to curtail it. We will handle the cult issue first then go into communal differences”. Also speaking with DAILY POST, the Permanent Secretary, Governor’s Office, in charge of Security, Dr Alfred Mboto lamented over the situation. “As at yesterday when I got distress calls, I immediately called the Commissioner of Police and the Brigade Commander. They sent security personnel to the area to maintain law and order. “The security men trailed the alleged cultists to a place called Ifondo. The incident was cult clash and the suspects used the opportunity to rob. There were sporadic gunshots,” he revealed.

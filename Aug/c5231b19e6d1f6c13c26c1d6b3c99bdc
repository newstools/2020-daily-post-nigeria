The Supreme Council for Sharia in Nigeria, SCSN, has attacked the the Nigerian Bar Association, NBA, for dis-inviting Governor Nasir El-Rufai to its Annual General Conference. The council accused the NBA of taking side in the Southern Kaduna crisis. This was contained in a statement signed by the Secretary General of the Council, Nafi’u Baba-Ahmad, and made available to reporters on Saturday. The Sharia council was reacting to the removal of Governor Nasiru El-Rufai as one of the guest speakers at the NBA forthcoming conference. “For, clearly it has already taken side in the Southern Kaduna crises, contrary to its members training and what it loudly preaches, without listening to the narrative from the other side,” the statement said. “This clearly, lowly narrow political and religious sentiments have beclouded the judgment of the leadership of the NBA, forgetting the most basic principle of their training and that its members cut across all sides of the divide. “For the association to have taken side in a conflict in such a blatantly pedestrian manner is demeaning of its status,” it added. Recall that the Muslim Rights Concern, MURIC, had earlier condemned NBA’s decision to drop El-Rufai from the list of speakers at its 2020 Virtual Annual General Conference (AGC) which is billed to take place from 26th to 29th August, 2020. Also, the Muslim Lawyers Association of Nigeria (MULAN) in Kaduna State has shunned participation in the conference over the exclusion of El-Rufai as speaker. The NBA had withdrawn its invitation to Governor El-Rufai, following protests from some lawyers.

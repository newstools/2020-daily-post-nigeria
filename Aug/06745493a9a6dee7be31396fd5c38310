The serving Overseer of the Citadel Global Community Church (CGCC), Pastor Tunde Bakare, has warned against the reopening of churches as directed by the Lagos State Government. During his sermon on Sunday, the cleric urged Christians not to let any religious leader or government official, to lead them like a sheep to the slaughterhouse. Bakare said: “I have to appeal to you once again, please keep safe and do your best to stay alive. Do not let anyone, whether religious leader or governmental leader, to drive you like a sheep to the slaughter. “If they (the government and the disease control authorities) said that the month of August is going to be the peak of the infection, why should they ask people to rush in (re-open the churches) again? “Please keep safe and do your best to keep alive by keeping all the necessary rules. We know that by the grace of God this pandemic like the others before it has an expiry date. It shall not see our end. We shall see its end in the mighty name of Jesus.” On Saturday, Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu announced the lifting of ban on religious gatherings. Churches and mosques have been closed since March 2020, in a bid to contain the COVID-19 outbreak.

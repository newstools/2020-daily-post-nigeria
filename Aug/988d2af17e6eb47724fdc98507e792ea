Prof. Kemebradikumo Pondei, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, CEO, Expanded Interim Management Committee, EIMC, Niger Delta Development Commission, NDDC, has expressed surprise that people thought he was mimicking actors in movies when he fainted at the House of Representatives some weeks ago. Pondei unexpectedly fainted while being questioned by members of the House of Reps exactly one month ago. The NDDC MD told Vanguard that he had a mysterious and unpredictable health challenge that led to the scenario. “I had an unexplained, unexpected health challenge. It is ridiculous to think that people believed I was acting, the MD said. I would not pray for anyone to experience what I went through. I do not run from issues. I have put all that behind me. DAILY POST reported that Pondei slumped while taking questions from the members of the House of Reps committee. He had appeared alongside the Minister for Niger Delta Affairs, Godswill Akpabio to answer questions on issues bothering on financial misconduct in the commission. The Acting NDDC boss had fainted while one of the committee members was speaking, leading to disruption of the hearing as efforts were made to revive him. Pondei’s collapse had led to a 30-minute adjournment of the session.

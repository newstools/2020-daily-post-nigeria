FA Cup champions, Arsenal, are set to offer a player, plus cash for Sporting Lisbon’s Joelson Fernandes, Mirror UK reports. Fernandes has a £40million release clause in his current contract with Sporting. Arsenal is keen to avoid paying Fernandes’s clause and will bid to lower the asking price by offering one of their players in a part-exchange deal. Mikel Arteta’s side is favourites to land Fernandes ahead of Borussia Dortmund and Juventus. The Gunners have a host of players up for grabs this summer including midfielders, Lucas Torreira and Matteo Guendouzi. Fernandes is attracting attention from big clubs across Europe and is the latest forward to emerge from Sporting’s renowned youth ranks – which produced the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Ricardo Quaresma and Nani. The 17-year-old has represented Portugal at youth level.

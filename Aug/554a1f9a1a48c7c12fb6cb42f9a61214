Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has insisted his job is safe at the club, even if they don’t overtun a 1-0 deficit to Lyon in the Champions League on Friday. Earlier this month, Sarri led the Turin club to a ninth successive Serie A title. However, the Bianconeri lost four of their 12 matches after the restart. Sarri is aware that despite the domestic dominance, the true test for any Juve coach comes in the Champions League, which they have not won since 1996. “I don’t think it will be my last match,” Sarri told reporters on Thursday, when asked if he thought he would be axed if the team is eliminated. “I think I’m dealing with top-level managers – they’re not amateurs. They’ve already made their evaluations, independently of the result tomorrow. “This question implies that the managers are fans and that they merely follow the emotional wave.” Sarri has two more years left on his current contract with the Italian champions.

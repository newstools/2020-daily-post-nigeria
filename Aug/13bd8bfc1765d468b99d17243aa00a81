She said this during her diary session with Wathoni, who stood in place for Big Brother on Thursday. Erica disclosed that she had been searching for her father and got to speak to him through someone who contacted her on Instagram with the same surname. Erica said: “Someone contacted me on Instagram and told me we have the same surname and asked to be friends. “I had been searching for my dad and then when we met she asked me to speak to her father who had the same name with mine and all of a sudden I found out it was my dad “I was 23 at that time and it was overwhelming and shocking. “My dad did not sound surprised but later we met in Lagos, which was a weird scenario and has been so for a while.” She added that though she has forgiven him, she still feels resentment towards him sometimes.

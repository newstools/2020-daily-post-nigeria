As students in exit classes prepare to resume in Lagos on Monday, August 3, the Office of Education Quality Assurance has issued guidelines for re-opening of schools. It urged owners to adhere to the guidelines, as reopening and assessment of schools will be done simultaneously. The Director-General, Mrs Abiola Seriki-Ayeni, stated this while briefing newsmen in Ikeja, Lagos. Seriki-Ayeni, who reiterated that school re-opening is for SS3 students alone, noted that the guidelines were in accordance with the federal government’s stance. She advised both approved or unapproved private school owners, to study the released guidelines and develop a template for their re-opening plans. “What is expected of them during the training is that they have to create their own re-opening plans based on our template on distance learning plans, blended learning plans, health and safety protocols like fumigation of classrooms, provision of running water and soap for handwashing. “Others include staggering of student’s time to maintain social distancing and taking of measurements to figure out how many students to be physically together at a point in time. “Health and Safety officers must be available at the premises and schools must also have a plan for Ciovid-19 like having knowledge of local isolation centres. They must also have learning managers that will ensure that students are learning either at home or in school. He will keep track of assessment to measure the quality of students learning, help teachers with learning plans and the curriculum”. Seriki-Ayeni added that private schools must register for clearance in readiness for re-opening, by visiting the agency website on www.oeqalagos.com or www.lagoslearnstogether.com to fill in basic data about their schools.

Oba of Benin, Oba Ewuare II, on Thursday, proposed a single term of six years for president and governors. He said this would reduce tension and violence associated with the election and re-election. NAN reports that the monarch spoke when the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu, visited him in Benin on Thursday. “I am not an expert on political analysis, but I want to suggest that if possible after this election, come up with a single term of six years and mechanism to review leaders’ performance periodically “If that is in place, a candidate also knows that within the six years he can also be removed for not performing. I think that will go a long way to reduce tension associated with reelection.” He appealed to youths not to sacrifice their lives for politicians. “Once they get into office, they forget the sacrifice you made for them. They often keep their children away from the streets during electioneering.” The Oba expressed worry about the spate of violence in Edo. “We are appealing to the political actors not to turn the state into a battleground. All those who want to turn the land into a battleground, the law of Karma will visit them one by one. “I am not happy that my children are fighting. I tried my best to intervene but to no avail. But God is in charge of the situation and I know that the election will be peaceful,” he said. Oba Ewuare announced plans to invite the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Governor Godwin Obaseki and the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Ize Iyanmu, for a meeting. The traditional ruler urged President Muhammadu Buhari to empower the security agencies on intelligence gathering. “If they are well empowered, they will be able to forestall the attack carried out at the gate of the palace when the governor and his campaign team visited.”

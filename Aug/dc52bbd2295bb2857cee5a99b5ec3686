An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday ordered that an 18-year-old teenager, Tobi Ogunrinde, who allegedly defiled his neighbour’s seven-year-old daughter, be remanded. P. E. Nwaka, the Chief Magistrate, did not take the plea of Ogunrinde charged with indecent assault, defilement and sexual assault. He sent the defendant to the Nigerian Correctional Service in Kirikiri, pending legal advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The magistrate ordered the police to return the case file to the DPP and adjourned the case until September 18, NAN reports. Christopher John, the Prosecutor, alleged that the defendant committed the offences on April 17, at Governor’s Road, Ikotun, Lagos State. They contravened the provisions of Section 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The section prescribes life imprisonment upon conviction.

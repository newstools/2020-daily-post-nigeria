A group of persons, identified as the staff of Imo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission, ISOPADEC, have allegedly attacked Governor Hope Uzodinma’s convoy for failing to offset their three months salary arrears. DAILY POST gathered that the youths, who laid ambush on the Governor around Concorde Hotels, New Owerri, were armed. The Governor was on his way to Obinze Owerri west for an official assignment on Monday when they ambushed his entourage. The rampaging staff numbering up to twenty had among them a masquerade, a chain and padlocks on its body supposedly serving as their chief priest. It was reported that the windscreen of some of the vehicles in the Governor’s convoy were smashed and damaged. Fifteen of the staff were later arrested by the state Central Intelligent Department, CID of the Imo State police command for interrogation. Orlando Ikeokwu, who is the state Police Public Relations Officer said that the arrested staff of ISOPADEC are currently in the command’s custody.

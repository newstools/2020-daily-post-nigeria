Big Brother Naija, BBNaija 2020 housemate, Ozo has voiced out over triangle situation with Nengi and Dorathy. Ebuka Obi-Uchendu, official host of BBNaija during Sunday night eviction, asked Dorathy what she feels for Ozo. Dorathy insisted that she is just friends with Ozo and has no feelings for him. However, Brighto was not convinced, adding that he thinks Dorathy has feelings for Ozo. This caused tension in the house after the eviction show which had Eric and Tochi exit the house. Ozo, addressing the situation in a meeting with housemates, insisted that his relationship with Nengi and Dorathy is a straight line not a triangle as assumed. According to him, Dorathy is his close friend and she would make the worst mistake of her life if she ends their friendship because of public perception. Ozo said: “It is my decision to still be around Nengi without anyone’s approval “The worst mistake you will make is to let public perception ruin the kind of relationship we have.” He further reiterated that he still has feelings for Nengi as much as he has always had.

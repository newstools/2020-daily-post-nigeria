The Executive Vice Chairman of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, has said 2.2 improperly-registered Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) cards across Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) have been completely deactivated. Danbatta, at the weekend in Abuja, said the action was sequel to a ministerial directive that the NCC should compel service providers to block all improperly-registered SIM cards, pending when their owners regularise their registration. The EVC recalled that prior to the directive, NCC Compliance Monitoring and Enforcement Team, had reduced the number of questionable SIM cards in the country to 9.2 million. He stated that the deactivation was contrary to reports by a section of the media “suggesting that nothing has been done with respect to the issue of improperly-registered SIM cards”. Danbatta assured that the NCC will continue to aggressively pursue the national objectives of delivering an accurate database of telephone subscribers in Nigeria. He stated that the SIM data submitted to the Commission is constantly being validated for higher efficiency to support the national security objectives of the SIM registration exercise through NCC’s zero tolerance for deviations from the proper registration process. Danbatta restated NCC’s commitment to the periodic SIM data audit, continuous compliance monitoring exercise on the MNOs, as well as constant consumer education and engagement against using improperly-registered SIM cards. The EVC restated its resolve to partner with stakeholders to address national security concerns, especially kidnappings, banditry, armed robberies, cattle rustling and other crimes associated with SIM cards across and to ensure that same are traceable to their real owners.

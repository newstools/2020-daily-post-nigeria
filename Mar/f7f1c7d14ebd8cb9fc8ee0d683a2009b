Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has admitted that failure to qualify for the Champions League, could mean he struggles to attract top talent. The Gunners’ hopes of qualifying for Europe’s elite club competition came to an end last Thursday after they crashed out against Olympiakos. It leaves Arsenal facing a fourth consecutive year without Champions League football. “It’s a no-brainer,” Arteta told reporters when asked if it was easier to sign players with Champions League qualification secured. “Every player in the world wants to play Champions League and if you talk about having this option on the table, players are much more open to join or renew their contract.” Arsenal sit in 10th place in the Premier League but might be able to qualify for the Champions League if they finish fifth, provided Manchester City’s two-year ban is upheld. “The structure of this club is built to be in the Champions League and you can sustain that for a year or two, but then after that, you have to start making decisions,” Arteta added. Arteta takes his team to Portsmouth in the FA Cup on Monday night, before playing West Ham this weekend in the Premier League.

Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, has informed the club he will not return from Portugal, after his team-mate Daniele Rugani tested positive to coronavirus, the UK Sun reports. Ronaldo wants to take precautionary measures in an attempt to prevent it spreading. Serie A has been suspended until April 3, as Italy look to control the spread of the illness. Ronaldo had returned to his native Madeira to visit his mother after she suffered a stroke, but now the 35-year-old has chosen to remain there until it is safe to return. With his mother in the fragile state, Ronaldo will be especially wary of the risks of the coronavirus. Ronaldo and the rest of the squad were pictured celebrating alongside Rugani in the dressing room, following a 2-1 win over Inter Milan last weekend. The league fixture was played behind closed doors.

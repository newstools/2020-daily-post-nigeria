Former Manchester United defender, Rio Ferdinand, has admitted that Odion Ighalo has already proven him wrong at the club. Ferdinand was speaking on BT Sport, as Ighalo netted twice in United’s 3-0 win over Derby County in the FA Cup fifth round. A lot of questions were asked, when Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brought in the Nigerian striker on a six-month loan deal in January. Most pundits felt Ighalo, who had previously played for Watford in the Premier League, was not up to standard for the Old Trafford outfit. However, the 30-year-old now has three goals in just two starts for the Red Devils. “People and myself included were probably thinking Odion Ighalo, where does he fit into all of this? “If you have an opportunity to sign a player at the beginning of the January window, he is not the guy you are going to sign. “But what he does bring is a point. Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial want the ball in behind and not to bring people in. “To be there first is great considering the pressure he is under. He’s in the centre of goal and he’s a physical presence. That’s what he adds to this team,” Ferdinand said.

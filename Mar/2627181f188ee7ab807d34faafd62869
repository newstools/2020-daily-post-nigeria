Former Juventus midfielder, Claudio Marchisio, has urged Manchester United star, Paul Pogba to leave Old Trafford for the Old Lady. Marchisio, who played alongside Pogba during their time at Juventus, believes the France World Cup winner will be ‘reborn’ at the Turin club. “I would be delighted [if he returns to Juventus]. I told him that he was wrong to go to Manchester and that if he wanted to change, he should choose Spain,” Marchisio told Tuttosport. “Having said that, Pogba’s return would be extremely positive. Paul Pogba would be reborn in the environment he loves and looks after him most. “And he would give Juventus a lot as they need someone like him in the middle. He is a great professional.” Pogba, who is widely expected to leave Man United at the end of this season, has drawn interest from Real Madrid and Juventus in the past. His current deal at Man United will expire at the end of next season. The 27-year-old is currently recovering from ankle surgery and has been out of action for several weeks.

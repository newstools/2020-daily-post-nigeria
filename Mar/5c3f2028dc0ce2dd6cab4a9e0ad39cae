Former Chelsea midfielder Michael Ballack, has disclosed that he regretted leaving the club in 2010 because he wanted to retire at Stamford Bridge. Ballack left Chelsea in 2010 after the Blues board refused to give him a two-year contract extension. Chelsea offered Ballack a one-year deal to adhere to their club policy at the time. Still, instead of accepting the contract, the ex-Germany international returned to Bayer Leverkusen because he wanted a two-year deal. Speaking on Sky Sports’ Transfer Talk podcast, Ballack said: “Carlo Ancelloti wants me to stay at Chelsea, but the club decided only to give players of that age [30 above] a one-year deal. I wanted two. “Today, I can say maybe it was wrong. I should have stayed at Chelsea, even for that one year. “I could never imagine that I would return to Bayer Leverkusen. Until the last day, I actually thought we would find a way at Chelsea. “I was hoping I could stay until the end [of my career].” Ballack spent four years at Chelsea and won the Premier League, two FA Cups, the League Cup and the Community Shield.

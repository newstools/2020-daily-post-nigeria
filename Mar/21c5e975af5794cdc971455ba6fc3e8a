Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in the state, which takes effect from Sunday (tomorrow). Sanwo-Olu announced this during a press briefing on Friday. It came on the day when the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), confirmed the country has recorded 81 coronavirus cases, with 52 in Lagos alone. Sanwo-Olu said the state is heading towards a lockdown, but a number of factors were being considered before some decisions are made. The Governor added that the domestic airport will be shut for two weeks. “We are moving in the direction of a total lockdown but there are numbers or indices that we need to see before we carry it out, which we have yet to see. We need to see a huge spike in the numbers of confirmed cases, so, we are looking at that. “I am hereby directing a statewide curfew from 8pm to 6am, starting from Sunday until further notice. This is to enable us to carry out comprehensive disinfection of the Lagos Metropolis. “I am pleased to note that we have taken possession of over 200 disinfecting machines, and starting today, we will be disinfecting all major highways, bus stops, markets, parks, and other public areas. “With effect from Sunday, we will be closing the domestic airport in Lagos, the General Aviation Terminal and the MM2. All movements in and out of Lagos through the two domestic terminals will, therefore, be suspended from Sunday for two weeks in the first instance. The only exceptions will be flights carrying essential supplies and those on emergency operations,” Sanwo-Olu said.

Given the current global outbreak of Coronavirus, President Muhammadu Buhari, on Monday established a Presidential Task Force for the Control of the Coronavirus-19 Disease (COVID-19). A statement sent to DAILY POST on Monday, signed by Garba Shehu, his Spokesman, said the President’s action was in preparation for the unlikely but probable major outbreak of the disease in the country which will require a multi-sectoral inter-governmental approach as advised by the World Health Organisation (WHO), similar to that adopted for the HIV epidemic in the last two decades. The start and finish task group which would be expected to deliver within a maximum period of six months comprise the following: a. Mr. Boss Mustapha (SGF) – Chair b. Dr. Sani Aliyu – National Coordinator c. Hon. Minister of Health d. Hon. Minister of Interior e. Hon. Minister of Aviation f. Hon.

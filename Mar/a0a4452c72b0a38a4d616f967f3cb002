The national leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) on Thursday promised to review its ongoing two weeks warning strike. DAILY POST recalls that ASUU embarked on the warning strike last week Monday. ASUU National President, Prof Abiodun Ogunyemi, said this after a meeting with the House Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila at the National Assembly. Ogunyemi affirmed that the union will consult with its various structures across different universities in the country and get back to the Speaker “early next week.” At the meeting, Gbajabiamila, however, wondered why the Federal government could not fulfil its 2019 agreement with ASUU, 10 years after it was struck. DAILY POST gathered that ASUU is against the issue concerning the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS) approved for implementation by the Federal government. But Gbajabiamila appealed to the union to bend over backwards and support any government’s efforts at fighting corruption in the country. The House Speaker also urged ASUU leadership to suspend the ongoing two weeks warning strike so that a solution could be found to resolve the impasse. He added, “the House would do everything within its powers to appropriate funds that would take care of the financial demands of ASUU”. Present at the meeting were Principal Officers of the House, including House Leader Alhassan Ado Doguwa; Chief Whip Mohammed Tahir Monguno; Deputy Leader Peter Akpatason; Deputy Whip Nkeiruka Onyejeocha; Minority Leader Ndudi; Minority Whip Gideon Gwani; Deputy Minority Leader Toby Okechukwu and Deputy Minority Whip Adesegun Adekoya. Others were the Minister of State for Education Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, former ASUU President, Prof Nasiru Isa Fagge, among others.

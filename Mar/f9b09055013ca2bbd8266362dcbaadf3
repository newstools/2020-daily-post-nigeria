Lagos State Police Command, on Monday, announced that three pastors were arrested for flouting the government’s directive on gatherings. Deputy Commissioner of Police Mohammed Ali in charge of Operations, Lagos Command, confirmed the arrest to NAN. Lagos had declared that the number of people at social and religious gatherings should not exceed 50, a figure further reduced to 20. Ali stated that one of the pastors arrested is from a Pentecostal Church. Ali disclosed that the pastors were not detained but warned to comply with the government’s directive to prevent further spread of coronavirus. “We did not hold our weekly prayers in the mosque at the police headquarters because we had to comply with the directive of the Lagos State Government. “I also implore churches and other religious organisations to follow suit,” he said. Ali added that the operations to ensure the public complies would continue and warned religious leaders to obey or face the consequences.

The deadly coronavirus has killed 368 people within 24 hours in Italy. Italy is the second worst hit country – after China, the origin – as the outbreak is fast spreading. There are fears that deaths in the country may surpass the figure in China if the infection rate continues to surge. Al-Jazeera reports that authorities said the death toll hit 1,809 while the number of positive cases rose to 24,747 from 21,157 on Saturday. Italy’s civil protection authority gave the figures on Sunday. Similarly, Iran has announced that more than 100 people have died in the past 24 hours. The country’s coronavirus cases are now approximately 14,000 and Tehran says its fight
is being hindered by United State sanctions. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has declared coronavirus a global pandemic. The disease has killed nearly 6,000 people globally in less than 3 months.

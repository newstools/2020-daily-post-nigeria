Reno Omokri, a former aide to President Goodluck Jonathan on New Media, has claimed that nobody has seen President Muhammadu Buhari for a week as coronavirus (COVID-19) continue to spread across Nigeria. Omokri said this while reacting to report of British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, testing positive for COVID-19. DAILY POST recalls that Boris Johnson, on Friday, revealed that he had contracted the deadly disease. He said: “Over the last 24 hours, I have developed mild symptoms and tested positive for coronavirus. “I am now self-isolating, but I will continue to lead the government’s response via video-conference as we fight this virus. “Together, we will beat this. #StayHomeSaveLives.” Reacting to the development, Omokri, who hailed Johnson for taking time to address UK citizens, said it was not Buhari’s style to address Nigerians in this difficult time. Omokri wrote on Twitter: “Even when he has tested positive for #CoronaVirus, UK Prime Minister, @BorisJohnson, still addressed the UK public live today. But in Nigeria, no one has seen General @MBuhari for a week because it is not “his style” to address those he leads.” Meanwhile, the National Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, had disclosed on Thursday that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria now stands at 65.

The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) has confirmed that the Copa del Rey final between Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao has been postponed, due to the coronavirus pandemic. Both Basque clubs were to play for the trophy on April 18. But RFEF is set to reschedule the match for May 30. Also, at least the next two matchdays in Spain’s top two tiers will be played behind closed doors. However, the national footballers’ union has requested for matches to be suspended. The RFEF also announced on Wednesday that all non-professional men’s and women’s football and futsal matches have been postponed for two weeks.

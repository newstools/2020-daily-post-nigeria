The gunmen shot sporadically in the area before abducting the victim into a tinted Hiace bus that was allegedly stationed at the premises of the filling station before they zoomed off. The incident caused serious tension within the community. When contacted for comments, the Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Mohammed Hafiz Inuwa said, “I am not privy to that honestly.” The Ovwian/Aladja Divisional Police Office, CSP Akintunde O O said, “The only one we got is a missing person. That they suspect that it is SSS that came to arrest him. “So, if you’re now changing it to abduction, I don’t see where it correlates. That’s the only one I heard from the President of the community that somebody was picked and they said they suspect those people that picked him to be SSS and we have already done a signal of missing person with his picture to be broadcast.” President of Aladja Community Council, Elder Ogbiruveta Otto, confirmed the abduction of the victim in a telephone chat with Our Correspondent in Warri, said, “Yes, it is true and it has been confirmed that an incident like that happened in Aladja.

The Federal Government of Nigeria has directed public servants to work from home in order to stop the spread of coronavirus. The directive was contained in a memo on Monday by Yemi Esan, Head of Civil Service. Public servants across the country from level 12 and below were asked to work while at home. Those that remain at work have been ordered to limit the number of visitors that they receive. “As you are no doubt aware, the Federal Government has taken a number of measures to manage the identified cases of COVID-19 and curtail its spread”, it read. The HoS said government was concerned about the welfare and safety of all public servants just as it is about other Nigerians. “All public servants are, therefore, strongly advised to follow the measures being put in place by government to curtail the spread of the pandemic. “As a further step to check the spread of COVID-19, all non-essential pubiic servants on grade level 12 and below are to work from home with effect from Tuesday 24th March, 2020 until further notice.”

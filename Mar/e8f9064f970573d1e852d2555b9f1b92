Arsene Wenger has raided his former club, to poach Jason Rosenfeld for a new role at FIFA, The Athletic reports. Rosenfeld has been in charge of the Gunners’ data and analytics for almost a decade. Wenger left the Emirates in 2018 and has since taken up a role as Head of Global Football Development with FIFA. The Frenchman has identified analytics as an area that needs improvement in the global game and has brought in Rosenfeld to assist him. The two men had a good working relationship, with Rosenfeld having overseen StatDNA, an analytics company Arsenal bought in 2012. StatDNA was bought for £2million and moved in-house, with the club rebranding it to Arsenal Data Analytics.

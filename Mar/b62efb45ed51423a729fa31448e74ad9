Shanghai Shenhua has placed a £15million price tag on Odion Ighalo, the UK Mirror reports. Ighalo is currently on a six-month loan deal at Manchester United. The Nigerian striker has impressed United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer since his arrival. In eight appearances, Ighalo has netted four goals for the Red Devils. It has led to suggestions that the 30-year-old could be signed to a permanent deal at Old Trafford. Ighalo cost Shanghai Shenhua €15million (approximately £13.6 million), when he was bought from Changchun Yatai. He became the most expensive Nigerian player, when he was sold by Watford to Changchun Yatai for a fee in the region of £21million in January 2017. That record was first broken by Leicester City’s Kelechi Iheanacho, then Everton’s Alex Iwobi.

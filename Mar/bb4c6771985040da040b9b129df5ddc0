The Managing Director of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Hadiza Usman, has cleared the air on being in a relationship with Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State. Hadiza speaking with TVC during the celebration of the International Women’s Day on Monday debunked the allegation making the rounds that she is ‘El-Rufai’s girlfriend’ She stressed that she didn’t sleep with anyone to move up the ladders in her career or either have a romantic relationship with El-Rufai. According to her, El-Rufai is just her boss and mentor. Ms Usman was the Chief of Staff to Governor El-Rufai from 2015 to 2016 before she emerged the NPA boss in July 2016. “The governor of Kaduna state is my mentor and my boss. I am not El-Rufai’s girlfriend. “The governor has been very supportive of my career and that of every other woman that has worked for him. “Kaduna State is the first state in northern Nigeria that has an elected female deputy governor; so you can see he has that commitment having women in positions of authority, so that rumour is completely untrue,” Ms Usman noted. “These are the things they say to women to pull us down, they say for everything you have done in terms of showcasing your competence, they always reference and attribute it to the fact that you are in a relationship with another person. “The bottom line is that you got a job and you perform, so when people reference that you got there because you were somebody’s girlfriend, that is a pull down,” she added.

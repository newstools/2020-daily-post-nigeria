Barely 24 hours after the inauguration of Fund Raising Committee on Covid-19 in Kano State by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, individuals and corporate organizations have started responding positively. An elder statesman and multi billionaire business mogul, Alhaji Aminu Alhassan Dantata, has announced a donation of N300million to the committee. In addition, Kano-based businessmen, Alhaji Abba Sumaila and Alhaji Abubakar Dalhatu, chairman Al-Amsad Group, have donated 500 sacks of spaghetti and N5million respectively. In the same vein all commissioners and political office holders in the state have also donated 50 percent of their salaries to the noble cause. The first donation of N28.5million from UBA was yesterday announced by Governor Ganduje at the inauguration ceremony, while Africa’s richest man, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, had pledged to provide all needed facilities for the earmarked 600-bed Isolation Centre at Sani Abacha Stadium, Kano. The 38-member committee was set up to seek for and collect donations from corporate organizations and individuals in cash or kind and distribute same to those in need so as to cushion the harsh effect of the measures being taken by government against the spread of Covid-19 in Kano. The committee urged organizations and well to do individuals within and outside the state to donate generously towards this humanitarian gesture. Anyone willing to donate to the committee in cash is to pay/transfer to this account: Kano State COVID-19 Support, UBA, Account No: 1022751785. Donations in kind are also collected at a warehouse at number 94, Maganda Road and Kano State Government Printing Press, Emir’s Palace Road.

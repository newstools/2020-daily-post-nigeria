The embattled National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has claimed that a minister serving in President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration and some governors, are responsible for his ordeal in the party. According to The Sun, Oshiomhole stated this while speaking after a closed-door meeting with Buhari in Aso Rock today. The former Edo State Governor, however, did not mention any names. He went on to describe himself as a child of light who will always defeat darkness. Oshiomhole met with Buhari, shortly after Justice Lewis Allagoa of the Federal High Court in Kano, set aside a ruling of the FCT High Court suspending him as APC’s national chairman.

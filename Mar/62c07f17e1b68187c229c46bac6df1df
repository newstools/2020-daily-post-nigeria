The apex Igbo socio-cultural youth organization, Ohanaeze Youth Council(OYC), has expressed concern on the dwindling oil price in the nation’s economy. The Igbo group solicited for the engagement of competent hands to help President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government manage the economy, positing that the Economic Team constituted by Buhari has run short of ideas and would further ground the economy of Nigeria. OYC, in a press release signed by the President-General, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro and Secretary-General, Okwu Nnabuike, forwarded to DAILY POST on Friday, also begged South East Governors to channel their resources to support youths to engage in agriculture to prepare for the looming recession and hardship ahead. According to the release which read partly, “Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide had studied diligently the rhetorics of the Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC),Mele Kyari on the recent crash of crude Oil prices to less than 30 dollars per barrel and warning Nigerians to prepare for tough times ahead. OYC agreed with Kyari and insists that Nigerians will experience hunger and hardship in the face of obvious collapse of the economy depending solely on Crude Oil in the nearby future. “The appointment of Dr Ngozi Okonjo Iweala by South African Government, President of South Africa had demonstrated courage and determination to succeed in the face of economic adversity by hiring a Foreign Adviser (Okonjo iweala), We call for a total overhaul of the entire Economic team of Mr President. This is a wakeup call to bring in a good Economic Team to develop non oil sectors and ensure that we avoid going back to recession”.

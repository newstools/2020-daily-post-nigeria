A Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court in Yaba, Lagos on Wednesday ordered that a 27-year-old carpenter, Idowu Tajudeen, who allegedly stabbed his neighbour to death with a kitchen knife during an argument, be remanded in Ikoyi Custodial Centre. NAN reports that the Chief Magistrate Oluwatoyin Oghre, who gave the order, did not take the plea of Tajudeen, who is charged with murder. She ordered that the case file be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for legal advice. Magistrate Oghre adjourned the case until July 28. Earlier, the Prosecution Counsel, Sgt. Modupe Olaluwoye, told the court that Tajudeen committed the offence at 7.20p.m. on March 2, at Temu village in Epe area of Lagos.

The offence, he said, contravened the provisions of Section 222 and is punishable under Section 223 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised).

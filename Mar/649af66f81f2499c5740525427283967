Former Liverpool player, Michael Owen, has claimed that the major difference between Jurgen Klopp’s side and Atletico Madrid was the goalkeeper. Owen said this while reacting to Liverpool’s UEFA Champions League 3-2 defeat against Diego Simeone’s men on Wednesday night. Atletico Madrid arrived at Anfield with a slim advantage after winning 1-0 at the Wanda Metropolitano last month. Liverpool leveled the tie within 90 minutes through Georginio Wijnaldum’s header, and Robert Firmino made it 2-0 early in extra time. However, Marcos Llorente scored twice to swing the tie in Atletico’s favour, before Alvaro Morata netted the third goal as the game ended 4-2 on aggregate. “There is no question whatsoever that every single big team around Europe has just breathed a huge sigh of relief, Liverpool are out, and I’ve got no doubts that they are the best team in Europe at the moment,” Owen told BT Sport. “Yes, they’ve been beaten over two legs, but they are still the best team in Europe, and they were outstanding for 90 minutes. “As Rio Ferdinand said, the difference between the two sides was the goalkeepers.”

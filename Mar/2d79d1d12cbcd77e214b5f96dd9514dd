Aisha Yusufu, co-convener of the BringBackOurGirls campaign group, has blasted President Muhammadu Buhari over his nationwide broadcast on Sunday. Following pressure from Nigerians and the legislature, the President finally, for the first time since the coronavirus disease entered Nigeria, addressed the nation. However, Mrs Yusufu, who is an ardent critic of Buhari and his administration, was not happy with the content of the message delivered by the President. President Buhari had during the addressed said, “We are working with [Federal] Ministry of Health on protecting our citizens from #COVID-19, as a government, this is now a key priority for us.” Aisha wonders if Buhari still knows he is the President of the country. She tweeted in response to Buhari’s speech, “He is working with the Ministry of Health? Are you sure Buhari still knows he is President? “Anyway those who said he shouldn’t address how do they feel? Finally this address is adequately inadequate! Let him do one in hausa. We will translate.”

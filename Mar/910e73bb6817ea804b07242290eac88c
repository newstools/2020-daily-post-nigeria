Former Liverpool striker, Michael Owen has predicted the scoreline of the match between RB Leipzig and Tottenham Hotspur on Tuesday. Leipzig will tonight host Jose Mourinho’s men at Red Bull Arena in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie. The Bundesliga giants defeated Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in the first leg last month. Providing his prediction, Owen wrote on his Betvictor column: “Hit by injuries and low on confidence, it has been a difficult spell for Spurs recently. “RB Leipzig won the first leg thanks to Timo Werner penalty at Tottenham, and they now have home advantage. “I’m going for RB Leipzig to compound Tottenham’s bad run with a 2-0 victory.” The match kick-off time is at 9 pm.

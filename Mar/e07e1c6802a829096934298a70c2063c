Former Manchester United star, Owen Hargreaves, has urged the club to sign Leicester City’s Wilfred Ndidi if they want to compete for the Premier League title in the near future. He also wants the Red Devils to sign Dortmund’s Jadon Sancho and Birmingham City’s Jude Bellingham. The former Manchester City star said this ahead of Man United’s Premier League clash against Brighton on April 4. “It is not about quantity, it is about quality,” Hargreaves told Premier League Productions. “If Man United can have a Jadon Sancho (right-winger) it would make a huge difference. “Bellingham is 16 or 17, and he is going to be a super player. “I think they also need somebody like Ndidi, a defensive sitter. if you have Pogba and Fernandes, then i think you need a defensive one.”

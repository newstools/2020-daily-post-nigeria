Former Brazil striker, Pele, has shared his opinion on who is the better player between Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, and Juventus superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo. Pele believes Ronaldo is technically superior to Messi because the Portugal captain is more consistent than the Argentine captain. Ronaldo has won the Ballon d’Or awards five times in the last thirteen years, while Messi has won it six times. Asked to choose between Ronaldo and Messi, Pele told YouTube channel Pilhado: “Today the best player in the world is Cristiano Ronaldo. “I think Ronaldo is the best because he’s more consistent, but you can’t forget about Lionel Messi, of course, but he’s not a striker.” “It is a question that is difficult to answer,” the 79-year-old added. “We cannot forget about Zico, Ronaldinho, and Ronaldo. “In Europe, we have Franz Beckenbauer and Johan Cruyff. “Now, it is not my fault, but I think Pele was better than them all.”

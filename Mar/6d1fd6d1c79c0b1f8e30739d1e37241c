A total of 223 children including 10 girls have been released from Nigerian Army administrative custody and Maiduguri Maximum Security Prison after being cleared of suspected ties with armed groups. They were released to the safe custody of Borno State Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development, UNICEF and Borno State authorities in Maiduguri, north-east Nigeria. In a press statement signed by the Borno state Communication Officer UNICEF, Samuel Kaalu, the children will immediately be enrolled in a reintegration programme to enable them to re-engage with their families. Some of the children are reported to have been missing for up to four and five years, with many presumed dead by their families. UNICEF Country Representative, Peter Hawkins says the release of the children is a huge step forward towards ensuring the well-being of children in conflict areas “These children deserve to have a normal childhood – and now require our full care and support to re-enter the lives that were so brutally interrupted by this devastating conflict.” Now in its tenth year, the conflict in the north-east Nigeria continues to uproot and devastate the lives of tens of thousands of children, women and men. Since 2016, about 1,743 children associated with armed groups (1,125 boys, 618 girls) have been released from administrative custody.

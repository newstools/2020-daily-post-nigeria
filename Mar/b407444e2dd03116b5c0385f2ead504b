The Comptroller Kaduna Central Correctional Centre, Mohammed Babangida, says the riot by prison inmates had been brought under control. The inmates were said to have protested over an “outbreak” on coronavirus. He told newsmen that normalcy had been restored and all the prisoners taken back to their cells. Babangida said there was no casualty from the disturbances contained with the assistance of the police, soldiers and other security operatives. Gunshots scared residents around the facility to rush out of their homes. Asked if the crisis was as a result of fear of COVID-19 virus, Babangida stated that there are no cases. “We have our health workers here and they are working tirelessly to address such and as I speak to you, we do not have such case here.” NAN reports there was large presence of security personnel around the Correctional Centre located on Independence Way, Kaduna.

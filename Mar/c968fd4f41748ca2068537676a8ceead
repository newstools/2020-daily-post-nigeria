Former military Head of State, Abdulsalami Abubakar, has reacted to the dethronement of Muhammadu Sansui as Emir of Kano by the state government. Abubakar disclosed that he’s not sure of President Muhammadu Buhari’s involvement in the dethronement of Sanusi as Emir of Kano. Recall that the Governor Abdullahi Ganduje-led state government had on Monday deposed Sanusi over his alleged disregard for lawful authorities. The government had immediately named one of the sons of late Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, Aminu Ado Bayero the 15th Fulani Emir of the state, following Sanusi’s dethronement. However, Abubakar expressed displeasure over the dethronement of the former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN. Abubakar, who was the chairman of the reconciliation committee set up by the presidency to intervene and find a solution to the misunderstanding between the deposed Emir and Ganduje spoke in an interview with Voice of America Hausa Service. He lamented that the effort of the committee was wasted, following the dethronement of Sanusi. According to Abdulsalmi: “After the conclusion of the assignment, we realized that there was an amicable resolution to the crisis. Surprisingly, this is what happened at last. “Well, I can say so in view of the latest development. In my view, all the committee’s efforts are wasted. “I can’t really say whether Buhari has a hand in the matter because I am currently not in Nigeria. But before I left the country, we submitted our report to him, and he expressed willingness to intervene in the matter in order to have an amicable resolution, despite being a constitutional matter. I really don’t know if he had intervened.” Abdulsalami Abubakar’s position is coming at a time when former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso alleged that Buhari was behind the dethronement of Sanusi.

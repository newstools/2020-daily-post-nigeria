Former Manchester United star, Rio Ferdinand, has criticised Liverpool goalkeeper, Adrian for his error during the Reds’ UEFA Champions League round of 16 second-leg 3-2 defeat against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night. Adrian’s error came when Jurgen Klopp’s side were leading 2-1 on aggregate after two goals from Georginio Wijnaldum and Roberto Firmino. The shot-stopper’s poor kick out from the back gave Diego Simeone’s men an away goal, thanks to Marcos Llorente’s strike before a late Alvaro Morata clincher to give the La Liga giants a 4-2 aggregate victory. But Ferdinand believes the Reds were punished because they do not have a top-class goalkeeper. “It’s gone back to what we spoke about with Liverpool maybe 18 months ago, two years,” Ferdinand told BT Sport. “If you have not got a top-class goalkeeper, you get punished at the highest level. “It just was not to be for Liverpool, they had the chance, and they controlled the game. Liverpool’s fitness levels, to do what they have done for this game, they are out of this world.” Liverpool’s next fixture is against Everton in the Premier League on March 16.

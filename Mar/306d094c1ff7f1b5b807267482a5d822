John Obi Mikel has finally spoken, since his contract with Trabzonspor was terminated by mutual consent. Mikel Obi signed for the Turkish club last summer as a free agent on a two-year deal. However, last week, the former Super Eagles captain spoke out against Turkish football authorities, for allowing the Super Lig season continue despite the spread of the coronavirus across Europe. The midfielder then refused to come off the bench during their 1-1 draw with Istanbul Basaksehir. Yesterday, Trabzonspor confirmed that Mikel Obi has left the club and given up his wages. Reacting in an Instagram post on Wednesday, he wrote: “I would like to thank all the fans for their support. “I also want to say thanks to all my teammates, technical crew, medical team and kit men Ayatabe for all we’ve achieved this season so far, wish you guys best of luck in winning the league. “It was one of the hardest decisions I’ve had to make, but in current situation we all need take care of our families, spend time with them and protect them.”

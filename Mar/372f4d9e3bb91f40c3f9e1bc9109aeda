The Islamic Movement in Nigeria, IMN, otherwise known as Shiites has cried out over the life of their leader, Sheikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky and his wife, following the increasing cases of Coronavirus in Kaduna State. In a statement signed by Ibrahim Musa, IMN’s Media Forum President and made available to DAILY POST on Tuesday, the group also said it has received credible reports that there was shooting around the Kaduna Correctional Center, where their leader is being kept. The statement said it is the responsibility of Federal and State governments, to protect all inmates in such homes, especially with the outbreak of the COVID-19 ravaging the world. IMN said it would hold the federal government responsible for any harm to their leader and his wife. “Credible reports emanating from the Kaduna Correctional Center, where the government is wrongly detaining Sheikh El-Zakzaky and his wife have reached the Islamic Movement in Nigeria of a turmoil leading to gunshots and blocking of all access roads to the Center. “We are rightly concerned about these developments, and we strongly call on all relevant authorities to ensure that the security and safety of the Sheikh and his wife are guaranteed. “We would hold the federal government responsible for any harm to them. It is the responsibility of governments to protect all inmates in such homes, especially with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging the world, especially as the law presumes all to be innocent until proven otherwise by a law court. “The case of Sheikh Zakzaky in particular, is quite different, where a Federal High Court had declared his arrest and detention as unconstitutional and a violation of his fundamental rights. Furthermore, the charges for which he is standing trial at the moment have been punctured by two different courts, who tried nearly 200 members on the same charges, discharged and acquitted them all. “We, therefore, strongly demand for the immediate release of the Sheikh and his wife.”

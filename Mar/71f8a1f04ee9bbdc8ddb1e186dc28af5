Juventus manager, Maurizio Sarri, has urged the club to give Cristiano Ronaldo a suitable gift, when they play Inter Milan on Sunday. Ronaldo made his 1,000th appearance for club and country during the 2-1 win at SPAL last month. The visit of Inter, will be the Portugese superstar’s first game at the Allianz Arena, since he hit the milestone. And Sarri wants Juve to mark the occasion in style for the 35-year-old. “He is an active player, and so not much thinking is needed,” Sarri told the club’s website. “This is a great achievement, but he must immediately chase after new goals. But we know Cristiano and we know that he will be like that. It is a cue for his team-mates to give him a gift.”

Ebonyi Governor, Dave Umahi, says states in the South-East zone were yet to record any confirmed case of coronavirus. He said that was the reason religious centres were not shut initially. Umahi, Chairman of the South-East Governors Forum, spoke to the media on Tuesday in Abakaliki. He said that his administration had put in a number of measures aimed at ensuring that the virus was prevented and contained. “For now, there is no confirmed report of COVID-19 case in Ebonyi and any state of the South-East. However, our government has put in place a number of measures to protect the people”, NAN quoted him as saying. “These include shutting down of schools, night clubs, ban on sporting activities, wedding receptions, burial ceremonies and any social gathering with more than 50 persons. “We have not shut down religious and worship centres, because we have not had any confirmed report of the virus in any part of the South-East.” He added that from March 25, it shall be an offence for gathering of persons other than essential service centres, including markets, rice meals, religious centres, banks and hotels. Umahi added that those listed must ensure the provision of face masks, running water, hand sanitizers and must ensure that people entering and coming out wash their hands to protect them. “Churches and religious centres must observe all health precautions to protect their members and the general public,” Umahi said. The governor added that henceforth, the state would record all passengers entering from some parts of the country.

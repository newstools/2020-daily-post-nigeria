The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it would respect court order on the suspension of its National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. Acting National Secretary, Victor Giadom, said this on Wednesday. He announced the decision of the party while speaking to newsmen on the court ruling Justice Danlami Senchi of FCT High Court gave the ruling in an application of interlocutory injunction following his suspension as a member of the APC from Etsako Ward 10 in Edo State. The application was filed by Mustapha Salihu and five others through their counsel, Oluwole Afolabi. The plaintiffs, in their application dated and filed on January 16, contended that Oshiomhole is currently suspended by the party and has not challenged same. They said Oshiomhole’s rights as a member is abated and cannot continue to act as chairman of the party. A senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Damian Dodo, represented Oshiomhole and the APC, the second defendant. Justice Senchi held that the first and second respondent wrongfully kept Oshiomhole as the APC National Chairman. The judge asked the APC to desist from acknowledging him as the party’s leader. The court further ordered APC not to grant Oshiomole access to the party Secretariat. Justice Senchi said that political parties must be bound by their constitution and that since Oshiomhole failed to challenge his suspension, he should stop parading himself as APC National Chairman. He adjourned hearing to April 7 and 8, 2020.

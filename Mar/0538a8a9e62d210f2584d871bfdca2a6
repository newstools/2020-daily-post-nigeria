Turkey on Sunday announced the start of a military operation against the Syrian regime. The regime is strongly backed by Russian backed and Turkey said it did not wish to clash with Moscow. There is renewed tension in Syria’s northwestern Idlib region following the killing of thirty-three Turkish troops on Thursday. The soldiers died in an attack by the Syrian government forces. “Following the heinous attack on February 27 in Idlib, operation ‘Spring Shield’ successfully continues,” State news agency, Anadolu quoted Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar as saying. “We don’t have the desire or intention to clash with Russia,” the minister added. Russia and Syria were criticised by western countries in the UN Security Council over soldiers’ death. At the UN Council emergency meeting in New York on Friday, the United Kingdom, United States, France, Germany, Belgium and Estonia condemned the attack. But Russia and Syria claimed that the troops were killed outside the observation post they should have been.

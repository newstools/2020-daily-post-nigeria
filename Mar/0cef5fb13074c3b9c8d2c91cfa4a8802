Reigning WBC heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury, has thrown a major dig at British fighter, Anthony Joshua, over unification fight. DAILY POST recalls that boxing promoter Eddie Hearn said Joshua asked him to come to terms with fellow countryman, Tyson Fury, over a unification fight after 31-year-old defeated American boxer, Deontay Wilder last month. Fury said Joshua, who holds the other three major belts in the division, is not a real champion. Asked about taking on Joshua to become the undisputed champion, Fury said on ITV’s This Morning: “I have already been the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world when I beat Klitschko. “I had all the belts. So Anthony Joshua has only got my leftovers because I never lost those belts. “I had to vacate them for mental health problems to focus on myself. “Joshua’s belts belong to me.”

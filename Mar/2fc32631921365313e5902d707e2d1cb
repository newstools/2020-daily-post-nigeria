LaLiga president, Javier Tebas, has predicted that all European football leagues this season, including the Spanish top-flight league, English Premier League (EPL), Serie A, Bundesliga and Ligue 1 will be back by the middle of May. DAILY POST recalls that all the major leagues in Europe, including the Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1 are on hold until April ending due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the continent. But Tebas believes it will take a little longer before the current campaign resumes across Europe. “In mid-May, we should be able to be back on with all European competitions,” Tebas told Marca. “All of them. Of course, it depends on how the pandemic evolves. “It could be before, but that is the date we have got in mind about being able to resume.”

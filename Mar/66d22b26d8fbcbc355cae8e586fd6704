Liverpool will be without their first-choice goalkeeper, Alisson Becker in today’s Premier League clash against Bournemouth due to a muscle injury. Becker sustained the injury during Liverpool’s FA Cup defeat against Chelsea in the midweek FA. Providing an update on the Brazilian’s injury, Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp said the shot-stopper will not take part against Bournemouth. “Unfortunately Alisson is out against Bournemouth,” Liverpool’s official website quoted Klopp as saying at his pre-match press conference. “He had a little incident in training before the Chelsea game. “We all thought it was nothing and it was clear he would not play anyway; the plan was that he was on the bench.” The kick-off time for the match is 1: 30 pm.

The Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) has said it aligned itself with the decision by the Lagos State Government to restrict public gatherings, expressing support for precautionary measures put in place against the spread of Coronavirus. “If this government is taking measures for the benefit of the people, I am for it,” PFN National President, Rev. Dr. Felix Omobude, said in a statement made available to DAILY POST on Friday. “The health of Nigerians is paramount to everyone of us and we must endeavour to be supportive of any move in that direction,” he added. He enjoined all Nigerians to tread with caution, observe the necessary protocols as laid out and maintain proper hygiene at all timed The PFN also declared 3 days of prayer and fasting, staring from Monday 23rd to Wednesday 25th March for divine intervention on the Coronavirus pandemic. “Members are enjoined to pray for an end to the spread, healing and recovery for those infected and for inspiration for the experts in the field so that they might be able to find cure and vaccine for the disease,” the statement added. The PFN President also expressed profound sadness at the loss of lives and properties on account of the Gas explosion which rocked a part of Lagos last Sunday. While sympathising with the people and government of Lagos state over the unfortunate incident, the PFN prays for comfort and strength for the bereaved families and speedy recovery for those who sustained one form of injury or the other and those who lost their homes and properties. Omobude called for support from organisations and individuals for the Relief Fund launched by the Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwoolu in aid of the victims of this disaster.

Mesut Ozil’s agent, Erkut Sogut has given his verdict on the Arsenal midfielder leaving the Gunners for European side, Fenerbahce, amid the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe. DAILY POST recalls that Ozil, who is a huge admirer of Fenerbahce, has drawn interest from the Turkish giants in the past few months. The 31-year-old’s current contract at Arsenal will expire in 2021. But Sogut has now refused to rule out Ozil’s move to the Yellow Canaries, noting that in football, anything can happen. He also stated that the former Real Madrid playmaker is presently happy at the Emirates club. “You never know in football, first of all, you can never predict the movement of players,” Sogut told Goal. “I have said it before, and I am repeating it that Ozil is pleased where he is at Arsenal. “Ozil still has a contract to go, and there is no change. “We will see what the future holds when the contract ends, but for now, there is nothing I can say.” Ozil is currently in self-Isolation after the Premier League was suspended due to coronavirus outbreak across Europe.

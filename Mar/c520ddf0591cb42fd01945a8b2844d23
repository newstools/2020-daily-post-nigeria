Lagos Government says the numbers of coronavirus cases in the state might reach 39, 000. It said this was possible if good social distancing was not adhered to by residents. Prof. Akin Abayomi, the State Commissioner for Health, spoke on Friday at a media briefing. “Our Mathematical modeling shows that worst case scenario we might have 39, 000 cases in Lagos State; however, if we practice good social distancing, we can limit that to about 13,000,” he said. He noted that the figure seem alarming, but that it was important to emphasise that instructions must be adhered to. “Social distancing is the key to bring the outbreak under control, because that way, we are not giving the virus the opportunity to spread from person to person,” he said. He said that of the 44 confirmed cases in the state, 70 per cent were male, while 30 per cent were female, adding that 84 per cent of the imported cases were Nigerians. The commissioner explained that seven of the new cases were detected among a 51 crew members of an oil and gas vessel. Abayomi added that a team had been dispatched a team to Seme Border to rescue 16 Nigerian students stranded at the border. “As expected, when we close borders, we see Nigerians fly to neighbouring countries and try to enter through the land border,” he said.

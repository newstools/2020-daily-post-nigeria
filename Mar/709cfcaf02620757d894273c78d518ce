A three-year-old girl has been defiled and inflicted with a 3rd-degree tear by a 25-year-old man. The incident occurred at Jero Bonyo, a community in Girei local government area of Adamawa State, according to a source in the neighbourhood. “It happened in the late hours of Wednesday,” the source told DAILY POST on Friday afternoon, adding that the girl was taken to Specialist Hospital in Jimeta, but later referred to the Federal Medical Centre in Yola Town, both in the Yola capital metropolis. The suspect was said to have lured the baby to his apartment by giving her sweet, and he allegedly sneaked away when the little girl cried out. The girl was said by Friday evening to have been stabilised and given pre-surgery treatment at the FMC. The Information Officer of the hospital, Mohammed Dodo, confirmed the state of the girl but could not say when the main surgery would be done Multiple sources affirmed Friday that the suspected rapist was on the run, with many blaming the parents of the girl for trying to kill the story. The accusation arose from the unwillingness of the parents to speak to newsmen, as those who visited the hospital were rebuffed. In particular, the father who is believed to know the runaway suspect, is accused of shielding him in the fear that prosecuting the case would put the family in undesirable limelight and expose members to shame. The Adamawa State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Suleiman Nguroje, said he had no authoritative comment on the fresh case as it was not reported to the police.

The governor of Ebonyi State, chief David Umahi yesterday applauded American government for sending a medical team, under the aegis of Uplift Help Incorporated which assisted the State in ending Ebola. Umahi made this known while addressing American delegates who paid a courtesy visit to Ebonyi state government at the exco- chambers, Government House Abakaliki, capital of Ebonyi state. The Governor, represented by the deputy governor, Chief Eric Kelechi Igwe, said that many children were affected by Ebola in rural areas but were promptly rescued through the intervention of the said American medical health team. According to him, “we want to thank the America team for the sacrifices they have made, especially in rendering healthcare delivery services to our people. “They have touched and saved many lives. They have given hope to the hopeless. They have done what parents could not do to their children. They have done what communities could not do to their people. “As a state, we do not have all it takes to reward the America team for the sacrifices they have done for our people. “What we know is that the lives of the children that were saved will continue to pray for the American team.” “When Ebola was ravaging Nigeria, this team visited our communities and rendered services to our people. We may not have all the facilities to touch all the citizens of our state but the America team had come to partner Ebonyi state government to ensure that those we didn’t touch are touched,” he added. Earlier in a remark, the leader of the delegation, Sister Kareem Schinider, said they treated over two hundred children who were infected with Ebola virus. “We have treated at least from one hundred to two hundred people. We tried our best to particularly save the lives of the poor children,” she noted.

The House of Representatives has asked the Ministry of Education to convert federal government colleges to isolation centers to be managed by the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The House reached the resolution following the consideration of a motion moved by the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila on behalf of the principal officers of the House. Gbajabiamila in his motion said that “the novelty of the disease combined with its rapid spread has caught the world almost unawares.” He further stated that the “existing healthcare framework and facilities in the country are not sufficiently robust to provide an effective and lifesaving response in the likely event of a large scale outbreak of the Covid 19 disease within our shores.” The house also resolved to urge the Central Bank of Nigeria as part of its Policy Measures in response to Covid – 19 to act urgently to fully fund the establishment and operations of these emergency health centres across the country. Also the Governor and senior management of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are to brief the leadership of the House on the details of the Central Bank’s Policy Measures in Response to the Covid – 19. The House has now adjourned for two weeks after passing Economic stimulus bill.

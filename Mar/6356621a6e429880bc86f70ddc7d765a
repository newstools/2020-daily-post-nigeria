The organizing Secretary of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) in Abia state, Uche Nwosu, has announced his resignation from the party. This was contained in a letter addressed to the State chairman of APGA, Reverend Augustine Ehiemere and made available to DAILY POST on Sunday night. Nwosu also asserted that APGA under the leadership of Ehiemere in Abia, had negated the original ideology which gave birth to the party and also offended the laws that regulates the activities and administrative functions of the party. According to the party chieftain, “After a while, upon assumption of office as the State Organizing Secretary of APGA in Abia, it became clear to me in my opinion- the vantage point into the administrative and management of the party by the key players at the helm of affairs of the party runs contrary to my conscience. “I ventured into Abia politics with the ultimate goal of being a part of the generation that would positively reshape our state, and finally free Abians from subjugation and enslavement. But, it is quite unfortunate, I mistakenly found myself in the midst of those who view the possibility as a mirage and fantasy, and as such the political will, courage and interest to contribute their efforts in fighting the just cause to liberate the state. This informed my decision to voluntarily exit from APGA”. Meanwhile, Ehiemere could not be reached for his response as of the time of filing this report.

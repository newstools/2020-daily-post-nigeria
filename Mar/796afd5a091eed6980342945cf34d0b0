Former Minister of aviation, Osita Chidoka has reacted to reports making the rounds that dethroned Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamoido Sanusi has been moved to Lagos state. On Thursday, a report emerged online that the ex-CBN governor has been moved to Lagos from Awe village, Nasarawa state. But, Chidoka in a post on his Twitter page debunked the reports. The former minister disclosed that he contacted Sanusi and he confirmed that he is still being held illegally in Awe village. He added that no agency is taking responsibility for his arrest. DAILY POST recalls that the Kano state government on Wednesday denied being responsible for the arrest and exile of Sanusi. Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice, Ibrahim Muktar, said the issue of banishment was not part of the decision made. Chidoka on his Twitter page wrote: “Contrary to speculations, Emir Sanusi confirmed to me that he is still in Awe, Nasarawa State. “He is being held unconstitutionally and illegally and no agency of government is taking responsibility for his unlawful arrest. “A track record of violating fundamental rights is upon us.” Meanwhile, leaders and groups, including Femi Falana, Amnesty International among others have condemned the restriction of Sanusi’s movement .

Barcelona are interested in signing Wilfred Ndidi from Leicester City in the summer, according to Don Balon. Quique Setien is looking to strengthen his midfield after this season and has marked Ndidi as one of his options. Ndidi has established himself as one of the top tacklers in the Premier League in the last two seasons. The Super Eagles star is said to be valued at around â‚¬35million and Setien would be ready to sanction a deal at that price. Despite playing from a defensive position, Ndidi has scored twice for Leicester. He has also attracted attention from Arsenal.

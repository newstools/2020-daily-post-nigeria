The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) says the ongoing trial of former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Babachir Lawal, is being frustrated by witnesses from the SGF’s office. Lawal is facing trial alongside six others in an alleged N544million grass-cutting scandal in an FCT High Court, NAN reports. Others indicted are Hamidu Lawal, who is a director of Rholavision Engineering Limited, an employee of the company, Sulaiman Abubakar and the Managing Director of Josmon Technologies Limited, Apeh John Monday. The EFCC counsel, Ofem Uket, protested at the court after leading Aminu Muhammed, a Principal Procurement Officer in the OSGF, in evidence. He said 80 per cent of the witnesses called by the EFCC were from the OSGF and that they were not cooperative. Citing the instance of a witness, Uket told the court: “I called him last week, he said he was in his village. I called him yesterday in the presence of the IPO and he said he was in Bauchi. “The IPO told him that he (IPO) had a tracker which showed that he (witness) was in Abuja. It was then he admitted that he was in Abuja. I only saw him today” Justice Jude Okeke, in his reaction, said the court had nothing to say to the complaints because he (prosecutor) knows what to do in that instance. Justice Okeke adjourned the matter until April 8.

Real Madrid are set to offer their player, Luka Jovic to Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur as the striker ignored Coronavirus (COVID-19) guidelines after flying home to Serbia last week, according to Mirror UK. Jovic was permitted to leave self-isolation to fly home, but Real Madrid was unimpressed to discover he disregarded Serbia’s coronavirus safeguards. Serbia, as a country, has ordered all persons returning from a coronavirus-hit country to self-isolate for up to twenty eight days. However, Jovic was spotted in the streets of Belgrade not long after he arrived from Spain capital Madrid and also made an appearance at his girlfriend’s birthday party. His actions have left Serbian authorities unimpressed. The 22-year-old was forced to apologise for his actions, saying: “I’m so sorry that some people did not do their jobs professionally and did not give me instructions on how to behave regarding isolation. “In Spain, I was allowed to go to the pharmacy and the supermarket, which isn’t the case here.” Jovic, who joined Real Madrid from Frankfurt last summer, has drawn interest from Chelsea and Tottenham in the past.

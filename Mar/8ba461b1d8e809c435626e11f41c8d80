The newly constituted committee on the Prevention and Control of Coronavirus in Imo state has set the record straight that the state has not recorded any case of the pandemic viral disease known as Coronavirus. The Chairman of the Committee, Prof. Maurice Iwu stated this while briefing newsmen Monday at the Imo state government house. Iwu asked that the rumour that the virus has found its way to the state be disregarded in its entirety, appealing to the people of the state to help in disseminating useful information. The Committee, according to him, has been on top gear since its inauguration by the Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma and has done a lot to educate and enlighten the public on the potency of the disease and its mode of transmission. “The public should engage in regular hand washing and also use hand sanitizers where the former is not readily available.” “Because of its contagious nature, people should maintain social distancing to avoid body contacts of person to person.” “Thank God the symptoms are identifiable. All we need to do is to follow the steps.” “Meanwhile, measures have been put in place to tackle the virus head on in case there may be any case soon but we pray there won’t.” To this end, the Committee has resolved to embark on rural campaign against the disease, disclosing that all public schools in the state will be shut down with effect from March, 25 in line with the Governor’s directive. Similarly, he revealed that the Committee is partnering with the state civil service to explore the option of closing the state workforce or not. Dr. Achigbu Kingsley, the Medical Director of Federal Medical Centre FMC, Owerri, who is a member of the Committee said that his management has enhanced the use of chlorinated soap solution for handwashing for unsuspecting visitors. He further disclosed that some isolation facilities have been provided in case of any eventuality.

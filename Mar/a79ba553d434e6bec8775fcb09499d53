Chelsea forward, Willian, has said he is ready to continue playing for the club, even if matches take place after his current contract expires. The Premier League season has been suspended until April 24 at the earliest, due to the outbreak of the coronavirus in the UK. There are however fears it could be delayed even further. This will present a conundrum, as the likes of Willian and a number of other Premier League players’ contracts expire at the end of June. But speaking on a live Facebook chat to Brazilian TV channel Esporte Interativo, Willian said he would be happy to keep playing, even though he would not be contracted to Chelsea. He said: “My contract really ends I think in July. And if I had to play on those dates, in these months, I think it would be no problem for me to end the League in a way which would be loyal to the club, as they always were with me. Regardless of a signed paper. “But it’s clear that this is not a certainty, we don’t know what can happen. But without a doubt, as always, I will always be ready to give the best to my club regardless of my contract situation.”

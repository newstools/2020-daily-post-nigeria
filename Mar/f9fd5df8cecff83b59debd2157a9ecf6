Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said he is “feeling very well” and is on the road to recovery from coronavirus, even as the club cancelled a return to training on Tuesday. Arteta became the first person in the Premier League to test positive on March 12. “I’m very well now, I feel that I have recovered. “It took me three or four days to start feeling much better and with more energy, to leave the symptoms behind and now, the truth is that I feel very well,” Arteta told La Sexta on Spanish TV. Arsenal also released a statement on Monday, confirming they would delay their planned return to training. “As a result of the current situation we are clear it would be inappropriate and irresponsible to ask the players to come back at this time. “Therefore our men’s first team, women and academy players are all remaining at home. Stay at home and save lives,” it read.

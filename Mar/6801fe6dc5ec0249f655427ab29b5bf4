The Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yoruba land, Gani Adams, on Sunday, called on the federal government to investigate the recent explosions in the South-West. Adams, in his reaction to Saturday’s blasts in Akure, Ondo State capital, said Yorubas believe the incidents were “bombs” not “ordinary blasts.” He expressed sadness that the occurrences were recorded at a time when the authorities and Nigerians were battling the Coronavirus outbreak. The Yoruba leader disclosed that information at his disposal suggests that those behind the “bomb blasts” were also targeting other states in the region. “We are not convinced that all these are ordinary blasts, they were bombs. Governors and residents should be more vigilant, he said in a statement. “It is necessary for the federal government to carry out a thorough investigation on these incidents which occurred within three weeks in Lagos, Ekiti and Ondo States.” Commenting on the Lagos blast, Adams observed that from previous instances, pipeline fires usually burn houses “but never uproots houses from the foundation as was witnessed in Abule Ado.” “I was at the scene of the Lagos incident; it was not an ordinary pipeline fire. Also, on the Ondo State incident, we are not satisfied with the explanation and submission of the Commissioner of Police”. Adams further posited that the Ekiti incident was the same pattern and should not be attributed to carelessness or mere blast. He added that his appeal to the federal government for an immediate diligent probe of the unfortunate trend was to forestall further loss of lives and property. The Aare Ona Kakanfo, however, commiserated with the affected states, areas and the people.

The presidency has reacted to Senate’s call that President Muhammadu Buhari should address Nigerians over the scourge of Coronavirus. The lawmakers had charged the president to give an update on what his government was doing to address the issue of Coronavirus. Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Media & Publicity, on Thursday, described the calls as ‘populist advocacies’ and unnecessary. He maintained that the calls were cheap and sensational, adding that this is not a time for cheap politics. “In this regard, populist advocacies such as the one accusing the President of “complacency” simply because he has not made a television address by ranking members of our respected parliament are cheap and sensational. “These are not the times for populism and cheap politics.” He further thanked all those at the forefront of the fight against the deadly disease. While assuring Nigerians that the government was on top of the situation, the presidential aide pleaded with Nigerians not to see this most peculiar of times as one to be politicised or seen as an opportunity to regurgitate grudges against the government or the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC).

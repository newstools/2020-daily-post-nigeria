Sanusi Lamido Sanusi was seen leading those who came to bid him farewell at the airport in prayers. On Monday, Governor Abdullahi Ganduje dethroned Sanusi as the Emir of Kano. The former Central Bank Governor was escorted out of the palace amid heavy security after his removal. Sanusi left Kano state through the Malam Aminu Kano International Airport at exactly 6.40 pm. As he boarded the aircraft chartered by the state government, the deposed monarch paused at the entrance and offered prayers in front of a group of supporters. Sanusi is believed to be in either Abuja or Nasarawa, where he is expected to serve out his exile period. Aminu Ado Bayero has already been named as his replacement and the 15th Emir of the State.

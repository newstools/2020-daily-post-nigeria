President of the Italian Football Federation, Gabriele Gravina, has predicted that the 2019-20 Serie A season could be concluded in August this year following the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the country. DAILY POST recalls that the Serie A has been suspended since March 9 due to the spread of COVID-19 across the world. Players from several Serie A clubs have tested positive for the deadly virus, including Juventus forward, Paulo Dybala. “I don’t give up easily,” Gravina told Radio Marte. “As long as there is a chance, I will keep alive the hope of restarting the championships. “I am aware that it is premature to think about a date, but we must think positively, also for the health of the Italians, and hope that the [coronavirus] situation ends as soon as possible.” “The league could be completed in 45 to 60 days, If we are given the month of July and August, that could be the right period [to finish the 2019/2020 season],” he said. There are 12 matches left to be played before the 2019-20 Serie A season will be concluded. Juventus are presently on top of the league with 63 points from 26 games, while Lazio are second-place with 62 points from the same number of games.

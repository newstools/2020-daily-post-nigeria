An Abuja-based physician, Dr. Mohammed Ahmed Danfulani has stated that chloroquine is a potent drug for coronavirus. Danfulani, a renowned Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT), made the declaration in a chat with PRNigeria on Thursday. He advised the Ministry of Health and other health-related stakeholders to consider and test the efficacy of chloroquine on persons already quarantined at isolation centres. Coronavirus, which has been declared a global pandemic has killed 7,000 people and affected nearly 200 countries. Danfulani, who explained that using chloroquine is safe, said the popular anti-malaria drug does not have adverse side effects. He said: “It is a common knowledge that chloroquine has potent effects not only on malaria parasite but on other viral diseases and illnesses.” Danfulani added that the actual “therapeutic power” of the drug can only be ascertained after it has been tested on COVID19 patients, and yield good result. “It is safe for Nigerian health officials and medical personnel to consider the use of chloroquine on COVID19 suspects. There is nothing wrong or bad in doing. “The patients are not going to lose anything, but may perhaps get better since the drug doesn’t have any known side effects.” The former Chief Medical Director (CMD) of Kubwa General Hospital, agreed that total lockdown of schools, markets and other public places would could retail the exposure. “I am pleased with the preparation against the epidemic at airports, which are the major entry points into the count. “But since not all those who are said to have contacted it in Nigeria flew in by air, then I am a little bit nervous about how we’ll effectively checkmate its rapid spread,” he added.

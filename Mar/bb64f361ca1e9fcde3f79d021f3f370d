Suspected armed bandits, weekend, attacked travellers on the Birnin-Gwari-Kaduna highway killing, kidnapping and injuring travellers. The attacks, DAILY POST learnt, simultaneously took place on Saturday and Sunday evening. A resident of Birni Gwari, Kaduna, whose relative was a victim, Alhaji Usman Abubakar told DAILYPOST Sunday night that some of the kidnapped victims of the Saturday attack were said to be students on their way back to Birnin-Gwari from Kaduna after writing the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME. According to him, one of the victims killed by the bandits was Ibrahim Idris, the driver of a former House of Representatives member, Adamu Shekarau. Mr Idris, it was learnt, boarded the same commercial vehicle with the kidnapped students. Mr Idris’s relative, Abubakar Garba, confirmed the incident to DAILY POST early Monday morning Garba said Idris was returning to Birnin-Gwari from Kaduna when the vehicle was attacked. He said two of the kidnapped students were young men while the third was a young woman. They were all heading to Birnin-Gwari, he said. He said the bandits returned to the highway on Sunday evening at about 4 p.m. and killed three other persons. “An unconfirmed number of people were also kidnapped in the second attack,” he said. When contacted, the Police Public Relations Officer in Kaduna State, Mohammed Jalige, only confirmed the Saturday attack. He, however, said the police were still trying to get the exact figures. “Yes we got the information about the yesterday incident where a driver of a vehicle was shot to death, we are still waiting for the accurate figures of those kidnapped,” Mr Jalige said.

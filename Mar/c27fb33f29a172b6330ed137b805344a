Manchester United has made a transfer decision that is bad news for Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur. According to the Manchester Evening News, the Red Devils have triggered the one-year contract option of midfielder, Nemanja Matic, who has been a transfer target for Tottenham. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side has now tied the 31-year-old for another year until the end of the 2021 season. DAILY POST recalls that Matic has recently been linked with a move to Tottenham.  His current contract at Old Trafford will expire at the end of the season. Matic has played twice under Mourinho at Chelsea and Man United. Speaking on a possible reunion with Mourinho at Tottenham, Matic told Omnisport before the January transfer window opened: “As I know, you never know what’s going to happen in life. “At the moment, I am a Manchester United player and very focused on my job, and in the future, we will see what’s going to happen.”

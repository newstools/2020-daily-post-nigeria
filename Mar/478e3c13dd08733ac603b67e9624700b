The National Examinations Council (NECO) has announced an indefinite postponement of the 2020 National Common Entrance Examination (NCEE) into Federal Unity Colleges. The examination was earlier scheduled to hold on Saturday, 28 March, 2020 but has now been put off following the coronavirus disease outbreak. The NECO management said its decision is in deference to the various measures being put in place by the Federal and State Governments to curtail the potential spread of Coronavirus (COV1D-19). A statement signed by NECOâ€™s Head, Information and Public Relations Azeez Sani, said the exam body regretted any inconveniences the postponement may have caused its Candidates and other Stakeholders. NECO has, however, assured guardians and stakeholders that a new date for the examination will be communicated in due course. Meanwhile, NECO says registration for the examination continues.

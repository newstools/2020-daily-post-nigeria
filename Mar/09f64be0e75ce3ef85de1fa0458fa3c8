A Paraguayan warden, Blas Vera, has provided the latest update on how Brazilian legend, Ronaldinho is doing in prison. DAILY POST recalls that Ronaldinho and his brother Roberto were arrested last Wednesday night for allegedly using false documentation upon their arrival in Paraguayan capital Asuncion. Ronaldinho and Roberto said their reasons for traveling to Paraguay were for business, and the passports were given to them as a gift by a Brazilian businessman, Wilmondes Sousa Liria, who has been jailed. The former 39-year-old and his brother were taken in handcuffs to a courthouse in Paraguay over the weekend. Prosecutors are seeking to extend the detention of the former attacking midfielder and his brother. At the same time, defence lawyer Sergio Queiroz says both Ronaldinho and Roberto should be unfettered because they are not a threat or flight risk. However, Vera has now said that Ronaldinho is doing very well in prison. “In broad terms, Ronaldinho is doing very well,” Vera told Reuters on Monday. “He is in good spirits and always smiling just like you see him on television.” Ronaldinho, a two-times Ballon d’ Or winner, is currently without a Brazilian passport because of an environmental fine he received in 2018. The former Barcelona and AC Milan star retired from active football in 2018.

Justice Mohammed Liman of a Federal High Court in Lagos has ordered the interim forfeiture of N293million, six parcels of land and company shares recovered from Maj. Gen. Emmanuel Atewe (rtd). He was a Commander of the Military Joint Task Force, Operation Pulo Shield, in the Niger Delta. Atewe is being prosecuted by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, alongside Patrick Akpobolokemi, a former Director-General of Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, Kime Enzogu and Josephine Otuaga. They are facing a 22-count charge of conspiracy, stealing and money laundering. The order of interim forfeiture follows an ex-parte application by the EFCC, alleging that the assets were part of proceeds of N8.5billion for the military operation, which he is accused of diverting from the military between September 5, 2014 and May 20, 2015. EFCC counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, argued that it would be in the interest of justice for the court to order the temporary forfeiture of the assets. Justice Liman adjourned until April 20, 2020 for anyone interested in the assets to appear before the court to show reasons why they should not be finally forfeited to the Federal Government. The landed properties were 50 hectares of farmland at Plot No. FL746B Gaube Farmland Extension II Layout, Kuje, Abuja; a piece of land located at Commercial Layout, Yenagoa Gardens, Bayelsa State; one hectare of land in Kuje District, Abuja. Others were Plot No. CP10, Sector Centre B Layout, Kuje, Abuja; Plot MF62 Outer Northern Expressway Cadastral Zone, Abuja; Plot No. 1228 Jahi, Abuja; four hectares of land designated as Plot No. CP6386 and Plot No. CP6387, Sabon Lugbe, Abuja.

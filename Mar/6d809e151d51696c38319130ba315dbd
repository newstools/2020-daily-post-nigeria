The Imo State Police Command has cautioned residents of the state to avoid social gatherings of any kind in line with the federal government’s directive in keeping the deadly coronavirus at bay. In a press release signed by the state command’s Public Relation Officer, Orlando Ikeokwu, citizens are advised to remain indoors until the virus is properly taken control of. The state government, according to the release, has also ordered for the shutdown of major markets in the state with effect from Saturday 28, 2020, and therefore advised that the citizenry adhere strictly to directive for the good of all. The command, however, assured the people of the state of its renewed efforts in providing safety and security to all even in the wake of the COVID-19 scourge.

The Sultan of Sokoto, Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar says hunger is a deadlier disease killing Nigerians than the dreaded Coronavirus. Abubakar stressed that what a lot of Nigerians are facing in terms of hunger and other challenges was much more than Coronavirus. He said this yesterday at the first quarterly meeting of Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) in Abuja. The Sultan urged the Federal Government to put in place measures that would address the challenges facing Nigerians. He urged the Federal Government to put in place policies and structures that will alleviate the sufferings of Nigerians. According to Abubakar: “There is a very serious virus that is killing Nigerians much higher than Coronavirus. That virus is hunger. “There is hunger virus and it’s very serious. You need to go round the country, into the villages, into the towns and see how people are really struggling to survive. “These are very serious issues and as religious and community leaders, we must continue to talk about these issues and also send our recommendations to the government and watch how the government will implement the recommendations.” Recall that the Nigerian government had recently confirmed an index case in the country.

The presiding Pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa on Friday charged Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State to stop selling Coronavirus kits to people of the state. Giwa gave the charge in reaction to alleged report that Akeredolu was selling kits, an action he described as inhumane and ridiculous. In a statement signed and forwarded to DAILY POST, Giwa specifically claimed he “personally bought the kits for his people.” “Either the governor knows or he doesn’t know anything about this inhuman treatment, I am using this medium to beg him to stop selling these material kits to the people of Ondo State. “I personally gave out some money to go purchase these materials. Can you imagine that the face mask kits are being sold for N7,000 per pack? “Hand gloves and others are being sold at high prices, and this is ridiculous. Do they consider those who don’t have money to buy these kits at all? “Now tell me how they are preparing to protect the people? Health officials are even selling these kits to the people inside the state hospital in Akure. “What they are now doing is to disburse these materials to some stores around the hospital for cover up. “We must consider the hard times people are going through; anybody, either religious leaders or politicians trying to extort money from the people to face the wrath of God. “Hunger kills faster than any disease, and we must find a way to help the poor instead of inflicting pain on them. “If they want to share money during elections, they surely know how they go about it. Let them use the same way to give these people materials for free. “I call on Governor Akeredolu to make these material kits available for the people of Ondo State. This is the time for him to show that he really loves and cares for his people.” Since the first index case of Coronavirus in Nigeria, the toll of confirmed cases has risen to 65. This followed 14 fresh confirmed cases across the country yesterday.

Archbishop of Canterbury, Archibishop Justin Welby has urged former President, Olusegun Obasanjo, to continue his efforts on global peace. He said this in a letter to Obasanjo who clocks 83 on March 5. The letter was presented by Bishop Precious Omuku at the Penthouse of the Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) Abeokuta, Ogun State. Welby is the Senior Bishop of the Church of England, the symbolic head of the worldwide Anglican Communion and the Diocesan Bishop of the Diocese of Canterbury. The letter noted that despite Obasanjo’s age, he has continued to serve the course of peace globally. It reads: “I write to wish you many happy returns of the day on 5th March. At an age when many retire, you continue to serve the course of peace across the world, and especially in Africa. “May God grant you blessing, wisdom, the assurance of salvation and confidence in His love for you in Cross and Resurrection in the peace of Christ.” Responding, Obasanjo who described the letter as “a special birthday gift”, admitted that the request to continue to serve for peace was a challenge. “It is a challenge to do more than what we have done. You realise that everywhere we are, there is always an opportunity to work for peace and an opportunity to work for justice, which is foundation for peace. “There is plenty of work to do. My prayer is that God will give us the wherewithal to do more,” Obasanjo said. The former leader commended the Director of the Centre for Human Security and Dialogue (CHS&D), Prof. Peter Okebukola, for organizing “this surprise occasion. “Every birthday is a special day, but this particular one is particularly special. I thanked Archbishop and the initiator of this surprise occasion, Prof. Okebukola”, he said.

The Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, has called on governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, to shut down their States. The Coalition said after a detailed review of the growing threat of the fast spreading and deadly Coronavirus, it have resolved to advise all state governors to adopt a 14 days temporarily shut down, movement restriction and seat at home measures like the one announced by the Rivers Governor, Gov. Wike. Governor Wike had on Wednesday shut down all borders going into the State. The Coalition said this will serve as a proactive and emergency offensive to help halt the virus from spreading nationwide and turning into a national calamity. “In furtherance of the above, we wish to direct our governors to immediately shut down their land/sea borders to stop inter state movement, close down their airspace working with the Federal Government especially FAAN and stop all public gatherings, burials, close down motor parks, cinemas etc and impose a 14 days stay at home during which those already with the virus will manifest and be isolated and treated thereby wiping the virus,” CUPP said in a statement made available on Wednesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere. “We also appeal to citizens that will be affected and Federal Government to work with the states to enforce these painful yet effective measures as a last effort to deal a fatal blow of this virus.”

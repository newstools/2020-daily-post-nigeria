The Enugu State Ministry of Health has debunked rumours that the two cases in the state that tested positive for Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Hon. Geoffrey Onyeama and his Personal Assistant. DAILY POST recalls that the Enugu State government had confirmed two coronavirus cases in the State. But few hours after, rumours took over the State that Onyeama and his personal aide were the two coronavirus patients. However, in a statement by the Permanent Secretary, State Ministry of Health, Dr. Ifeanyi Agujiobi, the state government said the claims were untrue, fictitious and baseless as well as the handiwork of mischief makers who want to dent the image of the Minister. Dr. Agujiobi maintained that the two positive cases of COVID-19 were returnees from the United Kingdom (UK) and were currently in Isolation and doing very well. According to Agujiobi, “Suffice it to say that Geoffrey Onyeama and his Personal Assistant are not the two cases of COVID-19, recently reported in Enugu. “We hereby enjoin the general public to disregard any information on COVID-19 in Enugu State that does not emanate from the state government through the State Ministry of Health or Information. Let us be well guided.”

Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane has said that his side’s biggest problem after their 2-1 defeat against Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday was that his players did not have enough of the ball during the encounter. The Frenchman, who takes full responsibility for the Los Blancos’ defeat against Betis, also said that his players did not show enough energy against the host. Zidane’s men were defeated at the Benito Villamarin Stadium after two goals from Sidnei, and Cristian Tello as Karim Benzema’s penalty was not enough to give the Los Blancos a point. “We did not have enough of the ball, which is not usually the case for us, and that was our biggest problem, Zidane was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying at his post-match. “We did not show enough energy to trouble Real Betis. It is not just defensively, we conceded two goals, but that was not the problem in today’s game. “I am more frustrated by how we used the ball, and we struggled against them. “It was a poor performance for us from beginning to end of the match. “It’s a pity because we had a chance to put in an excellent performance, but we didn’t. “It was hard for us, we gave the ball away a lot, and I have no explanation. “I am the person responsible. I am to blame for the result. We are going to analyse what happened, but today, we can’t be happy with our performance”. Real Madrid’s next fixture is against Manchester City in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie on Tuesday at the Etihad Stadium.

The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ, Adewale Giwa, says Nigeria’s multi-language is hindering the country’s progress. Giwa, in a statement on Monday, said the situation had made it difficult for past and present leaders to proffer solutions to the nation’s problems. The cleric noted that those in positions of authority ignored the solutions to the challenges facing Nigeria due to selfishness, egocentrism, and wickedness. He said: “They have turned deaf ears to the cries of Nigerians because of what they are sharing in Abuja. ‘If we cannot speak in one language, it means Nigeria is big for one man to manage. Presently, we have over 530 languages in Nigeria. “An Igbo man does not understand what Yoruba man is saying likewise an Hausa man finds it extremely difficult to understand what Yoruba man is saying. “With this, it will be hard to unite and fight for our dreams. If a president comes from the North, he takes care of his people more than the people who come from other regions. Yoruba man does that, Igbo does that too. “If we could have different churches with different doctrines today, what stops the government from allowing each region to manage its resources?” Giwa pointed out that those countries that are developed attained the status because they communicate in one major. The religious leader cited Germany, Spain and France as instances and added that even God affirmed fact that speaking the same language led to unity. Quoting from Genesis 11 in the Bible, he recalled that during “the buildings of The Tower of Babel, the Scripture says there were speaking in one language.”

The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, on Sunday condemned the tradition of dethroning and banishing Emirs in Northern Nigeria. AYCF President General, Yerima Shettima described as “stupid and primitive” the tradition of banishing Emirs in the region. He was reacting to the dethronement and banishment of Muhammadu Sanusi as Emir of Kano. Following his dethronement, Sanusi was banished to Awe area of Nasarawa State but was set free by a ruling of an Abuja Federal High Court. However, Shettima while speaking with DAILY POST said the court order was an indication that the tradition has been reviewed. Shettima also expressed hope that the constitution would be amended to create room for such tradition to be abolished. He said: “It has definitely been reviewed with the ruling of the Federal High Court in Abuja, he is a freeman as it is today, so I’m sure the tradition can’t be above the constitution of the land. “I’m sure with time there would be an amendment in the constitution that will take care of this completely, so that nobody would attempt to do that. “It is primitive and stupid for us for to start imagining that the movement of a Nigerian should be restricted, even a foreigner who have some measure of freedom of movement, this is primitive and I’m sure the constitution will take care of that.”

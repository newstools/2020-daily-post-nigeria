The Police have arrested a thirteen-year-old suspect, Precious Life, who allegedly stabbed the son of a Police Sergeant, Marvelous Ekrake to death in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State. The Delta State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Onome Onovwakpoyeya did not pick or return calls put across to her mobile phone. However, the Divisional Police Officer, “A” Division in Ughelli, CSP Kelvin Zuokumor confirmed the arrest of the suspect in a telephone chat with
DAILY POST in Warri, Delta State. CSP Zuokumor said,”The matter is before the Delta State Police Command.” It was learnt that the suspect was arrested with the assistance of his family members who took him to the station. In a chat with newsmen, Life said he had a disagreement with the deceased over the sharing of N300 they were paid for a job. While noting that he had no intention of killing his friend, Life said,”I just wanted to threaten him with the knife”. “After we completed the job for the woman earlier that day, we were paid N300 and Marvellous decided to take N200 which I objected that the money ought to be shared equally. But he insisted, claiming that he would take the larger share because he is older. “Angered by this, I reported the matter to my father who told me to allow him take the money. Later that evening, while he was playing with our toy, I warned him to stop playing with the toy which I collected from him and threw inside my father’s room with a warning that I will stab him if he goes into the room to take it. “Despite my warning, Marvellous insisted that he will go into my father’s room to collect the toy which he did, and it was in that process that he was stabbed. And I ran away. I didn’t know that he would die, I did not know how the whole incident happened.” It would be recalled that Life stabbed his friend to death last Saturday at the police quarters behind the Ughelli INEC office in Ughelli and ran way.

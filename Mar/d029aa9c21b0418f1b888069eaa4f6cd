President Muhammadu Buhari has been accused of deliberately risking the health of Nigerians after his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari tested positive to COVID-19. DAILY POST reported on Tuesday that the Chief of Staff to the President, who recently returned from Germany, has now tested positive to Coronavirus. Also, one of the President’s daughters, is on self-isolation after she returned from the UK late last week. Reno Omokri, a former aide to President Goodluck Jonathan on New Media, has now accused Buhari of having waited for Abba Kyari and his daughter to return to the country before restricting flights. There are rumours that the dreaded disease has spread fast in the Presidential Villa with the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, confirming the status of Abba Kyari. Omokri tweeted, “Even when @Atiku knew his son was abroad, he called for closing down Nigeria’s borders. That is LEADERSHIP. “General @MBuhari didn’t restrict flights UNTIL his daughter and Abba Kyari returned. He deliberately risked the health of Nigerians to protect his family!”

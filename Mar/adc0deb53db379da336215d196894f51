Former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi has finally departed Awe area of Nasarawa State. Sanusi left his “exile residence” in the same vehicle with the Governor of Kaduna State, Nasir El-Rufai on Friday. Recall that El-Rufai had earlier visited the deposed Emir where they had a closed-door meeting before heading for Jumaat together.  It was however, not clear where Sanusi was headed to as at the time of filing this report Meanwhile an Abuja Federal High Court had earlier granted an interim order releasing Sanusi from detention. Justice Anwuli Chikere granted the order after Sanusi’s lawyer, Lateef Fagbemi argued an ex parte motion.

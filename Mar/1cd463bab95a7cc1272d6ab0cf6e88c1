Femi Fani-Kayode, former Aviation Minister, on Sunday reacted to President Muhammadu Buhari’s planned nationwide broadcast. Fani-Kayode claimed he advised Buhari to address Nigerians on ravaging Coronavirus pandemic. In a tweet, the former minister commended the president for listening to his advice of addressing Nigerians. He tweeted: “I gather that you will be doing a live broadcast at 7.00pm this evening. As I told you before, that is the way to settle this matter. “Thanks for listening & taking my advice. When you speak about the evil plague please do not call it COVIKK 1-9. Call it COVID 19 or CORONAVIRUS!” Buhari’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina had disclosed that the president will address Nigerians via a nationwide broadcast at 7pm today. Adesina, however, did not disclose the nature of the broadcast.

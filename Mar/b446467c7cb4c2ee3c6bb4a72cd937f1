Former Arsenal midfielder Alexander Hleb, has urged Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi and Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, to continue their football careers in the Belarus league due to the coronavirus outbreak in Europe. According to Hleb, both Messi and Ronaldo can follow the example of ice hockey players, who headed to Russia once the NHL stopped. Belarus league is the only country in Europe where football is still going despite the COVID-19 pandemic in the continent. All the major leagues in Europe, including Serie A, Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1, are on hold until April ending due to the coronavirus outbreak in the continent. “All the world now watches the Belarusian league,” Hleb said as quoted by The Sun. “Everybody should watch us on their television. “When the NHL ended the season, most of the ice hockey players went to Russia to play. “Maybe Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo should come to the Belarus league to continue. “It is the only place in Europe you can play football. At least then, the people of Belarus will be happy.” He added: “In Belarus, it is like no one cares. It is incredible. Maybe in one week or two weeks, we will stop playing. “Maybe our president is just waiting to see what happens with the coronavirus. “Everybody in Belarus knows what is happening in Italy and Spain. It doesn’t look right. “But in my country, Belarus, people in the presidential administration believe it’s not as extreme as the news says.”

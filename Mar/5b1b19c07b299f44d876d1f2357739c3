Liverpool boss, Jürgen Klopp, has disclosed that midfielder, Naby Keita, could be available for selection when the Reds face Bournemouth in the Premier League this weekend. Klopp said this ahead of Liverpool’s FA Cup fifth-round clash against Chelsea on Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge. Keita missed Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat against Watford last weekend due to a minor hip injury. The Guinea international will also miss Liverpool’s clash against Frank Lampard’s side tonight. Providing an injury update on Keita, Klopp was quoted by Liverpool’s official website as telling reporters at his pre-match press conference: “A little, little, little bit but enough with his hip. “I can not really say more; that is the only information I got from the medical department. “Keita is not ready against Chelsea but could be ready for Bournemouth clash. “It’s not serious, but obviously serious enough.”

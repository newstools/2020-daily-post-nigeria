Tanko Salihu Yakasai, Special Adviser on Media to Kano Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, has condemned the cartoon depicting the state as a cage. A cartoonist, Mustapha Bulama, on Saturday, posted an image which showed a character of of Ganduje in a cage while pointing at that of the dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II. Sanusi is seen walking away and saying to Ganduje: “You can stay there.” Yakasai described the drawing as a mockery and an insult to the people of Kano. He said the Kano is not a cage and that state with “a thousand year old history and has produced great leaders and scholars” was attacked. Yakasai tweeted: “I see this as a mockery and insult to the entire people of Kano. Kano is NOT a cage, its a state with a thousand year old history, that has engaged in trade an commerce with the entire world for centuries, that has produced great leaders and scholars, Kano will continue to be GREAT ISA.” In his reaction, Bulama tweeted: “It was a cage for the emir”. Sanusi, Friday night, arrived in Lagos where he would be living henceforth. He had been in detention in Awe, Nasarawa State, where he was banished to after his removal. But a High Court freed him after ruling that restriction of his movement was an abuse of his rights.

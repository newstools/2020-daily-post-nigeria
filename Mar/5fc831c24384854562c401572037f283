Femi Fani-Kayode, a social commentator and Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, chieftain, has reacted to the death of the suspected COVID-19 patient in Enugu State . DAILY POST reported that the result of the suspected coronavirus patient in Enugu State,him however, returned negative. The female patient, who returned from the United Kingdom, was isolated after she presented with suspected symptoms. Her samples were then collected and sent to Edo State for test. However, the state Ministry of Health said the woman tested negative. She died on Wednesday as a consequence of an illness not related to Coronavirus. Fani-Kayode expressed sadness over the woman’s death and berated her daughter for blaming the government for her death. “Sad that the lady that tested negative to COVID19 in Enugu has died as a consequence of an unrelated illness,” the former Aviation Minister tweeted. “Even sadder is the ludicrous claim by her ‘daughter’ that the Enugu State Govt is responsible for her death because they kept her in isolation. This is malicious rubbish!”

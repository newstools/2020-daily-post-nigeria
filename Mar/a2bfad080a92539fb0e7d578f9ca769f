Two-times Ballon d’ Or winner, Ronaldinho was in court on Saturday facing trial in Paraguay for allegedly using a fake passport to enter the South American nation, according to Sky Sports. DAILY POST recalls that the Brazilian legend was arrested along with his brother Roberto by the Paraguay police last Wednesday night for alleged falsification of documentation. Ronaldinho and Roberto were taken in handcuffs to a courthouse in Paraguay on Saturday. Prosecutors are seeking to extend the detention of the former Barcelona attacking midfielder and his brother. At the same time, defence lawyer Sergio Queiroz says both Ronaldinho and Roberto should be unfettered because they are not a threat or flight risk. Ronaldinho and his brother said the documents were offered as a gift by a Brazilian businessman, Wilmondes Sousa Liria, who has been jailed, and their reasons for traveling to Paraguay was for business. The 39-year-old is currently without a Brazilian passport because of an environmental fine he received in 2018. The former Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan star officially announced his retirement from football in 2018. The 2002 World Cup winner won many honours during his glittering career with Fluminense, Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan including a World Cup with Brazil in 2002, the Ballon d’Or in 2005, and the Champions League with Barcelona in 2005-06. Ronaldinho was appointed as Brazil’s new ambassador for tourism in 2019.

Trabzonspor midfielder, John Obi Mikel, was an unused substitute as his team drew 1-1 with Istanbul Basaksehir at the Medical Park Stadyumu (Trabzon) on Sunday. Mundo Deportivo reports that Mikel Obi did not feature, because he refused to enter the pitch. Before the game, the former Super Eagles captain, expressed his concern over the match being allowed to go on, amid the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the world. “There is more to life than football. I do not feel comfortable and don’t want to play football in this situation,” he wrote. Before last weekend’s match, Mikel Obi started 12 of the last 13 league fixtures for Trabzonspor. His manager, Huseyin Cimsir, speaking at a press conference after the Istanbul Basaksehir draw, stated that he respects the player’s decision.

Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, says the Chinese man who arrived in Lagos, aboard an Ethiopian Airline with cough, on March 2, has tested negative for coronavirus. Abayomi confirmed this via his Twitter handle @ProfAkinAbayomi on Tuesday evening. He said that the Chinese had exhibited symptoms of the virus and was isolated at the airport. The commissioner disclosed that samples collected from him and tested at the Biosecurity laboratory came out negative.

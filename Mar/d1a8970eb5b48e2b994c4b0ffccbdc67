The Premier League have suggested next Wednesday, as the new date for Manchester City vs Arsenal, the UK Mirror reports. The Gunners were due to play at the Etihad last Sunday, but it was postponed because of the Carabao Cup final. League officials are now looking at next week, as both clubs have a free midweek. It would be Mikel Artetaâ€™s first return to City after he left to take over at the Emirates in December. A decision on the new date is expected in the next 24 hours, with City keen to avoid a fixture pile-up at the end of the season Arsenal play West Ham on Saturday, while City are away at rivals Manchester United on Sunday.

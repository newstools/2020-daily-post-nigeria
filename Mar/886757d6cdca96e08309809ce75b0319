Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said that his team was defeated 3-2 by Wolves in the Premier League on Sunday because his players were not aggressive during the encounter against the visitors. According to Mourinho, Nuno Espírito Santo’s men were so powerful on the counter attack against Spurs, adding that the result was totally unfair. Wolves defeated Mourinho’s men at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, thanks to three goals from Matt Doherty, Diogo Jota and Raul Jimenez. Steven Bergwijn and Serge Aurier did score for Tottenham. “We do not have that aggression against Wolves,” Mourinho was quoted by Football London as saying at his post-match press conference. “That was maybe the only difference between the both teams today. “I do not believe it was a fair result. Both teams wanted to win and played different styles. “But they were so powerful on the counter attack. “We tried different solutions. It worked in a way because we scored two goals. I feel it is unfair, the result, totally unfair.” Tottenham’s next Premier League clash is against Burnley on March 7.

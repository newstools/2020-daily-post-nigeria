Prosecutors will focus on what they believe is a money laundering scheme, involving Brazil football legend Ronaldinho and the businesswoman who invited him to Paraguay. Investigators will review files and messages on phones belonging to Ronaldinho and his brother and business manager, Roberto Assis. The lead prosecutor in the case, Osmar Legal, told Reuters he is investigating the link between the brothers and Dalia Lopez. Lopez, who is a businesswoman, arranged their visit and who met them on arrival at the airport in Asuncion before they were detained. “She could be involved in a money laundering scheme and that means we have to investigate all the other people that were related to that kind of crime, including Ronaldinho,” Legal said. “That is why we strictly maintain that he be kept in jail. “Our principal hypothesis is that they produced false documents, that they used those documents [to enter Paraguay] and that they were eventually going to be used for some commercial means or investments that were not legal.” Ronaldinho was arrested with his brother on March 6, after attempting to enter Paraguay with a fake passport. A judge denied them bail or refused to release into house arrest, saying they posed a flight risk.

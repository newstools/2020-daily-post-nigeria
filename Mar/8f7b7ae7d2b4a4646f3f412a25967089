The World Boxing Council (WBC) has published the drug test results for Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder, after their fight last month. The tests were carried out by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association [VADA]. Fury produced an impressive performance to defeat Wilder by TKO in the seventh round and claim the WBC heavyweight title. WBC has now confirmed in a statement that both fighters passed all their tests. It reads: “World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Tyson Fury, and Deontay Wilder, came out clean in the doping tests conducted by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association as part of the successful Clean Boxing Program. “We want to thank both warriors and their respective teams for their willingness to sign up for the Clean Boxing Program and demonstrate that they are both exemplary athletes, who testify to their honesty and commitment to boxing.” Fury will now face Wilder in a trilogy fight in July, after the Bronze Bomber activated the rematch option.

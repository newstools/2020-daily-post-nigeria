Kano State Government has stated that it did not banish the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II after his dethronement. Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice, Ibrahim Muktar, spoke on Channels Television on Wednesday. Muktar’s claim is a clear contrast to that of the earlier comment by Salihu Tanko Yakasai, media aide to Governor Umar Ganduje. The AG said when the Secretary to the State Government addressed the press on Sanusi’s removal, “there was nowhere he said the emir was even banished from Kano State”. “The decision of the government was (that) the emir as of Monday was removed from office and a new emir was appointed. “The issue of banishment was not part of the decision of the Kano State Government.” The denial came amid nationwide condemnation of the deposed Emir’s treatment. Many are wondering why Sanusi was moved to Nasarawa allegedly on the order of Kano government. Opinion leaders and groups, including Femi Falana, Amnesty International among others have condemned the restriction of Sanusi’s movement.

The Supreme Court has suspended proceedings on the review of its judgement which sacked Emeka Ihedioha as Governor of Imo State. The apex court suspended proceedings after taking arguments from parties on the application by Ihedioha. Ihedioha in his application is contesting the declaration of Hope Uzodinma as governor of Imo State after he was sacked. However, a seven-man panel of the apex court, led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Ibrahim Muhammad disclosed the suspension of proceedings. The CJN announced that the court will return later to take its final decision on the matter

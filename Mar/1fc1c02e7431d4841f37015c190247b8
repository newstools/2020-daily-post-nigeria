Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud, has said that he was blocked from joining Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur during the last January transfer window. Giroud was expected to leave Chelsea in the January transfer window after finding himself behind Tammy Abraham and Michy Batshuayi in manager, Frank Lampard’s pecking order. Tottenham, Inter Milan, and Lazio were among the clubs that wanted to sign the France World Cup winner. “The most interesting for me was Inter Milan,” Giroud told Telefoot. “The problem was that it dragged on. Lazio and Tottenham were there too, but I was blocked.” Giroud added: “I knew I should not go on strike, or go to sulk in the locker room. “Because it was not me, and because I knew there was a good chance I would stay at Chelsea.” Giroud’s current contract at Chelsea will expire at the end of the season.

Giving the order in Akure, the Ondo State capital on Tuesday evening, the governor said that the committee on sanitation and traffic rules has been mandated to carry out the exercise. While stressing that the exercise will kick start on Tuesday, Akeredolu said, “We have given additional responsibility to the committee on sanitation and traffic rules to disinfect and fumigate our markets, streets and motor parks. “The state government has purchased motorised water pumps; we have 50 drums of ethanol, chlorine that would be used for this exercise. “We have equally bought water takers and Hilux vans that would carry the water tankers to the markets and motor parks. “By the time our market returned after the closure they will meet cleaner market that had been fumigated.” Responding, the Chairman of the committee who is the state commissioner for Water Resources Mrs. Yetunde Adeyanju said that the governor’s directive will be followed to the letter. Adeyanju pointed out that the exercise would take place across the markets in towns and motor parks across the state.

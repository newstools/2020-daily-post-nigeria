The United States has invited medical professionals to apply for visa amid the increasing number of coronavirus cases. America has overtaken the number of confirmed cases worldwide and is scrambling to contain the spread. Most parts of the country are on a two-week lockdown. U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs, via its Twitter account, advised health personnel to contact their nearest Embassy for visa appointment. “We encourage medical professionals seeking work in the U.S. on a work or exchange visitor visa (H or J), particularly those working on #COVID19 issues, to contact the nearest U.S. Embassy/Consulate for a visa appointment”, it tweeted. There are nearly 90,000 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus in the U.S. The figure supersedes that of China, where the virus originated, as well as Italy, the worst hit country in Europe. Numbers of infections in the two countries are just over 80,000 cases each. Meanwhile President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping have discussed the global pandemic in a phone call. Coronavirus has caused 25,000 deaths and affected 200 countries.

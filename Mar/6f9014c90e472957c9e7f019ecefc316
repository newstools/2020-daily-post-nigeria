President Muhammadu Buhari has reacted to the death of Evelyn, 67-year-old wife of former Senator representing Bayelsa East senatorial district, Ben Muray-Bruce. Bruce, who left the National Assembly ahead of the 2019 general elections, shared the sad news of his wife’s death via his Twitter page on Friday. “ I’m broken. Just lost my beautiful wife to cancer. She was my best friend for 43 years and my wife for 41 years. “Cancer is real, but it shouldn’t be a death sentence – awareness, and early detection and treatment are key to survival. “I miss her so so much. I’m broken,” the former lawmaker and owner of Silverbird Group, tweeted. Reacting in a statement signed and made available to DAILY POST on Friday, by his Spokesman, Femi Adesina, Buhari said he “shares heartfelt sorrow with Senator Ben Murray-Bruce on the loss of his wife of 41 years, Evelyn.”
The statement added that the President prays for God to comfort the Senator, who represented Bayelsa East in the 8th Assembly, the children left by the deceased, and the entire family. He urged them to take solace in the quality of life lived by the departed, while beseeching God to “soothe their pains, and grant succour to all those who mourn Mrs Evelyn Murray-Bruce.”

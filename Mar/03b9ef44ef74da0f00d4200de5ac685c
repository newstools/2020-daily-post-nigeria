The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Ekiti State chapter, yesterday directed its members across its 17 jurisdictional centres of the state to comply with the restriction of the number of congregation to 20. The religious organization averred that the executive order issued by Governor Kayode Fayemi, was targeted at checkmating Coronavirus and to safeguard the state against attack by this ravaging plague. As part of the measures to contain the spread of the disease, Governor Fayemi had last week Friday directed all churches and mosques to restrict their congregations to 20, which was accorded partial compliance across the state at worship centres. Speaking with journalists via telephone, on Thursday, in Ado Ekiti , the CAN Chairman in Ekiti, Reverend Peter Olowolafe , urged Nigerians to be hopeful in spite of the seeming gloomy position of the economy caused by Coronavirus pandemic . He said he had ordered the CAN leaderships across the 17 jurisdictions in the state to enforce the governor’s directive. “It was an instruction from government, and we have to abide by it. We held a meeting with government on Monday on the situation and after we deliberated on the issue, I sent messages to our leaders to give effect to this order. “I had told them to make sure they get to all the towns under their jurisdictions, because the message is for the benefit of all of us. “I am hopeful that every of our member will comply, but there will be compliance with what we have put in place. “We have asked them to split their services rather than having a huge crowd in an attempt to conduct one service”. Olowolafe urged Nigerians to be prayerful to be able to overcome the current challenges that is gradually paralysing the economy. “We shouldn’t lose hope and our people must abide by all precautionary measures stipulated as guidelines for personal hygiene by the federal and state governments”, he advised.

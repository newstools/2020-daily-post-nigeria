Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, has disclosed that he tested negative for Coronavirus (COVID–19). The billionaire disclosed this on his verified Twitter handle on Sunday. The post reads: “The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted modern society, affecting our collective health and well-being. “As a global citizen and business leader, I took the COVID-19 test and the result came back NEGATIVE.” Dangote further announced that he is leading a Coalition Against COVID-19 with other private sector leaders to support Government initiatives in the fight against COVID-19. “We are in this together, and I am optimistic we will overcome,” he added. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, on Saturday confirmed eight new cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria; 2 in FCT, 4 in Oyo, 1 in Kaduna and 1 in Osun State respectively. That brings the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nigeria to 97 as government continues the fight to curb the spread.

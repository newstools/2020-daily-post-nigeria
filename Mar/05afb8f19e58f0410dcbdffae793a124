Senior Pastor, Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has urged Governor Rotimi Akeredolu to make Coronavirus material kits available for the people of Ondo State. Giwa made the call in a statement he signed and made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday, describing the current outbreak pandemic as the most unfortunate disaster in years He said Akeredolu was not doing enough to protect the lives of the people of Ondo State, lamenting that the disease was a “demon ” that had affected the global health. “This has never happened in history, and that is why we must do everything to protect the lives of the good people of Nigeria,” the pastor added. According to him, this is one of the things that Jesus told his followers to be expecting in Matthew 24, insisting that it is one of the devil’s battles before Jesus Christ appears. “The disease that could have made the world shut down churches, schools among others would tell you that it is not ordinary anymore. “We need to pray fervently against this demon, called Coronavirus. “Permit me to say that Governor Akeredolu is not doing enough to protect the people. Our people are lamenting that there are no material kits. “This goes beyond shutting down markets, schools and churches. We cannot just be copying what others are doing without helping the people. “What stops the governor from spending his security vote? This is the time to make use of it to save the lives of the people. “They know how they do it whenever they want people to vote for them. They know how they give money to the voters. “Let them use the same strategy to help the people survive this hard times.”

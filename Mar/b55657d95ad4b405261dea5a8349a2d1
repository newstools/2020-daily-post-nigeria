Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said that he needs “two or three” new signings, to fight for the Premier League title. Solskjaer was speaking after United completed a league double over champions Manchester City for the first time in 10 years. Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay scored for the Red Devils, as they won 2-0 at Old Trafford on Sunday. Although Solskjaer was impressed with the “complete” performance, he feels the squad needs more additions. “We feel we are improving all the time. We know we lack one two three players to be considered a title contender and some experience and we know that. “We are just going to start talking about going up the table, getting more points. “Chelsea and Leicester are too far ahead for my liking,” Solskjaer said at his post-match conference.

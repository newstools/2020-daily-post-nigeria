President Muhammadu Buhari’s spokesman, Garba Shehu, has tested negative for coronavirus. This was revealed by Bashir Ahmaad, Buhari’s aide on new media, via his Twitter feed. “Mallam @GarShehu has tested NEGATIVE for #COVID19, Alhamdulillah! May God protect and grant us good health,” Ahmaad tweeted. This comes on the day that Kaduna state Governor, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, tested positive to COVID-19. El-Rufai is already in self-isolation.

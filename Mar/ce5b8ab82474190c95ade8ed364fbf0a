Daniel Sturridge has been handed a worldwide football ban until June 2020. The former Liverpool striker has also been fined £150,000, after being found guilty of breaching the FA’s gambling regulations. Sturridge terminated his contract with Turkish side Trabzonspor earlier on Monday. He was handed a two-week ban and a £75,000 fine in July. This came after a regulatory commission ruled that the player had provided his brother with “inside information”, advising him to bet on his possible transfer to Sevilla in January 2018. The FA considered the decision to be too soft and appealed the verdict. An independent appeal board has now proven two further charges against Sturridge which were originally dismissed.

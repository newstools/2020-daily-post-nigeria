Former Liverpool winger, John Barnes, has given reasons why Liverpool should not be awarded the English Premier League (EPL) title this season following the suspension of the English top-flight league. DAILY POST recalls that Premier League last Friday suspended all matches due to the deadly coronavirus. The Premier League will now resume April, subject to medical advice and conditions. Liverpool is currently on top of the Premier League table with 25 points above second-place Manchester City. But Barnes believe Jurgen Klopp’s side cannot be handed the Premier League title unless more fixtures are played. The 56-year-old told Sky Sports: “If you’re going to give Liverpool the title which team will then get relegated and promoted? “You can’t just say, ‘Liverpool get the title because we’re so far ahead’ because then what happens to Leeds, West Brom and Fulham? And what happens to the three teams at the bottom of the Premier League? “Obviously safety is the most important thing, but I think the best thing to do is to allow this season to take place, however long it takes. “There’s no need to rush back. Now that the Euros have been postponed, even if you play one game a week from October, then the season goes on to January or February. “Then, you can have a proper pre-season and kick-start the new season at the right time rather than be playing catch-up for years.”

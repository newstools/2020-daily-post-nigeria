Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has said he “cannot keep giving Tanguy Ndombele opportunities”, following their 1-1 draw at Burnley on Saturday. Mourinho took off the French midfielder at half time at Turf Moor. Ndombele became Spurs most expensive player, following his £54m move from Lyon, but has failed to impress at White Hart Lane. He started alongside Oliver Skipp, Ndombele only played for 45 minutes, before Mourinho decided he was not good enough. “I hope that he (Ndombele) uses every minute on the pitch, and every minute knowing what the Premier League, is to improve. There are many fantastic players that in first seasons in new countries, for different reasons, struggle. There are many examples. “He’s a player with a great talent, and he has to know he has to do much better, and I cannot keep giving him opportunities to play because the team is more important than the players, and they must be on the pitch as a consequence of their work and performance,” Mourinho told Sky Sports after the game. Ndombele has only made 12 starts in his first season in England.

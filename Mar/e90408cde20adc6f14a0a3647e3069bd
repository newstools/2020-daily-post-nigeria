Manchester United are ready to break the British transfer record, to land Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund, according to the UK Telegraph. United were linked with Sancho a year ago, but the 19-year-old ended up staying with the Bundesliga side, who refused to do business. However, Sancho will have just two years remaining on his current contract by the end of this season and Dortmund are open to sale. It is understood that United are close to agreeing terms with the England forward Sancho would reportedly earn around £200k-a-week at Old Trafford. United hope a transfer fee of over £100m (€115m) will get a deal done. If a Premier League club does pay that for him, he will become the most expensive transfer in the history of English football.

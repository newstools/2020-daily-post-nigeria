Former Barcelona and Cameroon striker, Samuel Eto’o, has told Samuel Chukwueze to work on his goalscoring. Chukwueze currently plays for Villarreal in the Spanish topflight. Last year, the 20-year-old made the Golden Boy 40-man shortlist and earned a call-up to Nigeria’s senior national team. The winger was part of the Super Eagles team that finished third at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations, scoring in the 2-1 win over South Africa in the quarter-finals. “He is an incredible player who is growing in leaps and bounds and it’s just a matter of time,” Eto’o told Goal. “He is a quality player and he needs to score more goals, but he has the quality and ability to be more than just a goalscoring forward. Once he gets all of that he will be top.”

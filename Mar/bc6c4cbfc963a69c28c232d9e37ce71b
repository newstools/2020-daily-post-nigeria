It was learnt that the gunmen forced their way into the apartment of one Elder Wuduowei, father of the slain girl after he (father) went to the hospital to check on his sick wife. It was also gathered that the slain girl who was left alone at the house alerted her father at the time the hoodlums were trying to force their way into the house but her father failed to inform Security Operatives of the incident on time. The father of the girl took the blame for failing to alert the Security Operatives on time. He said,”My delay in reaching out to security operatives led to her untimely death. Armed robbers attacked my house when I was not around and my daughter tried to reach me to alert me. “I was in the hospital because my wife is in labour before I could reach the head of vigilantes who accompanied me down it was already late. We saw her body cold after we saw signs of her being violated by the hoodlums.” The Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Mohammed Hafiz Inuwa is yet to respond to inquiry into the matter nor confirm the incident

The Federal Government in collaboration with Kano State Government has upgraded the Yargaya Health Dedication Center to cover Coronavirus outbreak in the entire Northern Nigeria. This is as the State frowned at some airlines who are not complying with the filling of the necessary forms for possible suspects of the Coronavirus victims. Speaking, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr Aminu Ibrahim Tsanyawa told newsmen Sunday that Kano has taken a bold step to ensure that the state is completely free of the Coronavirus diseases. Dr Aminu hints that the only problem they have is lack of a Viral Laboratory in the State that would ensure quick test of the Coronavirus in case of outbreak, urging the federal government to support them to achieve such. However, the Commissioner worries that at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, many passengers are not cooperating with their Staff attached to ensure visitors are fully screened. “This is very serious, but we are on top of the situation because we cannot allow airlines to do as they wish. We are ensuring that all passengers and airlines that come in fill the necessary forms and are also fully screened”.

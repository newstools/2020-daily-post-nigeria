This followed the intervention of the House of Representatives through its House Committee on Health Services. The Committee led by its chairman, Rep. Tanko Sununu, FCTA and the leadership of the Nigerian Medical Association (NMA) met on Friday. It was resolved that a committee of five persons be set up comprising a member of NMA, two members of the NARD FCT Chapter and two FCTA staff, to look into the issues relating to the payment of the doctors and report back. It was also resolved that FCT Administration should source for funds from alternative sources to pay flat rate to 36 Doctors that have not been paid between six to seven months pending when the issue is resolved.

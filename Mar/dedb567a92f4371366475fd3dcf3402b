Former Arsenal star, Paul Merson has identified Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk as best positioned to win the Premier League player of the year award this season. Merson believes Van Dijk should win the award ahead of his team-mate Jordan Henderson. Van Dijk’s fine performance has helped Jurgen Klopp’s side build a 22-point lead at the top of the league table. The Dutch international has started all 28 of Liverpool Premier League games this term, scoring four goals. Henderson has also been in top form in the midfield this season, netting 3 and providing 5 assists. However, Merson sees Van Dijk as the favourite to win the PFA player of the year award this season. Merson told Sky Sports, “Virgil van Dijk has to be up there. If you took him out of this team and put him in City’s team, City would win the league. If you put Henderson in City’s team, he wouldn’t even get in the team! “At the start of the season, Raheem Sterling was putting up figures that not even Messi and Ronaldo were putting up, but he’s not even a mention now. It’s all about the moment in time. Nobody remembers August, September and October! “Henderson, at the start of the season, wasn’t always in the team, or was being subbed or was a sub, but I think he is a must now and has turned it around. “He has dragged the team along when they have struggled, but for me he’s been the most improved players, and he thoroughly deserves to be up there, but for me I can’t get away from Van Dijk.” Liverpool were handed their third defeat of the season last night when they fell 2-0 to Chelsea crashing out of the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge.

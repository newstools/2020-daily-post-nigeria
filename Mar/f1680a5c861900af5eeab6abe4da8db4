The Bayelsa State governor, Senator Douye Diri, on Tuesday, said President Muhammadu Buhari treated him like a son when he visited him at the Aso Rock on Tuesday. Speaking to State House Correspondents after the meeting, Diri who said he visited Buhari privately, added that he was warmly received by the President. According to him, it was like a father receiving his son. The Governor also disclosed that he visited Buhari to forge a working relationship with the Federal Government. He said Buhari had promised that he is prepared to work with him. “Since I resumed as Governor of Bayelsa State, precisely on the 14th of February, I have not come to see the father of the nation. Today I just did that: to come and see the father of our country and to work with the federal government of Nigeria in ensuring peace and stability in my state and ensuring the development of my state. “Mr. President received me as one of his sons, as a state governor and the reception was very warm. He went ahead to advise that he was happy that I came and that he was happy with the way I have started. He went on to say he has read about all the statements that I have made and the security so far in Bayelsa,” he added. Senator Douye Diri received his Certificate of Return on February 14th after INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu declared him winner following the Supreme Court judgement sacking APC’s David Lyon.

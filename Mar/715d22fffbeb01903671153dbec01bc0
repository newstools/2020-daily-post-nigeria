Ogun State Government has confirmed a new case of the coronavirus in the state. Commissioner for Health, Dr Tomi Coker, spoke to the press Tuesday evening in Abeokuta. She said the case was a 62-year-old male domiciled at Sagamu area of the state who had returned from the United Kingdom on March 17. The commissioner disclosed that 32 contacts had been detected – 28 healthcare givers and four family members. “The patient is said to have a history of cough and was tested positive of the coronavirus. He recently returned from the United Kingdom and the contacts were traced. “All his contacts who are 28, healthcare giver and four members of his family, 32 altogether, we’ve been able to contact them.” Coker said he’s been very responsible by isolating himself since he arrived. “He has been transferred to our isolation centre which is at the Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital in Sagamu”. The official urged the public to remain calm and practise proper hygiene by regularly washing their hands. The federal government earlier in the day confirmed two other cases.

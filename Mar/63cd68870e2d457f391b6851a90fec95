The Nigeria Medical Association, Ekiti State chapter, has called for proper punitive action against health institutions that circumvents the normal protocols in the screening and treatment of COVID-19. The health association said adhering to rules governing the treatment of contagious disease like Coronavirus becomes imperative to avoid further spread of the disease. NMA also called on Ekiti government to upgrade facilities at the isolation centre while also fast tracking action on the conclusion of test on the American citizen suspected to have had contact with his deceased counter part, who brought the disease to Ekiti. This was contained in a statement signed on Saturday by its Chairman, Dr Tunji Omotayo, Secretary, Dr Tunji Olaoye and Chairman Emergency Response Committee on COVID-19, Dr Olumuyiwa Oluyide. “The NMA Ekiti Emergency Response Committee visited the Isolation Centre in the State where the confirmed case is being monitored. The facilities in the Isolation Centre is satisfactory but there is still a room for improvement. “There is a need to upgrade the facilities at Isolation center. We advocate contact tracing and quarantine of the contacts of the index case in Ekiti State and those who show symptoms should be isolated as soon as possible. “The non-conclusive result of the suspected index case of an American male should be repeated. “The laid down protocols of collecting and transporting samples of suspected cases to reference laboratories should be strictly adhered to. “Any health institution that violates the protocols should be sanctioned accordingly,” it said. NMA advised against peddling of fake news at this time, saying it is capable of causing unnecessary panic among the people.

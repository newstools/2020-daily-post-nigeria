Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, will do everything he can to push through a move to Barcelona this summer, according to Sport. Aubameyang has insisted publicly that he is happy at the Emirates Stadium. But it is believed that he made up his mind about joining Barca as early as January. Aubameyang, 30, will have only one year left on his current deal by the end of the season. If he does not sign a new deal, the Gunners will be faced with the dilemma of keeping him until he is a free agent or selling. The Gabon striker is currently the Premier Leagueâ€™s joint-top goalscorer with 17 goals. Aubameyang has also been linked with Real Madrid and Inter Milan.

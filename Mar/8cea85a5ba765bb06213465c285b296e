The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) on Wednesday postponed the 2020 edition of Conference of (African) Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. The decision was announced in a statement made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday in Lagos by the Communications Section of UNECA as a precaution against COVID-19.

The 53rd session of the Conference was earlier scheduled to hold in Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, from March 18 to March 24, 2020. The statement reads: “Following global health concerns pertaining to the COVID-19 and the need for added vigilance, upon consultation with partners, the ECA will postpone all its public meetings until further notice. “These include the 2020 Conference of Ministers of Finance, Planning and Economic Development. “ECA will reach out to ministers to discuss member states preparedness,” the statement read in part.

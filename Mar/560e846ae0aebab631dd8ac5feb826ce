Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has told the board to do whatever it takes to keep Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at the club beyond this season. Aubameyang will have one year left on his current contract by the summer. The 30-year-old is desperate to play Champions League football again and has been linked with Barcelona and Inter Milan. Arsenal are keen to keep Aubameyang, but his contract situation leaves the Gunners in an awkward predicament. Speaking on Thursday ahead of this weekend’s Premier League clash against West Ham, Arteta said: “We will have to do that [sort out his deal] before the end of the season. “I want to keep him in any circumstances.”

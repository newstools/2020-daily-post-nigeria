The Edo State Government has arrested a 70-year-old man, identified as Mr. John Eseigbe, who allegedly defiled and raped a 14-year-old girl. Maria Edeko, Commissioner for Social Development and Gender Issues, who disclosed this in a chat with journalists in Benin, said the investigation is part of efforts by the Governor Godwin Obaseki-led administration to ensure child molestation, rape and defilement are drastically reduced in the State. She said the 14-year-old girl who is currently receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital was getting stable. “Governor Godwin Obaseki has said no child under his watch will be defiled, raped or molested. He is determined to ensure that the right of every girl-child in Edo State is protected. “The issue of child defilement for Obaseki is a serious issue and culprits must be punished for their crimes. We are talking about the 14-year-old girl today. We will not turn a blind eye to such crime as offenders should be ready to go jail.” But speaking, Eseigbe, while denying the allegation, said that the girl, who lives with his family, stole from him and was sent packing by his wife. He added that the parents of the girl are friends to his family, and he could not have jeopardized the long-standing relationship that exists between both families.

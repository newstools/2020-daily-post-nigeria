As Nigeria battles to curtail the Spread of COVID-19, otherwise known as coronavirus, Nigeria’s leading Fiber to the Home (FTTH) Broadband service provider, FiberOne Broadband has announced that it has upgraded all the subscribers on its SmartHome plan of 10Mbps to 20Mbps unlimited.
This comes as more and more people are switching to the work from home routine to restrict the spread of the highly contagious Coronavirus or COVID-19.
FiberOne has also implemented more measures to help its technical personnel stay safe in case they have to respond to a support related issue at customer’s home or the outdoor network infrastructure in your area. In an email shared with subscribers, FiberOne Broadband says, “As our country continues to manage the COVID-19 crisis, we recognize that our company plays an important role in helping our customers stay connected. As schools suspend classes, businesses close and companies ask their employees to work from home, we want to ensure that our customers have faster broadband speed to work, learn, and carry on with their lives as we all address this collective challenge”. They also confirmed that the support personnel, who may need to visit the customer premises have been provided with sanitization kits and trained to maintain the highest levels of hygiene. FiberOne offers truly unlimited broadband speed for its home subscribers, and you never need to bother running out of data. This allows you to stream videos endlessly within the subscribed month.

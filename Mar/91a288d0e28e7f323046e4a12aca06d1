Manchester United pay Odion Ighalo £8,000 for each goal he scores, the UK Sun reports. The Nigerian striker has a number of performance-related clauses included in the six-month loan deal he signed with the Red Devils in January. He has scored four goals in three starts so far. Ighalo also gets an extra £9,000 for every Premier League win in which he is involved in the squad and £3,000 for a draw. If United qualify for the Champions League, the 30-year-old will share from a cash pot with his team-mates. Despite these clauses, Ighalo still earns significantly less than he did at Shanghai Shenhua, after taking a 40% pay-cut to seal a move to his boyhood club.

All residents of Adamawa State are to stay back home with effect from the dawn of Wednesday, April 1. The tens of thousands of Keke NAPEP that serve as taxis in the state capital and other major towns across the state are banned and markets are to shut down, a statement from the government indicated Monday. “The Adamawa State Government has imposed a lockdown throughout the state in an effort to avoid the spread of Coronavirus disease for a period of 14 days with effect from midnight Tuesday, March 31st 2020,” the statement said. The statement, signed by Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, Press Secretary to Governor Ahmadu Fintiri, said the governor felt that though the decision for the lockdown is painful, it is necessary to save lives. The statement specified that interstate travel restriction is imposed and interstate and international borders are to remain shut during the 14-day period of the lockdown. “The ban affects tricycle, taxis and bus operators throughout the state,” it added. It said the lockdown became particularly inevitable after the government realised that the earlier directive to workers on grade levels 1-14 to stay at home was not effective. “Government is left with no option than to impose the lockdown in the overall interest of the people as Covid-19 continues to spread with 111 reported cases in Nigeria so far. Markets are also hereby restricted, except for those selling food items and pharmaceuticals,” the statement said. It added that filling stations could also operate, while banks are to provide skeletal services.

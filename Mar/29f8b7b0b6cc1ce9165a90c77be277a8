The Pastor in charge of Chosen Apostolic Church (Galilee) in Oviorie Community, Ethiope-East Local Government Area of Delta State, Pastor, Efeoghene Onovughakpor Samuel on Sunday said the shutdown of the state by the order of Governor Arthur Ifeanyi Okowa will bring hunger to the people of the State. The cleric made the assertion in a chat with Our Correspondent at the Church. “Shutting down the State will bring hunger to the people because there are some people who are having five to six children. ” Now, price of garri has increased. As a pastor, people are now complaining to me this morning that their children have not eaten. I had to go home and give them food, give them rice, give them oil. All these on my own account. This will bring more hunger to the people.” Pastor Samuel said the State Government should make the “sit-at-home” order very minimal as well as make available essentially commodities to the people without delays. Pastor Samuel also said the shutting down order will make many of the people who are traders to lose their commodities and monies. While thanking the governor for putting measures to prevent the spread of the Coronavirus, Pastor Samuel, however, urged the people of the State to obey the governor’s order to stay at home. He said,”They should not disobey the voice of the governor or the president. They should obey that.” Pastor Samuel who led worshippers in a Sunday service also said, ” Sunday service is a day God set aside that we should keep the sabbath day holy. “We must give that honour to God. We must not disobey God over that. We should make our services very short so that we can go home on time.” While noting that Nigeria has not seen the worse of Corona-Virus pandemic, Pastor Samuel said,”God is still in control.”

An Oredo magistrates’ court in Benin City on Thursday, discharged two men, Isah Abubakar,29 and Aruna Hassan, 20, who were charged with stealing 150 liters of red oil from an old woman. The Magistrate, Esosa Osifo-Ehigiegbe, however, said she has dismissed charge, but not on the merit. The magistrate discharged the defendants following an application by the police prosecutor, ASP, Violent Soyemi, who told the court to dismiss the case because the complainant, Mrs Esther Ojo wanted to withdraw her case. According to Mrs Ojo, “I do not want to continue with the case because the defendants’ brother has been begging me. “They do not have money to pay me for the oil they stole and I can’t watch them suffering in the correctional centre. So as a mother I have forgiven them.’ The Police had arraigned the two defendants alongside with a 21-year-old man, Kabrinu Satiyanu on two count charge of conspiracy and stealing. Satiyanu, however, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to serve jail terms, but Isah and Hassan pleaded not guilty but could not perfect the bail conditions and were remanded in Oko correctional centre. ASP Soyemi had alleged that on Dec. 19, 2019 at Adesuwa street, off Upper Lawani road, New Benin area in Benin City, the defendants conspired among themselves and stole 570 liters of Red Oil. The prosecutor said the offence contravened Section 516 and 390 (9) of the Criminal Code of the defunct Bendel State of Nigeria, 1976, now applicable to Edo. Which prescribes 7years in prison each, if found guilty.

Rangers boss, Steven Gerrard, has admitted he could leave the club. Gerrard watched on Saturday, as his team crashed out of the Scottish Cup, following a 1-0 defeat to Hearts. Only three days ago, Rangers defeated Braga 1-0 in Portugal, to progress to the last 16 of the Europa League. However, poor form in the Premiership, has seen the Ibrox outfit by 12 points and looking at another trophyless season. Speaking after the loss to relegation-threatened Hearts, Gerrard told reporters: “I’m feeling pain right now because I want to win here, I’m desperate to win here. But looking from the side today, I didn’t get the impression that the feeling amongst my players was the same. “I’m not doubting myself. But it’s tough when you feel like this after performances like that. “I need to analyse myself, for sure. Is it still possible to win here? It will be extremely difficult in the short term because of where we are in the league.” Gerrard has been linked with a return to Liverpool, in a bid for him to finally win a Premier League medal.

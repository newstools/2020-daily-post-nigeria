The 65-year-old has been allowed to go home, after suffering a life-threatening stroke. Dolores posted a picture of herself on Instagram and wrote: “I am lucky to have the opportunity to live to love my family and have them close to me. “Thank you to everyone for their support and affection. These have been difficult days but of struggle and victory. “Now I’m at home surrounded by the love of my family, my good energy. “I will stay here as I like to but always looking after myself first. Everything will be fine.”

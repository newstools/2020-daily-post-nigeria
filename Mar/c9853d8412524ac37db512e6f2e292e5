Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, will be without Steven Bergwijn for a lengthy period after the Dutch forward picked up an ankle problem during their 1-1 draw with Burnley on Saturday. Bergwijn’s injury further depletes Mourinho’s attacking options. The Portuguese is already without the injured Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. “Following assessment and examination by our medical team, we can confirm that Steven Bergwijn suffered a significant sprain to his left ankle during our match against Burnley,” an official club statement read. “The Netherlands international will now undergo an extended period of rehabilitation where his progress will continue to be assessed.” Bergwijn will miss Tuesday’s trip to Leipzig, where Spurs must overturn a 1-0 first leg deficit, to progress to the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has denied rumours that he will give out £3.25million to help Ronaldinho get out of jail. Ronaldinho was arrested early this month, for allegedly entering Paraguay with a fake passport. The 39-year-old is facing up to six months in prison. Last week, there were rumours that Messi wants to help his former Barca team-mate, by hiring four top lawyers to take on his case, a move that would have cost him up to £3.25m. However, according to Catalan publication Sport, Messi’s advisors have made it clear they will not be assisting Ronaldinho financially, even though he sympathises with the Brazilian. Ronaldinho is being held alongside his brother Roberto in a jail on the outskirts of the Paraguayan capital Asuncion.

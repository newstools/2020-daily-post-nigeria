Ahead of Monday’s hearing at the Supreme Court, the camp of former Imo State Governor, Emeka Ihedioha of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has expressed optimism that they will get justice. At the first hearing in his suit against the judgement which installed Hope, Uzodinma of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as Imo governor, the court adjourned hearing to March 2. Ihedioha, through his lawyer and former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Kanu Agabi (SAN) wants the court to remove Uzodinma from office. On Sunday, Ihedioha’s special assistant on new media, AIC Akwarandu, told DAILY POST that they expect that the apex court will be fair. “We are confident that Justice will be done in the matter. The issues are very clear, ranging from mathematical imbalance to issues of geographical spread to other salient issues”, he said. “The Supreme Court has another opportunity to prove to Nigerians, who are all watching that, indeed the court is the last hope of the common man. We believe Ihedioha will be declared winner. “Ihedioha has conducted himself in the best manner during this period. No violence attack on anybody, no riot. He strongly believes in Nigeria and the fact that justice can be done in this country.” The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN) Justice Tanko Muhammad heads the panel hearing Ihedioha’s suit. The same panel will hear the application by Zamfara APC, challenging the governorship election judgement in favour of the PDP and Governor Bello Matawalle. Other members of the panel are Justices Kayode Ariwoola, Kudirat Kekere-Ekun, Inyang Okoro, Amina Augie, Sylvester Ngwuta and Uwani Abba-Aji. The court in January ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to recognise Uzodinma as duly elected. The judgment delivered by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun declared that the APC candidate polled majority votes.

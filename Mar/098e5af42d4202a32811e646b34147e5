One of President Muhammadu Buhari’s media aides, Tolu Ogunlesi, has claimed that a sitting Governor in Nigeria, can remove any traditional leader. Ogunlesi was reacting on his Twitter page, to the dethronement of Sanusi Lamido Sanusi as the Emir of Kano by the state Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje, on Monday. “A sitting governor can dethrone anybody – they have the power. “That is the way the system is set up. Nobody is above being dethroned. Governors formally appoint them, present them the staff of office and fund their offices,” he wrote. Ogunlesi also cited the incident involving Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State, who “paraded Rivers traditional rulers recently and addressed them like a kindergarten class. “That is the power a governor has over royal institutions. Every governor. It actually didn’t start today, it has been so for a long time.” Sanusi has since arrived in Nasarawa state where he will be on exile. Aminu Ado Bayero has already been named as his replacement and the 15th Emir of the State.

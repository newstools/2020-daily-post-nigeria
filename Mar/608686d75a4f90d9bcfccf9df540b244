Gunmen suspected to be armed bandits stormed some villages in Igabi and Giwa Local Government Areas of Kaduna State, killed 30 and injured several others. The affected villages were Kerawa, Rago, Marina, Zariyawa, Hashimawa, Gidan Musa Saidu, and Unguwar Barau. Although the police authorities and Kaduna state government are yet to confirm the attack, an indigene of Giwa local government who does not want his name in print told DAILY POST in Kaduna on Monday that, unspecified numbers of bandits attacked the villages and killed over 30 people including men and women. He said, already troops of the Nigerian Army and Air Force launched offensive attacks against the bandits and in the process, killed many of them. Another source also said that the bandits launched the attacks in what seems like revenge against the villagers who they accused of providing information to security agencies which resulted in the killing of their members previous weeks. As at the time of filing this report, the military is still carrying out offensive attacks on camps occupied by the bandits inside the thick forests within Giwa, Birnin Gwari and Igabi local government areas. Also, several calls to Kaduna Police Public Relations Officer were not picked even as he did not respond to text message sent to him.

The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has arrested the suspended Chairman of the Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property (SPIP), Okoi Obono-Obla. ICPC spokesperson, Mrs Rasheedat Okoduwa, disclosed this in a statement on Friday night. Obono-Obla, former Special Assistant on Prosecution to President Muhammadu Buhari, had been on the run from the law after he was declared wanted. ”Obono-Obla’s arrest by operatives of the commission on Friday in Abuja, comes after he was declared wanted in October last year by ICPC for repeatedly failing to honour invitations sent to him. “The commission, while investigating allegations of abuse of office, certificate forgery and fraud amongst others, had wanted Obono-Obla to appear before it to clear his name.” The official disclosed that ICPC had kept surveillance on his activities until he was finally nabbed along Aso Drive opposite the Millennium Park Abuja on Friday afternoon. Okoduwa added that the former presidential aide was taken to the ICPC headquarters and run through custody protocols including medical profiling. Obono-Obla had denied the allegations against him. He linked his ordeal to Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo.

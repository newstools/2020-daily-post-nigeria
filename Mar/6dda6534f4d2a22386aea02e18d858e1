A political scientist, Professor Hassan Saliu, in Ilorin Thursday, reflected on the travail of deposed Emir Sanusi Lamido Sanusi of Kano, saying ” he should only try to negotiate his freedom, rather than think of coming back to the throne.” He cautioned traditional rulers to watch politics more closely and avoid being identified with any tendency. “Although, he was not the only one talking about the situation in the country, he was the loudest among the traditional rulers,” Professor Salihu of the Department of Political science, University of Ilorin told Daily Post in a press chat. “He talks too much, not bearing in mind that he was not the only concerned Nigerian, as an Emir, his fate was in the hand of the governor. “He was firing from all cylinders, taking on the political establishment without knowing that as an emir, he should be circumspect,” the university teacher added. On lessons of his dilemma, Professor Salihu said, ” Sanusi should not allow himself to be pushed around by people in taking unnecessary risks, because the dream he has is not being shared by the political gladiators across board.” Asserting that “the case of Emir Sanusi is a complicated one,” he said the foundation for his ascension and deposition was politics” and advised that ” he should only try to negotiate for his freedom, not thinking of coming back to the throne.” He said “Sanusi’s announcement as the emir of Kano was shrouded in controversy as a counter announcement was made in the direction of the new Emir Bayero, but the power that be that time suppressed the information because he was seen as having sympathy for the All Progressives Congress, how time flies.”

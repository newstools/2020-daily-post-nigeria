Tyson Fury’s promoter, Bob Arum, has insisted that a heavyweight unification fight between his client and Anthony Joshua cannot hold because Joshua will lose his next contest against Kubrat Pulev. DAILY POST recalls that Fury and Joshua are both on course for a unification fight after their next contests against Deontay Wilder and Kubrat Pulev, respectively. But Arum doubts Fury will ever fight Joshua, who he expects to lose to Pulev at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, June 20. “Fury-Joshua is never going to happen,” Arum told The Times. “Pulev is going to knock Joshua out, so why would I talk to his promoter, Eddie, who I love dearly, about a Joshua-Fury fight? “I think Pulev wins, and then I negotiate with myself to do a Pulev-Fury fight. “Let us make this crystal clear, I am co-promoter of Tyson, and the other co-promoter is Frank Warren. “I would not talk to Eddie about a fight without Frank’s participation. Frank’s never even talked with Eddie.” Fury knocked out Deontay Wilder in the 7th round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, USA, in their rematch last month to regain the WBC world heavyweight title. Joshua defeated Mexican-American fighter, Andy Ruiz Jr, in their rematch last December.

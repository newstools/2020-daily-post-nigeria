The bill for the establishment of the Ondo State Security Network Agency and Amotekun Corps was, on Monday, signed into law by Governor Akeredolu. The bill received the governor’s nod following its earlier passage by the state legislative body. While emphasizing that the security outfit will not be allowed for political activities in the state, Akeredolu maintained that Amotekun was established solely for the security of lawful residents within the six south west states. He reiterated that the Amotekun Corps shall be complementary and not independent of the operations and efforts of the nation’s security agencies. “We wish to reiterate that the Amotekun Corps is a child of necessity and was purely borne out of the need to explore other means of securing our forests and protecting all those who do legitimate business within the Southwest Region. “For the umpteenth time, the Amotekun Corps is not an independent regional outfit but a complementary effort by the governors of the Southwest to engender unity, peace, and security. “Most importantly, the corps shall not be allowed for political purposes; it has no business at political rallies just as the Police must continue to discharge its obligations and responsibilities to the people”, Akeredolu stated. He, however, commended the House of Assembly for the promptness in the handling of the Bill, stressing that, their speed and thoroughness underscored the importance attached to the bill.

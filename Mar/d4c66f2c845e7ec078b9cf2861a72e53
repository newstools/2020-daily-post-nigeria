Nnamdi Azikiwe University (UNIZIK), Awka, Anambra State chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), has joined the nationwide two weeks warning strike of the body.
The Chairman of the institution’s chapter of ASUU, Comrade Stephen Ufoaro, while addressing members during a congress to commence the warning strike at the multipurpose hall of the institution on Tuesday, said the strike became imperative, since the Federal government failed to reach a logical conclusion on their demands.
He told his colleagues that the strike was following the decision of the Federal Government to stop salaries of lecturers who have not enrolled in the Integrated Payroll and Personnel Information System (IPPIS).
He said the Unizik chapter of the body was also opposing the use of IPPIS as a payment platform for Nigeria Universities lecturers. “This strike action is to compel federal government to implement the long awaiting agreement of the Memorandum of Understand (MoU) of 2013 and and Memorandum of Action in 2019 implemented, which the federal government failed to implement,” he said.
A lecturer, Prof. Au Nonyelu, in his contribution, said, “We joined in the struggle in order to protect the welfare of our members and to secure the future of our children and that of others as well.
“We are doing this to lay the foundation for a university system capable of competing with International Universities, in Nigeria.”

Japan’s Olympic minister, Seiko Hashimoto, has said the IOC has the right to cancel this year’s Olympic Games, “only if they are not held during 2020”. Hashimoto, however, feels the coronavirus outbreak could lead to the Tokyo Games being staged later in 2020. The Olympics are scheduled to start July 24, while the Paralympics open on August 25. However, Hashimoto, responding to questions in the Upper House of Parliament, admits the dates could be moved. Coronavirus has been blamed for 12 deaths in Japan and has shut down most schools, sports competitions and Olympic-related events in the country. “The IOC has the right to cancel the games only if they are not held during 2020,” Hashimoto told parliament. When asked if she believed the Olympics should be held, even if the coronavirus outbreak is worse than it is now, Hashimoto replied: “We are making the utmost effort so that we don’t have to face that situation.”

All Premier League clubs are expected to decide what will happen to the rest of the season, amid the coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, Liverpool would discover if this season will be called off and they are crowned champions. The Reds are 25 points clear at the top of the table and look set to dethrone Manchester City with two more wins. However, the Premier League has been put on hold until April, over fears of the COVID-19 virus spreading. The Evening Standard reports the Premier League may need to take a vote from clubs, on whether to scrap the league altogether. The rules state that a majority of 14 clubs, must agree in order for any new legislation to be passed. “Clubs have the opportunity to propose new rules or amendments at the Shareholder meeting. “Each Member Club is entitled to one vote and all rule changes and major commercial contracts require the support of at least a two-thirds vote, or 14 clubs, to be agreed,” the rule, as written on the Premier League’s official website, reads.

The National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) has announced there are five laboratories in Nigeria, where people can test for coronavirus. They are located in Lagos, Edo, Osun States and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). This was confirmed in a tweet posted by NCDC’s official handle on Wednesday. “Nigeria has 5 labs with the capacity to test for #COVID19 located in FCT, Lagos, Edo and Osun States,” it read. The NCDC also noted that “any person who meets the national case definition for #COVID19 is tested at NO COST in any of our five molecular laboratories with testing capacity in-country”. Five new cases were reported in the country yesterday. It has led to several states banning large gatherings, while the federal government also shut down National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) camps.

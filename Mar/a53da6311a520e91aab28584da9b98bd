Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard has reportedly asked the club’s board to make a transfer move for Manchester United’s target, Declan Rice as midfielder, Jorginho’s replacement, according to Sky Sports. Lampard, who is a huge admirer of Rice, wants to sign the England international to slot into his starting XI next season, likely at the expense of Jorginho, who joined Chelsea in 2018 from Napoli. Chelsea are interested in signing Rice, who currently plays for West Ham United this summer but face competition from Man United for the player’s signature. Rice started his career at Chelsea, but he joined West Ham after he was let go by West London club as a teenager. The 21-year-old is a close friend of Chelsea star, Mason Mount, following his time at the Blues. Chelsea is currently on the fourth position on the Premier League table following the postponement of the English top-flight competition until April 30 due to the spread of coronavirus across the globe.

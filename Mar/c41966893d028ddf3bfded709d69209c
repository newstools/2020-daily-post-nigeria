The Coalition of United Political Parties, CUPP, has described President Muhammadu Buhari as a man who cannot even run a Local Government Area. The Coalition said this as the Federal Government decided to place a travel ban on some countries on Wednesday, after what seemed like an unnecessary delay. CUPP statement was signed and made available to DAILY POST on Wednesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere. The Coalition also attacked the President for having not visited the site of the explosion that happened in Lagos on Sunday. “A Nation with a man not fit to run a Local Government or kindred union is doomed,” Ugochinyere said. “Heard they have decided to place travel restrictions after wasting time doing nothing. “Now the Coronavirus infection has started spreading with 5(five) new cases just announced today and another suspected new case in a village in Katsina, the President’s State with weak health infrastructure. “Nations like Ghana, South Africa, the USA with strong health infrastructure took proactive travel restriction measures and our President refused to do anything not even to visit the scene of the deadly explosion in Lagos but hid inside Aso Rock only for his government to announce travel restrictions after more people from the UK, the USA, Malaysia brought in more infections. “Mr. President continues doing as you wish because you have conquered all the institutions that could have kept you in check including the legislative House of Hallelujah made up of Hallelujah Boys,” he said.

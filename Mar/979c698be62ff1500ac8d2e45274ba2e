Medical Doctors in Anambra State, under the aegis of Conference of Civil Service Doctors, on Sunday, embarked on an indefinite strike action. The strike, DAILY POST learnt is sequel to the alleged failure of the state government to adhere to agreement signed with them. The State Chairman of the group, Dr Livinus Chukwuma, who briefed journalists at the General Hospital Onitsha, yesterday said, “This strike is necessitated by the failure of the state Government to adhere to the agreement signed with the Civil Service Doctors and Nigerian Medical Association on one part and the Government of Anambra state on the other.” He recalled that doctors in the state had earlier embarked on 13 months strike action due to the failure of the state government to accept the Consolidated Medical Salary Structure, as prescribed by the Federal Government as the standard for all doctors in the federal civil services. He said that the strike was called off after intervention by eminent persons and an agreement reached and an MoU signed which, stipulated that the government would periodically review the salaries until 100 per cent was achieved, starting from 50 per cent. He said that Federal Government in 2014 reviewed the CONMESS upwards. “This is inspite of all efforts made for state government to see reason, including a warning strike in 2019, the review has not affected our salaries.”

National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Adams Oshiomhole, will continue in office, despite his suspension, DAILY POST have gathered. A top APC official who spoke with DAILY POST on Thursday said Oshiomhole has appealed his suspension, hence will continue in office. Recall that a Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court on Wednesday suspended the APC National Chairman from parading himself as leader of the party. Justices Danlami Senchi held that the APC National Chairman should step down pending the determination of a substantive suit seeking his removal from office. The judge had given the ruling in an application of interlocutory injunction following his suspension as a member of the APC from Etsako ward 10 in Edo State. However, a source while reacting to the suspension said: “Oshiomhole remains the National Chairman of APC until he gets stay of execution, you know he has appealed the suspension, can’t talk much on this.”

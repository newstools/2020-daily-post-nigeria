The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared coronavirus a global pandemic. This followed the fast spread of the deadly diseases globally. WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, made the announcement at a press conference at the organization’s headquarters in Geneva. “In the past two weeks the number of cases outside China has increased thirteenfold and the number of affected countries has tripled”, he said. “In the days and weeks ahead, we expect to see the number of cases, the number of deaths and the number of affected countries to climb even higher.” Tedros observed that several countries have demonstrated the ability to suppress and control the outbreak. He, however, criticized other world leaders for not act quickly enough. “We’re deeply concerned both by the alarming levels of spread and severity and by the alarming levels of inaction. We have rung the alarm bell loud and clear. “We can not say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough, all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. “Some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resources. Some countries are struggling with a lack of resolve”, the DG regretted. Nigeria recorded its first case on February 27.

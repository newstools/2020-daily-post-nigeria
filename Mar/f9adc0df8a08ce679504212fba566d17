The Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodinma, has claimed that those working to remove Adams Oshiomhole as the National Chairman of the All Progressives (APC), are sponsored by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Uzodinma stated this while speaking with reporters in Owerri, the state capital. He vowed that Oshiomhole would not be humiliated out of office. According to Uzodinma, there set guidelines for removing national officers of the party, which are not being followed. “Many of us, leaders of the party, are aware that those clamouring for the chairman’s removal are working with the PDP to destabilise the party,” Uzodinma said. “But they will fail because we will not allow them to humiliate our national chairman out of the party through illegal means or by dropping the name of Mr. President. “So, I advise those dropping the name of the President on their wicked plans to desist forthwith. He has done nothing wrong and no amount of propaganda and illegal plots can succeed in removing him from office.” Oshiomhole had accused a serving minister and some Governors of being responsible for his ordeal.

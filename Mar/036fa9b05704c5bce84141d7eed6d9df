Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, has insisted that the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government was not doing enough to protect Nigerians from Coronavirus when compared to other African countries. AYCF President-General, Yerima Shettima while speaking to DAILY POST faulted the reduction of fuel pump price, following the outbreak of COVID-19. He maintained that the price reduction has little or no impact on the common man. When asked if Buhari-led government has done enough amid the scourge, the AYCF President-General said: “No, this government is not doing enough when compared to other countries. At a critical moment such as this one would have expected the government to stand on the side of the people. “I’m sure if this virus was only in Nigeria, most of our leaders would have left the country with their family members but thank God its a global thing. In fact, it is even safer to be in Nigeria than in foreign countries and that’s why they have remained. “One of interesting thing is that if you look at the way government was standing on the side of the people in other African countries and part of the world, you will realize that Nigeria has not done anything. The question I keep asking is, does the reduction of fuel pump price have any effect on the common man as regards this disease, I will tell you no. “How many poor people have cars to drive and use generator? if you reduce N20 what impact does that make to Nigerians, rather than doing that I would have advised that the government bring preventive measures and lets be more proactive and not until this whole thing consumes everybody.” Meanwhile, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria presently stands at 40. While two patients have been discharged, Nigeria recorded one death on Monday, according to the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC.

A Coronavirus patient in her early 20’s has reportedly escaped from an isolation facility in Ghana. Ghana Citi News reported that the patient was one of the eight Guineans who recently tested positive for COVID-19. Northern Regional Minister, Salifu Saeed on Tuesday confirmed that the patient scaled a wall on Monday at the facility in Tamale on Monday. Salifu described the incident as “a very disturbing situation as she is infected” and can harm others with the deadly virus. “Since yesterday, up till this morning, I have not slept, with my security people. I directed that they should use all their networks to track the persona down and get her,” Mr. Saeed was quoted by the publication. Mr. Saeed, however, urged citizens to be calm as security agencies are on top of the situation. “Ghanaians are safe, we are working very hard to ensure that the people don’t get too panicked. Nobody should be afraid because the security personnel are on top of the issues.” As of 31st March 2020, Ghana has recorded 152 cases of coronavirus.

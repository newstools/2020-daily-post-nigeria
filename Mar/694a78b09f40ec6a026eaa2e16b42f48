Tottenham Hotspur captain, Harry Kane, has admitted he is frustrated at not winning trophies with the club and is ready to leave if they don’t make progress. Kane has been out since January with a hamstring injury, as Spurs exited all competitions and are in danger of missing out on the Champions League. In an interview with Sky Sports pundit, Jamie Redknapp, the England striker said he was determined to be one of the best players in the world. When asked if he would leave Tottenham, he replied: “It’s one of those things, I couldn’t say yes, I couldn’t say no. I love Spurs, I’ll always love Spurs. “I’m an ambitious player, I want to improve, I want to get better, I want to become one of the top, top players. “It all depends on what happens as a team and how we progress as a team. So it’s not a definite I’m going to stay there forever – but it’s not a no either.”

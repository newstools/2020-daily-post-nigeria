The Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has changed its recruitment portal to www.immigrationrecruitment.org.ng. The NIS Public Relations Officer, Sunday James, confirmed this in a statement on Saturday in Abuja. He noted that the former portal www.nisrecruitment.org.ng was no longer in use. “The Service hereby informs the general public that the recruitment portal has been changed to www.immigrationrecruitment.org.ng which is currently active to make it more accessible to applicants. “The Comptroller General, NIS , Mr Muhammad Babandede , wishes to inform the general Public that the recruitment exercise is free and aside the change of portal, all information contained in the public notice for recruitment remain valid,” James said.

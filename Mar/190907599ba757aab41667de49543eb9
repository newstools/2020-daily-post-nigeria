On Friday, the Premier League finally decided to suspend football fixtures until April 3 at least, because of the outbreak of coronavirus. The decision was taken after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Calum Hudson-Odoi, tested positive to the illness. A number of topflight clubs have also instructed their players to go into self-isolation. It has raised questions about the eventual cancellation of this season, with many asking how it could potentially affect champions-elect Liverpool. The UK Telegraph says there would be “no guarantee” that Liverpool would be crowned champions, if the current season was cut short. It would be an anti-climax for Jurgen Klopp’s men, who are set to lift their first ever Premier League trophy and first league title in 30 years. There are no set regulations in the rule book, of what would happen should the competition be cancelled early. So it is not clear at this moment, how relegation and promotion will be sorted out. Also, how will qualification for the Champions League, Europa League and other domestic and international competitions be determined? SportsMail insists that “in all likelihood the season will finish in the summer and Liverpool will finally get their hands on the trophy then.”

Former Nigeria vice-president, Atiku Abubakar, has suggested that the President Muhammadu Buhari administration should reduce the pump price of petrol. Atiku said this in a statement on Tuesday, as the third case of coronavirus was confirmed in Nigeria. He also advised that stamp duty on all types of accounts be temporarily suspended. “I recommend that policies like the stamp duty on all types of accounts be temporarily suspended, until such time as the nation’s economy has turned the tide in the fight against this virulent scourge. “Furthermore, as the landing cost of premium motor spirit, also known as petrol, has reduced significantly, it is strongly recommended that the government should not absorb the savings, but should pass it on to the Nigerian people by way of reducing the pump price of PMS to reflect the current prevailing market costs,” part of the statement read. DAILY POST reports that Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan, claimed that Buhari has refused to restrict flights from high-risk countries, because Atiku raised the suggestion.

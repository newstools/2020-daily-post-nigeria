Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has spoken in detail for the first time about his coronavirus infection. Arteta tested positive on March 12 ahead of a trip to Manchester City, leading to the Premier League postponing fixtures. The Spaniard believes he contracted COVID-19, after the team’s Europa League clash against Greek side Olympiakos, whose owner had the coronavirus. “I am feeling completely recovered. It’s true I started having some symptoms when we got the phone call from the club [Olympiakos] to let us know that we might be exposed to the virus. I don’t know, I felt something within me, that I had it. “Then you realise, ‘Wow, everybody can be exposed here, this is very serious’ and you start to think about the people that you’ve been in contact with and the other people that can be related to us. That’s when a bit of fear comes,” Arteta told Arsenal’s website

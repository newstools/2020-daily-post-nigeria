Katsina Governor, Aminu Masari, says the recent attacks and killings in rural communities across the state was due to ignorance and barbaric behaviour. Masari spoke when he received members of the National Commission for Refugees, Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI) led by its Federal Commissioner, Bashir Garba, on Thursday. “This is a barbaric and animalistic behaviour because the perpetrators of these crimes are like animals because they don’t have western or Qur’anic education”, NAN quoted him as saying. “These people are living with animals in the bush without any education, they behave like wild animals in the bush,” Masari said. Masari revealed that many suspects were arrested in connection with the case. The governor appealed to the commission to consult with the government and people of the state over their plan to build houses to resettle internally displaced persons. “This is because every place has its own peculiarities of building their houses. “The houses you will build for the internally displaced persons in my state must be in conformity with the people’s culture and tradition and the location for building such houses matters a lot,” Masari said.

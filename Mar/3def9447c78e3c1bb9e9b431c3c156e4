President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Archbishop Henry Ndukuba on his presentation as the fifth Primate of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion). The President also felicitated with all members of the Anglican Church across Nigeria on the joyous occasion that ushered in a new spiritual leader of the Church, “who has vowed to uphold the tenets of the Christian faith as espoused in the teachings of Jesus Christ.” In a statement signed by Femi Adesina, his Spokesman, Buhari prayed for God’s grace, wisdom and guidance for the new leader as he “leads Anglicans in Nigeria at a time of contending myriad of challenges for the church, the nation and the world.” It added that the President “appreciates the contributions and solidarity of the Church in encouraging the faithful to adhere to government and public health authorities-led efforts to limit the transmission of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Underscoring the important relations between the Church and the State, and the roles of faith-based organizations in nation-building, President Buhari said he is confident that as a nation that believes in the efficacy of prayer and the power of faith in God, Nigeria will bounce back from this trying period through collective actions. The President also took the opportunity to wish the retired Primate, Archbishop Nicholas Okoh every success in his future mission. President Buhari “welcomes the new Primate to Abuja and assures him of good wishes and support as he begins a new phase of ministry,” the statement added.

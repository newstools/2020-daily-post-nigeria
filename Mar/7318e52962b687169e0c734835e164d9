Former England and Tottenham Hotspur striker, Clive Allen, has tested positive for Coronavirus (COVID-19). Allen contracted the deadly disease earlier this month after he suffered from headaches, fever, and dry cough. The 58-year-old, who scored 49 goals in the 1986-87 season for Tottenham, is currently in self-isolation in England. “Over the last two or three days, it took hold, and I felt unwell for five days, one day particularly so,” Allen told The Sun. “I had a nasty headache, which I have never got, and it was all around my head. “After I began to feel better and the later got dry cough for like three days. “Because there was information about coronavirus, then I called 111, and they told me that they would call me back in the next two to three days, which they did. “They came to my house three or four days later and tested. Health England arranged the whole thing, and the lady came and swabbed my nose and my mouth. “She went away with the sample, and I got the positive result [of COVID-19] five days later. “I thought I had a bad attack of flu, but, due to the timing of it, I was a little bit concerned because a lot was being talked about the coronavirus.”

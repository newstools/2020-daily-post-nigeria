Paul Pogba and David de Gea are among five players that could leave Manchester United this summer, the UK Mirror reports. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to rebuild his squad ahead of next season and Bruno Fernandes’ arrival from Sporting Lisbon, is seen as early steps in that direction. Solskjaer is believed to have the backing of United executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, and this will be reflected in the transfer market. However, the club want to reduce their wage bill and move on several players to make way for any potential new arrivals. Pogba will lead the exit, with the France midfielder linked with Real Madrid and Juventus. De Gea, United’s current number one, has not had a great season, making three errors leading to goals – the joint second most in the league. With Dean Henderson impressing on loan at Sheffield United, De Gea might be allowed to leave. Jesse Lingard has failed to register a single goal or an assist in his 20 Premier League appearances so far this term and will be asked to go. United will look for buyers for Alexis Sanchez, who is currently on loan at Inter Milan. Another player out on loan is Marcos Rojo, who has lost his place at Old Trafford, with Solskjaer preferring Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly ahead of him.

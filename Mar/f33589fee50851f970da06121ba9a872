Barely one month after the burial of the late senator Benjamin Uwajumogu, aspirants jostling for his replacement are increasing by the day. DAILY POST gathered that apart from the current Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba, who had earlier declared interest, a former Secretary to the Government of Imo state, Mark Uchendu has joined the race. It would be recalled that Chief Tony Chukwu, a leader in the zone, in a stakeholders meeting held recently at his residence in Ehime-mbano LGA, presented his choice candidate, Eze Okoro, insisting that the zone should not be held to ransom by one man. Further revelations indicate that Senator Ifeanyi Araraume’s return to APC was to have a better platform to emerging victorious in the forthcoming election since it is the ruling party in the state. Meanwhile, an apex sociopolitical organization in Okigwe, Mezie Okigwe Elders Council has called on the political leaders of the zone to close ranks and toe the line of peace in producing the next senator of the zone. The council, through her National President, Ben Okafor had earlier noted that it would be right that the late Senator’s LGA (Ihitte-Uboma) be given the chance to complete his tenure to further repose his soul. DAILY POST has further learnt that a former Senator of the zone, Athan Achonu including the immediate past Speaker of Imo State House of Assembly, Acho Ihim have also joined the race.

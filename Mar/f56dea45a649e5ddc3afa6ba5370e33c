DAILY POST reported that Martins slumped and died during one of the Nigeria Professional Football League fixtures on Sunday.

He wrote: “The death of Chineme Martins defender with the Nasarawa United FC during their match with Katsina United FC in Lafiya is tragic and a great loss. “May his soul Rest in perfect peace. My condolences to the @thenff, League Management Company, his team and family “If it was one Oyinbo that died in Barcelona, Madrid, Chelsea, ManU or Arsenal ah pesin no go hear word lai lai, some would not even eat dinner.”

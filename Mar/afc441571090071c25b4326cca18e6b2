Everton manager, Carlo Ancelotti, has been found guilty of improper conduct by the FA. Ancelotti accepted the misconduct charge issued to him, following his red card at the end of the 1-1 draw with Manchester United on Sunday. He was charged following the out burst with referee Chris Kavanagh, who asked Ancelotti to leave the pitch three times. The Italian has escaped a touchline ban, but will pay a £8,000 fine. “Carlo Ancelotti has been fined £8,000 for a breach of FA Rule E3 during the Premier League fixture against Manchester United FC on Sunday 1 March 2020. “The Everton FC manager admitted that his language and/or behaviour on the field of play at the end of the fixture amounted to improper conduct and also accepted the standard penalty,” an FA statement read. This means Ancelotti will be in the dugout when the Toffees face his former club Chelsea this weekend.

Barcelona on Saturday, confirmed in a post on their official website that their captain, Lionel Messi, has surpassed Juventus forward, Cristiano Ronaldo, to set a new goal record in Europe’s five biggest leagues after scoring against Real Sociedad. The Catalan club defeated Real Sociedad 1-0 in La Liga on Saturday, thanks to Messi’s late penalty to send them back to the top of La Liga table. Messi’s strike against Sociedad means the Argentine captain now has 438 goals in his 474th La Liga games. The 32-year-old now has a goal ahead of Ronaldo, who has scored 437 times in 540 games for Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus. Messi is now the all-time top scorer in the five major European leagues (EPL, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1). The Barca number 10 led the table until January 25, when Ronaldo overtook him with a goal against Napoli. Six weeks later, Messi leads the way again. Messi and Ronaldo have been the most prolific scorers in Europe of all time. The duo has been regularly competing with each other for individual honours. Messi has won six Ballon d’Ors, and Ronaldo has won five.

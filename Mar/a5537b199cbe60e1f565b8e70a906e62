The embattled National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, has accused the Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, of turning against him. Oshiomhole played a key role in Obaseki’s emergence, but both men have been at war since the governor indicated his interest in another term. There was celebration in Obaseki’s camp, after an FCT High Court in Jabi, Abuja, suspended Oshiomhole as APC’s National Chairman. However, 24 hours later, Justice Lewis Allagoa of the Federal High Court in Kano State, set aside the ruling that suspended him. Oshiomhole met with President Muhammadu Buhari after Allagoa’s judgement. Speaking to State House reporters after the meeting in Aso Rock, he said: “Let me also say that those behind this plot, the hands you saw, which includes as you saw yesterday the Edo state governor and his people jubilating but that is the irony of life. “You helped in giving birth to a child and the child looks for cutlass to chop off your neck. It has happened in history, it has happened in this country so I won’t be only person.”

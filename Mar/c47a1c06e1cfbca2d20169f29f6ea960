The Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania, Wang Ke has insisted that China has not exported any case of Coronavirus to Africa. Ke explained that the disease has not been exported from China to African countries because citizens have been educated on how to prevent the possible transmission of COVID-19. He stated that his country has canceled out bound tourists groups and that screening of passengers at all exit points of the country is done thoroughly amongst other measures. The Ambassador spoke during an extraordinary meeting on COVID-19 of Health Ministers of Southern African Development Community Member Countries at the Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre in Dar es Salaam. According to Ke: “Here I would like to commend my lovely compatriots, the 1.4 billion Chinese people. No matter they are healthcare personnel, community workers or volunteers who fight at the front-line, or ordinary citizens who quarantine at home, or overseas Chinese who make donations to their motherland to fight the disease, the exemplary contribution, self-discipline and unprecedented solidarity have won respect and appreciation from the world, which I am so proud of. “In the face of the epidemic, China also bravely assumes its international responsibility. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, China has been taking the prevention of overseas spread of the disease as its important task. “We have canceled all outbound tourist groups, strictly screened passengers at all exit ports across the country, and required all Chinese citizens going abroad to observe and follow the epidemic control measures, and quarantine themselves for two weeks upon their arrival at the destination countries. “No second country hit by the disease is taking these strict measures like China. It is because of these measures that although China had a serious situation in the past two months, it has up to date not exported a single case of COVID-19 to Africa.”

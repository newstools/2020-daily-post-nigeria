A former All Progressives Congress, APC, presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, has declared that Biafra is dead and buried. Garba urged pro-Biafra agitators to ignore the secession move and look for something better. He was reacting to the commendation that greeted the decision of the Senate Minority Leader, Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe to oppose the senate’s approval of $22.79bn external loan requested by President Muhammadu Buhari. Senate had approved the loan after a heated debate which led to a closed-door executive session. Speaking during the debate, Abaribe had tackled the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan for “shutting out the rest of the senate members on the approval of the loan.” Abaribe had said: “We are going to pass a loan of $22.7billion for which we are being denied the privilege to express our reservations. You are putting us in a very impossible position. “There are some aspect of this loan that we object to. I want to ask on behalf of our colleagues here that we take these items one by one and vote on them.” “I want to quote one popular saying that he who goes a borrowing, goes a borrowing.” However, Garba in a tweet, wrote: “Our brothers from the South East are happily celebrating Senator Abaribe for his effective representation, you know why? “Because he joined party politics, won election through the law. So he represents Most of you can too, just stop following the buried Biafra trust in Nigeria.”

Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp has blamed midfielder, Fabinho, for the first goal the Reds conceded against Chelsea following their FA Cup fifth-round 2-0 defeat on Tuesday night at Stamford Bridge. According to Klopp, the Brazilian international will have to live with the mistake he made that resulted in the first goal. Klopp’s side were knocked out from the competition after two goals from Willian and Ross Barkley. “With Fabinho, he had to play,” Klopp was quoted by Liverpool Echo as saying after the game. “He was the one who had to stay on the pitch and play the game. “You saw better rhythm, but he lost the ball for the first goal, and even an experienced player has to deal with that.” Liverpool will now take on Bournemouth in their next fixture in the Premier League this weekend.

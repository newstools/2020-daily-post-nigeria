Alex Iwobi and his Everton team-mates have been placed in self-isolation. This comes after a member of their first-team squad reported symptoms of the coronavirus. “Everton Football Club can confirm that, as a precautionary measure, its entire first-team squad and coaching staff are undertaking a period of self-isolation following medical advice,” a club statement read. “The step has been taken after a first-team player reported symptoms consistent with coronavirus. The Club is in regular contact with the player in question and is monitoring the wellbeing of all players and staff.” Everton were scheduled to host Liverpool in the Merseyside derby on Monday night, but the game is likely to be called off. Players of Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea are also under self-isolation.

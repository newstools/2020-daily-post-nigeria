The World Health Organisation, WHO, has confirmed that there are now over 300,000 cases worldwide. WHO director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who made the confirmation on Monday, said it took 67 days for the first 100,000 cases to be confirmed, 11 days for the next 100,000, and only four for the last 100,000.
Describing the development as ‘heartbreaking’, Ghebreyesus stated that the number of infections among doctors and care personnel is especially alarming.
“When the people who take care of the sick become ill themselves, many more people will die,’’ he warned.
He also called on Group of 20 countries to work together to ratchet up the production of protective gear. Tedros also said that those materials must be distributed fairly and arrive where they are needed most. NAN reports that the G20 includes the most important industrialised and emerging countries, which together account for over 80 per cent of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP). Meanwhile, Nigeria on Monday confirmed its first coronavirus death and 36th case. The victim is a 67-year-old man who returned to the country following medical treatment in the United Kingdom, UK. He was identified as a former Managing Director of Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC), Suleiman Achimugu.

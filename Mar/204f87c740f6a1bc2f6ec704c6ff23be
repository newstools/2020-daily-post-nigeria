Churches in Ogun have been directed to remain closed indefinitely until government says otherwise. The Ogun State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) on Friday, told churches in the state to shut down all activities totally to prevent a surge in cases of Coronavirus pandemic in the state. DAILY POST recalls that Gov Dapo Abiodun had earlier directed that no gathering, religious or secular, should have more than 20 persons. In compliance, the State Chapter Chairman of CAN, Bishop Tunde Akin-Akinsanya, in a statement, said: “Given the trying time the world contends with today, Christians should apply the Godly wisdom as enunciated in the book of Isaiah 26:20 and stay indoor for a while until the danger posed by the COVID-19 passes away.” Bishop Akin-Akinsanya also advised all members and church leaders to comply with government directives as well as those from the Ministry of Health, regarding measures to stay safe and prevent the spread of the ravaging viral disease.

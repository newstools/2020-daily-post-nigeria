Olga Diyachenko, girlfriend of former Super Eagles Captain, John Mikel Obi, has backed the midfielder’s decision to mutually terminate his contract at Trabzonspor. DAILY POST had reported on Tuesday that Mikel’s contract with Trabzonspor had been terminated by mutual consent. Mikel who joined Trabzonspor as a free agent on a two-year deal last summer, criticized the Turkish football authorities for not suspending the Super Lig season despite the coronavirus outbreak in Europe. Reacting to the development, Olga, in a tweet on her Instagram page on Tuesday night, wrote: “You are vile, but my man is a hero. Family over everything. Good friends show their love in times of trouble, not just in times of happiness, Euripides. “Thank you, Trabzonspor fans that understand, and for those who don’t, I’m sorry, but family first no matter what.” Mikel and Olga have two twin daughters, Ava and Mia, and have been together since 2012.

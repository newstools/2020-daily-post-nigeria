The Nigerian judicial system is said to be under serious threat given the array of injustices gradually becoming the norm in the country. Justice C. Uhuegbu, a lawyer and human right activist of note stated this recently in Owerri, Imo state capital while fielding questions with journalists. He said that the judiciary has so far proven that it contributes, to a large extent, the problems of the country, describing it as no longer the last hope of the common man as it was earlier ascribed. The 2019 Vice Presidential candidate regretted that so many well-meaning and good-spirited individuals who are ready to lead with the fear of God, have fallen victims of injustice. “There should be a total overhauling of the judicial system in our country. The judiciary is contributing to the problems of Nigeria and this portends great danger. “Yes I am a lawyer. That is not enough reason to bend the truth. You see, when we continue to keep silent over little issues, that is when the whole nation is doomed. “It is unfortunate that our institutions have been dragged into politics, especially in this administration of APC led by President Muhammadu Buhari.” Similarly, he condemned party politics, describing it as a menace gradually eating deep into the fabrics of most Nigerians. He appealed that politicians desist from using political offices to settle family, friends and well-wisher, a situation, he lamented has stagnated the country. Justice Uhuegbu, however, advised the Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodinma to also consider technocrats in his administration to achieve better result.

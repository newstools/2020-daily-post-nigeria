Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has said the club will support Bukayo Saka, no matter what country he chooses to represent. Saka is eligible to play for both Nigeria and England. The 18-year-old who is an out-and-out winger, has been played at left-back by Arteta, but has put in some impressive displays. Saka has netted four times and provided 10 assists in all competitions. There has been talk about the player becoming a subject of tussle between the two countries, as he becomes more prominent for the Gunners. “International level is a different level. It is up to the England manager to discuss whether he is ready to do that and what is he going to do with his squad. “Whatever he decides we will support the idea and the player,” Arteta said according to Football London.

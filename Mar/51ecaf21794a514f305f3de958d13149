The Chairman, Cross River State House of Assembly Committee on Health, Hon (Dr) Ekpo Ekpo Bassey has condemned the strike embarked upon by Medical Doctors in the State. The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) had declared industrial action in the State following the kidnap of the wife of one of their members, Mrs Christiana Ekanem. Mrs Ekanem had been in captivity since March 10, 2020 and the kidnappers demanded N30m. At the time of filling this report, the ransom has been reduced to N5m but the family and NMA had been unable to pay the sum. But the Chairman of the House Committee on Health, Hon (Dr) Ekpo Ekpo Bassey, speaking with DAILY POST via phone on Wednesday, said that the industrial action had yielded no positive results as the victim was still in captivity. “The call for industrial action protesting the abduction of the wife of their colleague is uncalled for and unnecessary. The Doctors should have realised the importance of their services to the health need of the people and make it a priority. “The action has no effect on the kidnappers; it is on the common people who need the services. As I speak to you, common people are dying in the State, the strike does not at any way address the problem of getting the woman out of captivity. “It is unfortunate that Doctors and NMA have not reported the matter officially to the Police, and the Police if they go for the rescue, and they are injured where we they be treated? “The NMA should review their stand again and quickly call off the strike and set a machinery to see how they can intervene in this process and get the woman released from captivity rather than embark on strike,” he stated. “The NMA has to call off the strike and allow members to handle the current Coronavirus plauging Nigeria and other health problems in the State,” he stated.

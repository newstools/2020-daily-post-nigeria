Chairman, Federal Inland Revenue Service, FIRS, Muhammad Nami has said some staff of the parastatal are graduates of engineering, law and others. He said this on Monday at a meeting with members of the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives. “On assumption of duty, I discovered that about 1,139 staff were recruited and posted to tax offices across the country to administer tax matters without adequate training. “Some of these people are graduates of engineering, law and other disciplines. They are not graduates of taxation”, Vanguard quoted Nami as saying. “But they were posted to administer tax for the government. We have begun the process of training these people in tax administration, as a way of improving our operations.” On Value Added Tax, VAT, Nami lamented that some companies were evading payment. He accused them of hiding under the clause in the Finance Act, which exempt companies below a certain threshold from paying VAT. Nami revealed that some companies now claimed that their capital base was less than N25 million.

The National Chairman of the main opposition Party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Prince Uche Secondus has felicitated with the Zamfara State Governor, Alhaji Bello Matawalle on his victory at the Supreme Court on Friday, urging him to be a good team leader. Prince Secondus reminded the Governor and the party in the state that their victory came from God as he urged the Governor and his team to appreciate this fact and work hard to make a lasting mark with the mandate. The National Chairman in a statement from his media office in Abuja, signed and made available to DAILY POST by Ike Abonyi, advised the Governor to unite the people and move quickly to tackle the myriad of challenges facing the state, most of which stems from bad governance witnessed in the state in the past. “God has designed this position for you for a purpose and you must do everything humanly possibly not to disappoint both the people and the almighty who sent you there,” Secondus said. “Identify critical stakeholders who can help you achieve your goals and refuse to be intimidated because you have a special mandate from God. Finally, Prince Secondus charged PDP members in the state to give the Governor all the needed cooperation and support to help him deliver good governance to the good people of Zamfara State.

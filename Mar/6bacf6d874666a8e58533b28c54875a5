Manchester United Manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has lost faith in Jesse Lingard and will approve his sale this summer, Goal reports. Lingard has been left out of United’s squad more frequently, following Bruno Fernandes’ arrival from Sporting Lisbon in January. The 27-year-old has failed to impress this season, scoring only twice in his last 35 appearances. Super agent Mino Raiola has now been tasked with securing him a move away. Lingard’s current contract with the Red Devils runs until 2021. United are ready to move for Jadon Sancho, Jack Grealish and James Maddison ahead of Solskjaer’s second full campaign, which would force Lingard further down the pecking order.

Bishop David Oyedepo, the founding Pastor of the Living Faith Church, has explained why he held services on Sunday, amid government’s ban on large gatherings. Oyedepo’s special assistant, Steve Ogah, in a statement, claimed it was to sensitize and mobilize their members over the coronavirus outbreak. Winners Chapel has been the subject of criticism from online and offline quarters, for going ahead with their services. Images and short clips from the service, showed that thousands of worshippers gathered inside the church auditorium. However, Ogah argues that the service was actually held with less than half of its usual congregation. He also noted that “The Bishop has since engaged Ogun State Government at the highest level to clarify this issue and any misgivings and reiterated the full support of the church for the State Government’s efforts to ensure public safety, towards curtailing the spread of this deadly virus. “The Church shall continue to engage all necessary logistics to ensure compliance with government directives and continue to pray for speedy divine intervention to stem this deadly virus.”

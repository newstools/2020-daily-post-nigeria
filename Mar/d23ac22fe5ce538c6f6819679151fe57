Lille forward, Victor Osimhen, has insisted he would have no qualms about Odion Ighalo returning to play for Nigeria. Ighalo retired from international football, after finishing as top scorer at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. The 30-year-old has been replaced in the Super Eagles by Osimhen. However, since Ighalo sealed a six-month loan deal with Manchester United, there have been renewed calls for him to play for Nigeria again. Speaking with OJBSPORTS, Osimhen hailed Ighalo as an inspiration and said he would be glad to learn from him. “Ighalo is welcome (to the national team). He did so well for us in AFCON and of course in the qualifiers. “He is welcome anytime. Whether I am on the bench or I’m starting, it will be very good for me to try and watch him play and try to help the team also. He is welcome anytime, for me to be on the bench or playing, I have no problem with that,” Osimhen said.

Even as the Federal Government moves to completely lock down the nation, the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria, IPMAN has made all contingency plans to sustain the supply and distribution of petroleum products across the country during this trying period of national emergency. The chairman of the Kano chapter of IPMAN, Alhaji Bashir Ahmad Danmallam made this known after an emergency meeting of the association in Kano. Alhaji bashir said IPMAN is duty bound to rise to the occasion and contribute their own quota in the fight against the deadly pandemic. “In Consideration of the pivotal role petroleum products play as the engine room of the economy, IPMAN as an essential service provider would keep all its outlets open for business to lessen the impact of the restrictions placed on people and businesses,” Bashir assured. The IPMAN chairman urged government to continue to open all access to petroleum products for lifting to marketers. IPMAN further urged the NNPC, DPR, PPPRA and PEF and other relevant stakeholders in the downstream sector of the industry to complement government efforts in facilitating smooth and efficient unbroken chain of supply and distribution of products seamlessly. It further urged all its members to adhere strictly to the advice and directives of health officials from the federal and state Ministry of Health and NCDC as well as local health officials. “Our members and indeed the public should pay attention to personal hygiene and ensure a safe social distance and to always wear face masks, hand gloves, wash hands with soap and sanitizer and to always keep wipes.”

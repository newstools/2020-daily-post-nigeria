The source said: “We observe with interest the recent series of successful attacks carried out by the Air Task Force (ATF) of Operation LAFIYA DOLE, where the female pilots play major roles in NAF Air Interdiction Operation codenamed DECISIVE EDGE. “They accomplished the sustained airstrikes sequel to Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions with accurate hits on the target areas. “The Women of War, in effective coordination with their male counterparts, have continued to provide intelligence, neutralize Boko Haram fighters, bomb ISWAP fuel storage/logistics facilities, destroy terrorists’ gun trucks and training camps. “In fact, in recent operations, they destroyed terrorists’ hideouts that are inaccessible to ground forces due to difficult and sometimes heavily mined terrain. Battle Damage Assessments have always confirmed their accurate hits on targets.” DAILY POST recalls that in celebration of the 2020 International Women’s Day, the Nigeria Air Force released a footage on the women’s contributions and sacrifices in ensuring a safe Nigeria.

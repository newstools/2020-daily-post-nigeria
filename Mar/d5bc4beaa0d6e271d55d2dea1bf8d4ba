The United States has named Amir Muhammad Sa’id Abdal-Rahman Al-Mawla, the new leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT). Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, made the declaration at a news briefing in Washington on Tuesday. Pompeo said Al-Mawla succeeded ISIS former leader, Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, who was killed in October 2019. In a statement, the Department of State said Al-Mawla was active in ISIS affiliate, al-Qai’da in Iraq, and steadily rose through the ranks to become the Deputy Amir. “Al-Mawla helped drive and attempt to justify the abduction, slaughter and trafficking of Yazidi religious minorities in northwest Iraq, and oversees the group’s global operations.” He said U.S. citizens will be generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with al-Mawla and that his property and interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction will be blocked. Popmpeo stated that the decision was part of a larger comprehensive effort to defeat ISIS. In June, 2013, the U.S. placed a $7million bounty on elusive Boko Haram leader, Shekau. On June 21, 2012, the world power designated Shekau a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224.

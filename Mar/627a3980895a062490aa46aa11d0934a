The Deeper Life Bible Church, has obeyed the directive placing a ban on worship centres. It held its Sunday’s service with less than 50 members and televised for other members. The General Overseer, Pastor W.F. Kumuyi, while preaching assured his members that God would not allow any plague come near those who truly believed in him. Kumuyi spoke on the topic, “Our redemption through the blood of the lamb.” The soft-spoken cleric, who anchored his message from Exodus 12:5, said “the blood of Jesus is strong enough to wash away every sin and disease.” Recall that the Lagos State Government had ban public gathering of not less than 50 people, following the scourge of Coronavirus.

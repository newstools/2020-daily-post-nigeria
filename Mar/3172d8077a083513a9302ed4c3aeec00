Manchester City midfielder, Bernardo Silva, has called on Pep Guardiola’s men not to repeat the same mistakes against Manchester United when they face Arsenal on Wednesday in the Premier League. The Portuguese international also wants the Citizen to check what is not going right in their squad presently. Silva was unable to help City as Man United defeated the Premier League champions at Old Trafford on Sunday after two goals from Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay. “We did not start badly and were playing quite well until we conceded,” Man City’s official website quoted Silva as saying after the match. “We know how good the Manchester United players are on the counter-attack, very aggressive. “We will have to watch the game back and listen to what Pep has to say. “Now, it is too close to know what was lacking. But a team like ours cannot lose as many games as we have lost so far this season. “We need to check what is not going right and try not to make so many mistakes going forward.” The match kick-off time is 8:30 pm, Etihad Stadium.

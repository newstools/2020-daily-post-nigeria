Former Paraguay striker, Nelson Cuevas, has said that Brazil legend, Ronaldinho, is ‘sad’ about his current situation after being jailed in prison for using false documents to enter Paraguay. Ronaldinho and his brother, Roberto, have been held in a police cell in Paraguay since March 5 for allegedly using false passports upon their arrival in Paraguay capital Asuncion. DAILY POST recalls that Lawyers representing the 39-year-old and Roberto filed an appeal last week, two days after another court rejected their request to release the duo on bail or house arrest. Cuevas, who visited the former attacking midfielder in prison, told Infobae: “Ronaldinho is sad. Hopefully, he can get out soon from the prison. “He is just sad because of the situation. “His lawyers are handling the rest. Hopefully, he can get out of there soon.” Ronaldinho will now return to court on Tuesday. The Barcelona legend is currently without a Brazilian passport because of an environmental fine he received back in 2018. Ronaldinho retired from active football in 2018.

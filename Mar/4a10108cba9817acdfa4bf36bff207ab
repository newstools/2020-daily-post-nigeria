Former Nigeria striker, Nwankwo Kanu, has called on Odion Ighalo to reverse his decision to retire from international football. Ighalo stepped away from the Super Eagles, after helping the team win bronze at the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Egypt. In January, the 30-year-old signed a six-month loan deal with Manchester United. Ighalo has now scored three goals in seven appearances for the Red Devils. Kanu has called for the Shanghai Shenhua frontman to be included in Gernot Rohr’s plans again. “Nigeria needs every good player no matter where they are playing or their age. “If he performs in Manchester United, we will ask him to come back and tell him to forget what he said. “This is football and we have to watch and see how the situation would unfold. Not just Ighalo, Nigeria need whoever is in form,” he told Goal.

Outspoken Nigerian cleric, Pastor Adewale Giwa has urged the people to perish the thoughts of having a President or a government that could respond effectively to their needs. Giwa, who is the presiding Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Jesus Christ Ministry, said he was not happy with the way the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal government had disappointed Nigerian citizens following the sit at home order. This was contained in a statement he signed and made available to DAILY POST on Monday. He said, “This period has further exposed President Buhari’s shameful selfish steak. They have left us to handle things on our own. “It is only a fool that will continue to think that we have a government. What is the essence of having a government that cannot protect the citizens? “We expect our government to provide for our well-being, rather, the reverse is the case. Go to America and other advanced countries, their citizens have filed for unemployment benefits during this global emergency. “Look at how they all responded effectively to make their people happy. Here in Nigeria, our citizens have occupied the social media to express their disappointments. “They are releasing billions of Naira to fight a disease but the citizens are going to bed hungry. “Take it or leave, some unscrupulous politicians are using this period of Coronavirus to enrich themselves and their family members. “God has a way of working things out for the hopeless people. God will vindicate His people and He will have compassion on his servants. “I want to appeal to individuals to show love to their neighbors during this hard time. We must support one another since they have left us to use our hands to measure our portion sizes.”

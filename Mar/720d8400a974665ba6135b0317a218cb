A Federal High Court in Abuja, on Monday, criticised the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) over its prosecution of former Comptroller General, Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Abdullahi Dikko. The ICPC is prosecuting Dikko and two others for alleged N1.1bn corrupt practice. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu told the ICPC Counsel, Ebenezer Shogunle, that the commission was not serious in the handling of the matter, NAN reports. Dikko, alongside Garba Makarfi, a former Assistant Comptroller-General of Customs, in charge of Finance, Administration and Technical Services, Umar Hussaini, a lawyer and owner of Capital Law firm are defendants in the case. The trio, among others, accused of inducing the Managing Director of Cambial Limited, Yemi Obadeyi, to pay N1.1 billion into the account of Capital Law Office. The fund is alleged to be a refundable “completion security deposit” for the purchase of 120 units of duplexes as residential accommodation for officers of the NCS.

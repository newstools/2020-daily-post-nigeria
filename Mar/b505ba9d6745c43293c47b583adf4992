Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, has urged President Muhammad Buhari to prove to Nigerians that he is well and in charge of the country’s affair by addressing the citizens on a national live broadcast as COVID-19 (coronavirus) continue to spread across the nation. Fani-Kayode wants President Buhari to show true leadership and address the good people of Nigeria in this period of the coronavirus pandemic. The former minister said this while reacting to President Buhari’s behind closed doors meeting with Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, and Director General of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) Chikwe Ihekweazu, at the Presidential Villa on Saturday. The meeting was held amidst calls for President Buhari to address Nigerians in a live telecast. Fani-Kayode, in a tweet on his official Twitter page, wrote: “Stop posting pretty pictures, show true leadership & ADDRESS your people. Prove you are well & that you are still in charge. That is the way to settle this matter. “Why are you scared of national broadcast? Do you have something to hide, or is it just CONTEMPT for your people? Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in Nigeria as it stands is 89, according to NCDC.

John Obi Mikel’s contract with Trabzonspor has been terminated by mutual consent, the club has announced. Mikel joined the Turkish club as a free agent on a two-year deal last summer. No reason was given for the mutual termination of the contract, but Trabzonspor confirmed the former Super Eagles captain gave up his remaining wages. “The professional football player agreement between our company and John Obi Mikel on 30.06.2019 start date 31.05.2021 has been mutually terminated. “With a mutual termination agreement, the football player gave up all his forward-looking receivables,” the statement read. Last weekend, Mikel Obi criticised Turkish football authorities, for not suspending the Super Lig season despite the spread of the coronavirus across Europe. The Nigerian then refused to come off the bench for their 1-1 draw with Istanbul Basaksehir.

The immediate past Senator for Imo East senatorial district, Samuel Nnaemeka Anyanwu has reacted to his purported expulsion from the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in Imo State, describing the state Secretary of the party as lacking in powers to sack him. The Senator was reacting to a recent publication in one of the local tabloids where the state Secretary of the PDP signed for his sack without the signatures of other executive members of the party including the state chairman. He said the publication was carried out by an overzealous individual who was merely envious of his (Samdaddy’s) towering popularity both in the state and national level of the party. Meanwhile, he has stated that it is only the National Working Committee of the PDP led by Uche Secondus that reserves the right and powers to expelled him, calling on people to disregard the news in its entirety. He said he is still a strong member of the PDP and will continue to contribute his quota towards the growth of the party. The Senator’s position was contained in a refutal written by one of his aides, Joshua Chibuzom.

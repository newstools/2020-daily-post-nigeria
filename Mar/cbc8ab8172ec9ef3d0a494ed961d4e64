The Nigerian Infectious Diseases Society has tasked the federal and state governments to as much as possible follow reasonable and evidence-based guidance of the WHO in the face of COVID-19 They have asked relevant health authorities to extend surveillance for suspected COVID-19 cases to land and sea borders as the likelihood of importation of the virus to Nigeria is not limited to air travels alone. The health body made the call in reaction to Nigeria’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic in a statement signed by its president, Prof. Dimie Ogoina Prof. Ogoina noted that the coronavirus outbreak is a global health, socioeconomic and diplomatic challenge. He expressed fear that most states of the Federation may not be adequately prepared to respond to the outbreak if more cases are reported, especially outside Lagos. Prof. Ogoina further advised the government to extend COVID-19 testing laboratories to all states of the federation or at least a minimum of one laboratory per geopolitical zone. ‘‘We advise the general public and healthcare workers to adopt established prevention measures from verifiable and reliable sources’’.
‘‘We implore all stakeholders to follow evidence-based scientific guidelines and eschew fear and panic’’ Prof. Ogoina said Recall that the Federal Ministry of Health on Saturday announced the confirmation of 10 new cases of COVID-19. Health Minister, Dr. Ehanire said 7 of the 10 new cases were in Lagos while the other 3 are in Abuja. He assured that all 10 cases were receiving treatment at designated health facilities in Abuja and Lagos respevtively.

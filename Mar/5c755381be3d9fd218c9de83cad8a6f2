Bruno Fernandes has been named Manchester United Player of the Month for March, ahead of Odion Ighalo and Harry Maguire. Ighalo netted three times and provided one assist this month. His goals included a brace against Derby County in the FA Cup and one against LASK in the Europa League. Ighalo is yet to find the back of the net in the Premier League. Fernandes, who has also been in top form since his arrival at Old Trafford, however won the accolade. The Portugal midfielder has scored three times since he arrived at United in January.

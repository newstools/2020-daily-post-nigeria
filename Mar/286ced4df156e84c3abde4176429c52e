UEFA president, Aleksander Ceferin, has insisted that Manchester City remain a valued “asset” in their competitions, despite handing the Premier League champions a two-year ban. City were handed the suspension by UEFA’s Club Financial Control Body, for allegedly breaking financial fair play rules. The Etihad club has since lodged an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport [CAS]. Ceferin, speaking with Sky Sports, refused to comment on the case. “I cannot comment [on] Manchester City, or any other case, out of two reasons. “One reason is because I don’t know anything about it and the second is, it’s not correct for a president to comment [on] the case that is dealt by an independent body. So, absolutely impossible to say anything more,” he said.

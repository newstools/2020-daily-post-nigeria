The Lagos State House of Assembly has impeached and replaced two principal officers. The change of guard took place Monday evening hours after the affected officers were sacked. The House, after plenary, unanimously elected Noheem Adams (Eti-Osa constituency 1) as the new Deputy Majority Leader; Mojisola Miranda (Apapa constituency 1) is the new Chief Whip. Before their election, Noheem was the chairman of the Committee on Public-Private Partnerships while Miranda headed the committee on Job Creation. The members had removed Olumuyiwa Jimoh as the Deputy Majority Leader and Rotimi Abiru as the Deputy Chief Whip after a voice vote. Similarly, the House moved against two members Moshood Oshun (Mainland Constituency 2) and Kazeem Raheem Adewale (Ibeju Lekki Constituency 2). They were suspended indefinitely for alleged gross misconduct and other infractions said to be against the rules guiding the House and its operations. The Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, relied on the provisions of the House’ Rules and Standing Order. Obasa noted that as lawmakers, the duo derailed from being “the hope of the people” in their conduct. “It is on this note that I invoke Orders 68, 71, (4)(a)(b)(11) and (111) of the Rules and Standing Order of the House in respect of gross misconduct and insubordination, actions that can destabilise the House”, he said.

Ondo State Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, has debunked reports that he was on self-isolation after insinuations that he might have had contact with those who had tested positive to deadly coronovirus. Akeredolu, who appeared at a press briefing Wednesday evening alongside the State Commissioner of Police, Undie Adie, said he would not have come out if he were on self-isolation. Talks about Governor Akeredolu’s self-isolation were riffed after he cancelled all official engagements including courtesy calls and other engagements already approved and scheduled for a period of 14 days in the first instance. Governor Akeredolu said the meeting with the Commissioner of Police was to ensure strict compliance with the closure of markets and other directives he issued as ways of curbing spread of the coronavirus. The Ondo Police boss said only those selling essential things like pharmaceuticals, food and water would be allowed to sell. Adie said his men would ensure total compliance and urged those dealing in non-essential goods to stay at home for the period COVID-19 would be contained. “Life will soon return to normal. Those selling food should ensure there are no crowds. We should endeavour to maintain social distancing.”

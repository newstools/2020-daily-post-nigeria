The wife of Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Sophie Grégoire, has tested positive for coronavirus. This was contained in a statement Thursday night from the Prime Minister’s Office. It, however, clarified that the PM was “in good health with no symptoms.” Trudeau has been placed in 14 days isolation as a precautionary measure. The wife was said to be “feeling well, taking the recommended precautions and her symptoms remain mild”. The office had earlier Thursday announced that Grégoire was tested for the coronavirus after flu-like symptoms. “Following medical recommendations, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau was tested for Covid-19 today. The test came back positive. Also following medical advice, she will remain in isolation for the time being,” it read. The deadly disease has killed 5,000 people out of 135,000. About 100 countries have been affected. On March 11, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared coronavirus a global pandemic.

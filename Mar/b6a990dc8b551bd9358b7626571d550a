Arsenal on Thursday provided the latest update on manager, Mikel Arteta’s health condition after the Spaniard tested positive for Coronavirus. DAILY POST had reported last week that Arteta tested positive for Coronavirus. News that Arteta and Chelsea forward, Callum Hudson-Odoi had contracted COVID-19, forced the English Premier League (EPL) to put the English top-flight league on hold until April 4 and now 30. Providing an update on Arteta’s condition, Arsenal said in a statement on their official website: “Our training centres in London Colney and Hale End were closed for deep cleaning after Mikel’s diagnosis with the virus but have now reopened with a small workforce to maintain the facilities and training pitches. “Some number of staff, including Mikel and the men’s first-team squad, are currently isolating at home. “We’re pleased to say that Mikel is feeling much better. He’s in good spirits, doing detailed planning with the coaches and speaking to the players regularly.”

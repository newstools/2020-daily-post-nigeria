Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk has reacted to his side’s UEFA Champions League round of 16 second-leg defeat against Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night. According to Van Dijk, it was a big blow for Jurgen Klopp’s men to be knocked out of the competition after winning it last year. Diego Simeone’s men defeated Liverpool at Anfield to qualify for the quarter-finals on 4-2 aggregate, thanks to Marcos Llorente’s brace and Alvaro Morata’s strike as two goals from Georginio Wijnaldu and Roberto Firmino was not enough to save the host. Speaking after the game, Van Dijk told Liverpool’s official website:
“Getting out of the Champions League is a big blow, especially when we were in the final two years ago and last year we won it. At this stage we were close. “The played well the full 95 minutes and were brilliant. We put Atletico under pressure just like we wanted. “We created good chances, the only thing was that they had quite a good goalkeeper in their team, so that’s also part of football.” Liverpool’s next fixture is against Everton in the Premier League on March 16.

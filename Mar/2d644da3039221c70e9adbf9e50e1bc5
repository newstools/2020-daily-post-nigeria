Sequel to the continued measures taken to curb the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) in the country as well as protecting residents of Ondo State from the dreaded killer disease, the Ondo State Local Government Elections scheduled to hold on April 18, 2020 has been postponed indefinitely. Disclosing this on Friday, the Chairman, Ondo State Electoral Commission, ODIEC, Prof. Yomi Dinakin said that all 10 participating political parties in the already scheduled election agreed to the postponement. According to the ODIEC boss, the postponement became necessary as none of the parties will be able to hold any campaign rallies due to the ban on political and social gatherings across the state over the coronavirus development. Prof. Dinakin said the preparedness of the commission might be jeopardized by unforeseen circumstances during the conduct of the elections, stressing that it might be difficult to control the electorate on election day. As regards a new date for the elections, Prof Dinakin said the commission would monitor state government activities and announcements. He expressed optimism that the federal government would also postpone the implementation of its policy that all local councils in the country must have elected officials by May this year.

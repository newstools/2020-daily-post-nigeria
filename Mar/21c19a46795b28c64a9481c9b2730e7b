The World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned against the usage of popular drug ibuprofen without consulting a doctor. WHO spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, issued the warning at a news conference in Geneva on Tuesday. Lindmeier said the agency has no recent studies that link the anti-inflammatory drug with increased mortality rates. He, however, added that experts are currently investigating the matter. “We recommend paracetamol, not ibuprofen in self-medication,’’ Lindmeier said. Lindmeier also confirmed that two WHO staff members have been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus that causes COVID-19 respiratory disease. Coronavirus since its outbreak in Wuhan, China has claimed 6,000 lives and affected about 150 countries, including 27 in Africa.

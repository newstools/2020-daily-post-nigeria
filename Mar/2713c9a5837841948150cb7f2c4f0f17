A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Osagie Ize-Iyamu has commended President Buhari and Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the APC for foiling an alleged coup attempt against Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the party. Ize-Iyamu, who is a governorship aspirant on the platform of the APC in Edo state said some people used Edo State resources to push for Oshiomhole’s removal as APC National Chairman. Speaking in Benin, the Edo State capital while addressing Edo APC leaders and members, the governorship aspirant said he was very grateful, as Oshiomhole’s removal would have been shameful and disappointing. “President Buhari, Asiwaju Tinubu and other leaders of APC deserve commendation for foiling a coup, which was the product of a grand conspiracy, coordinated and funded from Edo State, for the removal as National Chairman of APC, an Edo son, Comrade Oshiomhole. “You can imagine a situation where few Edo indigenes were spending Edo people’s money to pay some people to remove an eminent son of the state as the National Chairman of APC. “Edo people are not ingrates. We appreciate the people who stood by us in times of need. We do not want the attitude of a few persons to give a wrong signal, because gratitude is in our DNA.” Recall that Oshiomhole and the governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki have been involved in a face-off over who leads the party at the state level. The alleged face-off took a different turn recently when Obaseki threatened to suspend Oshiomhole from the party at the state level. However, the APC National Chairman had insisted that he was not fighting anybody. Oshiomhole, was recently suspended by a Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court but the ruling was vacated by a Kano Federal High.

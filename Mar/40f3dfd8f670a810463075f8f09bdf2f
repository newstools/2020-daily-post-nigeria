Nigeria’s Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, has confirmed that two of the three suspected cases of coronavirus tested negative. Speaking at a news conference in Abuja on Friday, Ehanire said the result for the third person was not ready yet. “As of the three cases, one of them, we are expecting the result; it takes some hours for the results to come out. “We must go away from the idea of focusing on Chinese or any particular nationality because a case that entered Nigeria, which is the index case is not Chinese,” the Minister said. Yesterday, the Lagos State Commissioner of Health, Akin Abayomi, revealed that three patients have been put in isolation for tests. The three unnamed people flew into the country from France, China and England respectively.

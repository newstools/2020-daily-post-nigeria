The Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) has threatened strike over delay in the payment of their new minimum wage. Salaam Abdussobur, National Public Relations Officer, in a statement on Monday, said while workers in other sectors were already enjoying the new wage, the federal government has abandoned university workers. It noted that with the conclusion of the negotiations on the wage, SSANU expected an implementation would be seamless. “Unfortunately, however, months after the agreements were concluded and dusted, it seems the workers in the university system have been forgotten in the scheme of things”, it said. “While workers in other sectors have started enjoying the increment in the salaries, the university system has not. “Sadly, prices of goods and services immediately shot up as soon as the minimum wage was implemented, thereby causing financial hardships and difficulties for our members,” it read. SSANU lamented that there has not been any explanation from the government why the payment was delayed. “As a consequence, our members are becoming increasingly restive and agitated over the obvious neglect of the university sector in the implementation of the national minimum wage act.” SSANU called on the government to pay its members the new wage regime and payment of its arrears without further delay. The body said they have been patient enough and have shown great understanding with government on many of its policies. SSANU warned that the understanding and patience should not be at the expense or to the detriment of members’ welfare and incomes. “With the situation of things, it is becoming clearer to us that except an industrial action is undertaken, the new national minimum wage may never be implemented in the university system. “We hereby sound a note of warning to ensure the immediate payment of the minimum wage in order to guarantee industrial peace in the university system,” the statement added.

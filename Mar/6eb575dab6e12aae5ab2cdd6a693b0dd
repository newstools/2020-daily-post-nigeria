Prof Jesse A.Otegbayo, Chief Medical Director of the University College Hospital, UCH, Ibadan has tested positive for Coronavirus. Otegbayo made this known in a statement he personally released on Sunday. The doctor said his test became necessary after a colleague tested positive to the virus. He added that he is already self-isolating as he is not having any symptom yet. “On Monday 23rd March, we commenced a 12-man quarterly board meeting which was meant to last 5 days in the hospital, we observed social distancing and other precautionary measures for covid-19 as much as possible. “However, on Wednesday morning, one of us presented with what appeared to be symptoms of covid-19, his samples were immediately taken for test and the meeting called off. “His results returned positive on Friday morning and every participant (including me) immediately went into self-isolation while our samples were also taken for test. “Unfortunately, my result returned positive on Saturday afternoon and I remain in isolation as I am not symptomatic. All staff who have been in contact with me and other participants during this period have been advised to immediately proceed on self-isolation pending the time they get tested. He, therefore, urged Nigerian to take preventive measures because Covid-19 is spreading faster than we think. The cases in Nigeria in the past few days have been on a rapid increase. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, had confirmed that there are 97 cases of patients with COVID-19 with one death in the country.

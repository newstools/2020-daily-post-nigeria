The Kogi State Governor, Alhaji Yahaya Bello has attributed the delay in conducting local government council elections to paucity of funds in the last four years. Governor Bello stated this on Thursday in Lokoja, when he inaugurated three commissions, namely Kogi State Independent Electoral Commission, KOSIEC, Kogi State Hajj commission and Kogi State Judicial Service Commission. Inaugurating the commissions at Government House in Lokoja, Bello urged the newly constituted SIEC members to discharged their duties without fear or favour. He noted that what he had done was constitutional, stressing that those he appointed were based on merit saying they are men of integrity. The Governor urged them not to be biased, but rather give every contestant a chance and be plain while conducting election. According to him “You are not card carrier of any political party, nobody will interfere into your activities, every political party is very relevant and important in the state and as such you are expected to treat them equally and transparently. “You should not look at any body’s face while discharging your duties, you are expected to conduct a free, fair and credible election that will be adjudged as the best in the history of the state,” the governor charged them.

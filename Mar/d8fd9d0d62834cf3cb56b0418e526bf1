The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), on Friday, warned against the use of illicit and distribution of psychotropic substances. They include stimulants, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, mood stabilizers, anti-anxiety agents. NDLEA Commander in Imo, Nse Inam, warned non-professional individuals in medicine should steer clear of sales and distribution of drugs. Inam, represented by the Assistant Commander, Operations and Intelligence, Kayode Raji, spoke at a workshop organised for members of the Nigerian Association of Patent and Proprietary Medicine Dealers (NAPPMED). The official described the role of NAPPMED in the sale and distribution of medicine as “non-negotiable” especially in rural areas with little or no accessibility to adequate health care. NAN reports that he commended the association for supporting the NDLEA in the discharge of its constitutional responsibilities. Inam said that there was need to empower NAPPMED with relevant knowledge so as to enable them serve the people better. He called for strict adherence to relevant laws of the land. “NAPPMED is the closest to the people especially in the rural areas where it is difficult to access tertiary, secondary or primary health care services. “This is why we think that NAPPMED has a crucial role to play in this regard and should be empowered with knowledge of drugs such as psychotropic so as to mitigate the possibility of abuse.”

The Acting National Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, Chief Victor Giadom has said the party will respect the intervention of President Muhammadu Buhari in the crisis rocking the party. The acting National Secretary led National Working Committee (NWC) last week insisted that the emergency National Executive Committee meeting will hold as planned. Giadom, however, made U-turn following the intervention of the President that led to the indefinite suspension of the meeting. Following the report on Buhari’s intervention, Giadom said, “the decision of the President, who is the leader of the party and in that regards the NEC meeting slated for 17th March has been postponed indefinitely,” The Nation quoted him as saying. “The party will respect the intervention of Mr. President,” he added. On a new date for the NEC meeting, he added, “the public and members of NEC will be informed of the new date, but as for today and agreement with the President, the NEC meeting is postponed.” Meanwhile a Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court, on Monday granted an interim order declaring Giadom to act as the party’s National Chairman. This happened few hours after President Buhari had intervened in the party crisis, postponing the emergency NEC called by Giadom.

The suspended national chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole has appealed the Abuja High Court’s decision to suspend and deny him access to party’s national secretariat of the party. DAILY POST recalls that Oshiomhole was suspended on Wednesday following an application filed by Oluwale Afolabi in January before Justice Danlami Senchi. The interlocutory injunction application was challenging Oshiomhole’s continued right to parade himself as the party’s national chairman after his initial suspension by his primary ward in Edo State. But Oshiomhole’s suspension came amidst a power tussle between him and his successor, the Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki. It would be recalled that the tussle has created factions within the ruling party in the state and continues to threaten the party’s unity at the national level. However, some party leaders have criticised Oshiomhole’s leadership style, blaming it on the APC’s defeat in some states during the last general elections. In the disclosed appeal documents, Oshiomhole has challenged the court ruling that suspended him. The defendants in the case include Mustapha Salihu, the deputy chairman of the party (North-East)

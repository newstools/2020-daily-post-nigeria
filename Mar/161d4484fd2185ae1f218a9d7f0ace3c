The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has expressed sadness over the renewed attack in Kerewa village which led to death of over 50 persons on Sunday. The National Publicity Secretary of NCF, Alhaji Muhammad Ibrahim in a statement issued on Tuesday in Kaduna and made available to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) described the killing of over 50 persons by the bandits as callous and inhuman. The ACF said that the killing of innocent people, for whatever reason, could not, in any way, address the perceived concerns or grievances of the perpetrators of the crimes. The forum begged those aggrieved persons perpetrating such heinous act to always channel their grievances through the appropriate authorities rather than taking the law into their own hands. The forum also called on the security agencies to always be proactive in their operations to avert such incidence. “Furthermore, intelligence gathering and sharing should be a continuous exercise by both the community and the security agencies to ensure security of lives and property,” it said. ACF commended the efforts of the Kaduna state government and the security agencies in taking prompt and decisive action aimed at tracking the bandits and bringing them to book. The ACF sent its condolence to the affected communities in Igabi and Giwa council areas, the government and people of Kaduna State “We equally appeal to Kaduna State government and public-spirited individuals to provide relief materials to the affected communities,” it added.

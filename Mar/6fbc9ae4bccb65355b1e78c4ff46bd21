Former Liverpool and Real Madrid star, Michael Owen, has predicted the outcome of the FA Cup fifth-round match between Manchester United and Derby County. Derby County will on Thursday night host Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side at the iPro Stadium. Phillip Cocu’s men head to the game after defeating Sheffield Wednesday 3-1 in the Championship last weekend, while United played a 1-1 draw with Everton in the Premier League. “Since his arrival at Derby County from DC United, Wayne Rooney has been a key influence on and off the field for the Championship side,” Owen wrote in his Betvictor column. “Some fans at Old Trafford wished that Rooney had come back to Manchester United instead. “The Man United legend will be keen to torment his old club as they visit Pride Park on Thursday night. “However, since the arrival of Bruno Fernandes at Old Trafford, the Red Devils have looked much more convincing in possession, and I see them making it an unhappy reunion for Rooney.” The kick-off time for the match is 8:45 pm, Nigerian time.

The Israeli Ambassador to Nigeria, Shimon Ben-Shoshan, says his country was prepared to cooperate with Nigeria in the fight against Boko Haram and terrorism. Ben-Shoshan said this when he visited the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, on Tuesday in Abuja. He disclosed that Israel and Nigeria had maintained a cordial diplomatic relationship for 60 years. “We are willing to cooperate in any field. As you already know, there have been fantastic cooperation during the previous administration in fighting Boko Haram terrorists. “I can assure you that you are in good hands,” Ben-Shoshan said. The envoy stated that Israel had fought many wars over the years, adding that the country was desirous of achieving peace with all its neighbours. On peace with other nations, Ben-Shoshan said: “We are praying three times a day, we are asking for peace. I think it is better if we can solve the problem without using force which is the best thing to be done to save lives,” he said. Ben-Shoshan also expressed the desire of Israeli top government functionaries to visit Nigeria during the year, adding that no top official of government had paid official visit in a long time. In his remarks, Buratai said issue of security requires not only internal resources or internal forces. “We have had external supports in terms of training, provision of intelligence, which Israel has the strength. “Israel is highly sophisticated in information technology as well as cyber warfare and cyber intelligence which I believe Israel will use to support our armed forces.”

Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, has urged everyone to come together to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. Pogba, who turned 27 on Sunday reiterated the thoughts of many and maintained that human life comes first. Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, emanated from China but Europe is now at the centre of the outbreak. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has since declared the disease a global pandemic. Major sporting activities worldwide has now been put on hold to prevent the spread of the dreaded disease. “It is my birthday and I am always grateful that me, my family and friends are healthy,” Pogba posted on Instagram on Sunday. “Nonetheless, not everybody is in good health right now. The coronavirus pandemic is affecting the health and lives of many, including children. “The impact of a large-scale outbreak, especially on poor and vulnerable children, can be immense. UNICEF is helping prevent the spread of coronavirus by supplying vital medical supplies, consulting with communities and implementing prevention campaigns. “It is a priority to stop the spread of this new virus, and the misinformation that’s spreading alongside it. At times like this we need to come together.”

The Kaduna Electricity Distribution Company has advised consumers under its franchise to use the digital payment channels to settle their electricity bills. The company’s head of corporate communications Abdulazeez Abdullahi, who made the disclosure in a press statement on Wednesday in Kaduna, said the directive would enable electricity consumers avoid the crowd at the Company’s cash centres. Abdullahi said the advice was in response to calls by medical experts on social distancing as part of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. He advised customers to use any of the company’s online payment platforms to pay bills and purchase electricity token from the comforts of their homes or offices. The company’s spokesperson advised electricity users who may have any complaint to use the Company’s Customer Relationship Management (CRM) portal lodge such complaints, assuring that the complaint shall be attended to with dispatch. “As a responsible corporate body, we are concerned about the safety of every Nigerian.”

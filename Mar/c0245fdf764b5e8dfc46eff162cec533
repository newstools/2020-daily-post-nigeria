Kogi State Government has ordered civil servants on Grade Level 1 – 13 to stay off offices for 14 days. The state Commissioner for Information and Communication, Mr Kingsley Fanwo, who made this known in a statement on Monday in Lokoja said the directive takes effect from Monday, March 23. Fanwo said this was part of government efforts to prevent the spread of Coronavirus in the state. “Only workers from GL 1 to 13 are affected by the directive to stay at home while GL 14 and above are to report at their offices. “Those rendering essential services are to continue to go to their workplaces as they are not affected by the work from home directive,” Fanwo said. He further stated that the directive will be subjected to review after the first week. “The state government is leaving no stone unturned to ensure the virus does not find its way to the state and if it does, the government is prepared to control and manage it,” the statement said. Fanwo, therefore, urged residents to ensure adherence to health instructions released by the state’s Ministry of Health on how to prevent the disease as well as ensure personal hygiene.

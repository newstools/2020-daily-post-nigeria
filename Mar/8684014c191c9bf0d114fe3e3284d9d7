Popular Nigerian music legend, Innocent Idibia, a.k.a 2Baba has called on Nigerians not to panic but rather observe precautionary measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. The legend, who gave this advice in a video clip on his Instagram page @2babaofficial, said that Nigerians should develop the habit of washing their hands regularly. “Stay safe my people. Let’s not go into panic mode because all we need to do is simple. “Wash hands with soap regularly. Stay clean. Minimize social contact.” He further stated that everybody should take the Coronovirus pandemic seriously, adding that it only required hygiene and social distancing to curtail the virus. The singer added that even after this pandemic comes to an end, Nigerians should not relent but continue to wash their hands always. Recall that the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) on Friday confirmed 11 new cases. It said “11 new cases of #COVID19 have been reported in Nigeria: 8 in Lagos, 2 in Enugu & 1 in Edo State.” Nigeria now has 81 confirmed coronavirus cases.

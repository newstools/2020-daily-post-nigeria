The Abia State House of Assembly, on Tuesday, screened and confirmed the nomination of Prof Mkpa Agu Mkpa as Chairman, Abia State Independent Electoral Commission (ABSIEC). The screening, which took place in the executive session of the Assembly, was presided over by the Speaker, Rt Hon Chinedum Enyinnaya Orji. In his chat with newsmen after the screening, Prof Mkpa expressed satisfaction with the quality of questions thrown at him by the lawmakers. He warned anyone nursing the idea of trying to compromise the Commission to jettison such idea and test their popularity in the field, as the commission under his leadership would remain forthright in the discharge of its duties. Mkpa also confirmed that he was not a card carrying member of any political party and that those who were alleging so because of the offices he held in the past were mistaking his service to the State to mean service to a political party. “They are two different things”, he quipped. He challenged anyone with any evidence that he belongs to any political party to come forward with such evidence. “I have a job to do, to ensure we conduct elections that are free, fair and credible, and that is my focus,” he said, warning those with forged certificates not to bother coming forward to stand for elective positions because “we will find them out”. The State governor, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, had on Friday last week nominated Prof Mkpa Agu Mkpa as Chairman of the Abia State Independent Electoral Commission (ABSIEC) and subsequently sent his name to the Abia State House of Assembly for confirmation as required by law.

The Lagos State House of Assembly, on Tuesday, passed the bill on Amotekun, a security outfit of the South West. The lawmakers agreed to the passage unanimously. The bill was passed after the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Mudashiru Obasa, and his colleagues read it for the third time. It seeks to unify the proposed law that would guide the security outfit jointly established by the South West governors. Earlier in his remarks, Obasa said: “I’m sure we all recall the incidents before the establishment of Amotekun, the killings, maiming, kidnapping and their likes”. “In the wisdom of our governors, they decided on Amotekun. Our race has spoken and we must stand by it but in line with the constitution”. Also on Tuesday, the Oyo State House of Assembly passed the Amotekun bill named Oyo State Security Network Agency Bill 2020.

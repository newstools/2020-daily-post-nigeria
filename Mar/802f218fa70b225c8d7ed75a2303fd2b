Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, came under fire from former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand, after his side were eliminated from the Champions League on Tuesday night. Spurs who lost the first leg of the last-16 clash 1-0, were hammered 3-0 in Germany. Mourinho has now overseen a six-game winless run in all competitions. Speaking on BT Sport, Ferdinand explained how the Portugese coach has damaged the confidence of his players. “You’ve got to build them up and give them confidence. Talking about going to a gun fight without bullets – what does that do to the confidence of the likes of Dele, Lucas Moura? “That hasn’t been forthcoming from Jose. You see a hint of that in the performance tonight,” Ferdinand said.

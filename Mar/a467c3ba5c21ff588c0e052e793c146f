The Ekiti State Commissioner for Health, Dr Mojisola Yaya-Kolade, said on Tuesday that the index case in isolation in Ekiti State, has been discharged having recovered. Yaya-Kolade said, “He has tested negative. Everything is normal, we cannot keep him any longer”. The commissioner said, “What we told him, is that when he gets home, he should still self-isolate and if he is going out, he should wear mask”. She said that the contacts in isolation would be there for the prescribed 14 days, adding, however, that all of them were stable without any symptom. Yaya-Kolade said that the female care-giver of the late American, who had been in isolation “has done the test three times, and she is negative”.

Manchester United will extend Odion Ighalo’s deal until June 30, Sky Sports reports. Ighalo’s six-month agreement with United is to end May 31. However, it is now likely to be extended, because of the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Ighalo’s parent club, Shanghai Shenhua, expect the former Super Eagles striker to return after his loan stay at Old Trafford finishes. United also have the option to buy the 30-year-old on a permanent deal once his loan expires. Ighalo has netted four times in three starts for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s team.

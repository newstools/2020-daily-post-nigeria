The Modibbo Adama University of Technology (MAUTECH) Yola is to commence admission of students into the Medicine and Surgery undergraduate programme of the 2020/2021 academic session. This followed approval by the National Universities Commission (NUC) and conveyed to the institution by the Executive Secretary of the commission, Prof Abubakar Rasheed. The NUC boss has further directed the Vice-Chancellor of the university, Prof Abdullahi Liman Tukur, to immediately appoint a provost to manage the medical school. A press release statement signed by the Information Officer of the university, Malam Aminu Gurumpawo, said that in preparation for the medical college takeoff, the university has designated the newly completed central laboratories and another complex to serve as offices and lecture theatres. The approval of the medical college comes against an ongoing process by the National Assembly to legislate conversion of MAUTECH from a specialised technical university to a conventional institution to help it diversify to disciplines such as medicine. Referring to this, Gurumpawo said in the statement from the university, “Recall that the bill for the conversion is currently before the House of Representatives for concurrence following its passage into law by the Nigerian Senate on 18th December 2019.”

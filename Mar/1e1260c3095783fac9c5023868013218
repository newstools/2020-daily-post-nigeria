Manchester United head coach, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has said he has no ‘qualms’ about playing goalkeeper, David De Gea ahead of Sergio Romero in Thursday’s FA Cup fifth-round tie against Derby County at the iPro Stadium. Romero has played in twelve of Man United’s sixteen cup fixtures so far this season, but Solskjaer believes De Gea’s performances for the Red Devils has been great. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday, the Norwegian was quoted by the Man Utd’s official website as saying: “Well, it’s not a given that Sergio Romero will play, of course, but Sergio has done well in the games he has played. “But I have no qualms about playing David in every game to be fair, because what he has done and his performances they have been great.” Solskjaer’s men head to the game following a 1-1 draw against Everton in the Premier League last weekend. The match kick-off is at 8: 45pm.

European club, FC Sion, has sacked former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder, Alex Song, for refusing to take a pay cut due to the Coronavirus outbreak in Europe, according to Swiss newspaper, Blick. The Swiss top-flight club also sacked Senegalese midfielder, Birama Ndoye, and Ivory Coast stars, Xavier Kouassi and Seydou Doumbia, for the same reason. The four African players were not comfortable with the measures taken by Sion to check their finances during this challenging period of COVID-19 pandemic. Sion president Christian Constantin notified the first-team players about the new development earlier this week, but Song, Ndoye, Kouassi, and Seydou refused to respond. In reaction, Sion relieved the players of their contracts. Song, Doumbia, and Ndoye were set to become free agents in the summer with their contracts expiring in June, while Kouassi is tied to Sion until 2023. DAILY POST recalls that all the major leagues in Europe, including the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1, have all postponed their domestic matches due to the spread of coronavirus. Coronavirus (COVID-19), broke out in Wuhan Province of China late last year and has gradually spread through several countries of the world, and the World Health Organization (WHO) has since declared the virus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.

Senator representing Ogun West Senatorial District, Tolulope Odebiyi has asked for a change of name of the historical “Egbado to Yewa” In Ogun State, Southwest, Nigeria. The lawmaker’s move is reflected on the bill for an “Act to alter the provisions of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 CAP C23 LFN 2004 to make provision for a change of name of the area referred to as Egbado in Ogun state to “Yewa” as contained in the first schedule of the Constitution. In his lead debate on the bill that has passed second reading at the Senate, Odebiyi noted that, “there was a natural tie to languages and cultures which conjures up images of experience, gender and national origin, but also a dynamic linkage to matters which border on representation. He explained that while the factor of name is, no doubt, rooted in historical traditions, “it remains a rallying point which informed the doggedness with which the “Egbado” people of Ogun West senatorial district have consistently demanded and chosen to be addressed as”Yewa “. He said “It was consistent within this moorings that pundits, political and religious leaders of the geographical area referred to in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended) as ‘Egbado”, have been in the vanguard at ensuring that they are addressed as the ‘Yewa’. Continuing, the lawmaker noted that their consistent yearnings to have the name changed yielded positive results on the 10th, December 1997, when the military administrator of Ogun state, approved the change of the geographical area previously known as “Egbado” to “Yewa”, as gazetted in Ogun state Gazette No.51 Vol. 22 of 18th December 1997. The bill has been referred to the Constitution Review and Amendment Committee.

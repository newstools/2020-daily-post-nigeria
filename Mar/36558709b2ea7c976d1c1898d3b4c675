Former New York City Mayor, Mike Bloomberg, suspended his presidential campaign on Wednesday. Bloomberg’s billions on strategy failed to yield any wins on Super Tuesday, apart from the American Samoa caucuses. The mogul endorsed Democratic front-runner, Joe Biden, former United States Vice President. “I’m a believer in using data to inform decisions. After yesterday’s results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible – and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists”, Bloomberg said in his statement. He stated that he remained clear-eyed about his overriding objective which is victory in November. “I’ve known Joe for a very long time. I know his decency, his honesty, and his commitment to the issues that are so important to our country – including gun safety, health care, climate change, and good jobs”, Bloomberg added. Currently Biden has won more states ahead of major contender, Bernie Sanders. He won Virginia, Alabama, Arkansas, Tennessee, Minnesota, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Texas while Sanders won California, Vermont, Colorado, Utah. The duo continues the battle for more states. At the end, the top aspirant will emerge the Democratic candidate and contest against President Donald Trump in November.

Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher, has identified Manchester United defender, Aaron Wan-Bissaka as the ‘best one-on-one defender in the world currently. Carragher stated this ahead of Man United’s Europa League round of 16 first-leg tie against LASK on Thursday. “I think something Pep has to do next time is not put Raheem Sterling up against Aaron Wan-Bissaka,” Carragher told Monday Night Football. “Normally – I’ve played full-back and didn’t have the pace of Wan-Bissaka – you would try to get out to Sterling because he’s too quick for me, too good on the ball but Wan-Bissaka is almost like ‘yeah, run at me – bring it on’. “Sterling is one of the best three or four wide players in the world, but Wan-Bissaka’s saying: ‘Come on, you’re not going to get past me’. “In that position, I think any other full-back in Europe Raheem is away because of his pace, but even when you actually get past Wan-Bissaka, look at his legs coming from nowhere. “I actually think Wan-Bissaka is the best one-on-one defender as a full-back in the world. “I don’t think anyone would get the better of him.” Wan-Bissaka has been impressive for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men since he joined the Red Devils from Crystal Palace last summer transfer window.

Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has denied rumours making the rounds that President Muhammadu Buhari is having serious cough and has been put on a ventilator. There has been lots of speculation about Buhari’s health, since the news of his Chief of Staff’s coronavirus status went viral on social media. Reports also claimed that one of the two ventilators in Abuja, was commandeered for a top government official. The Information Minister in a statement sent to DAILY POST, labelled both claims as fake news. “The epidemic of fake news is now competing with the pandemic of coronavirus, and this is not helping the fight against the disease. Instances of such fake news include – That there are only two ventilators in Abuja, out of which one has been commandeered for a top government official
– That a British Airways Flight was due to land in Nigeria on Wednesday despite the closure of all international airports.
– That President Muhammadu Buhari has been coughing and is now on ventilator. “Fake. Fake. Fake. It’s all fake news,” Mohammed said. Meanwhile, the Nigerian Centre for Disease Control has confirmed 51 active cases of COVID-19 in the country

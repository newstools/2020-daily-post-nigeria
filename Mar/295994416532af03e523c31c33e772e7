FIFA has recommended that all international football matches scheduled between March and April be postponed, due to the spread of the new coronavirus. In a statement on Friday, the world football governing body also said clubs would be allowed to refuse to send their players to national teams within that time frame. FIFA also confirmed it was working on rescheduling qualifying matches for the 2022 World Cup in both Asia and South America. “All international matches previously scheduled to take place in March and April should now be postponed until such time that they can take place in a safe and secure environment,” the statement read. FIFA added that the “final decision” on any postponements “rests with the respective competition organisers or relevant member association in case of friendlies”.

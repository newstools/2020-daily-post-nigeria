Manchester United’s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, has kicked against the Premier League being voided, as it would deny Liverpool the title. English football is currently on a lockdown, following the coronavirus pandemic. It has led to suggestions that the current campaign could be scrapped, with time running out to complete it. The Athletic reports that Woodward is not in support of the season being voided, stating that it would not be “very fair”. Liverpool have a 25-point gap at the top of the table and look set to end their 30-year wait for a league title. United themselves can still qualify for the Champions League following an impressive unbeaten run.

The Federal Government has disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari will address Nigerians on the Coronavirus scourge at the “appropriate” time. Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed said the information Nigerians needed to hear from the President was already being dished out to them. Addressing journalists in Abuja, the Minister said even though he is not out to pre-empt the president but Buhari may say nothing new. According to Mohammed: “When it is appropriate, Mr President will address the nation. But, I think what you want to hear from Mr President are the kind of things we are telling you. “This is not to preempt or second guess Mr President, I think he will do the needful,” Mr Mohammed said at the end of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) on Wednesday. The Nigerian government had confirmed several cases of COVID-19 in the country. Against the backdrop of the disease outbreak in the country, the Nigerian government had placed a travel ban on some countries. However, an activist who spoke to DAILY POST on anonymity berated Buhari over his silence on the outbreak of COVID-19. “It i’s uncalled-for that Buhari has not addressed Nigerians properly on these issues. The president of a country like the US has addressed his citizens. “Anyways, what do you expect from a man like Buhari, not serious. Give him an opportunity, he may just mess up,” he said.

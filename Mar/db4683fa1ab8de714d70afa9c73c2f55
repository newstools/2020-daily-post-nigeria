A Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court, has granted an interim order declaring Victor Giadom, acting National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), to act as the party’s National Chairman. The Judge, Justice Samira Bature gave the order on Monday after listening to an ex-parte motion filed by Mustapha Salihu, the party’s national vice chairman, north-east. In the motion, Salihu had prayed the court to allow Giadom operate as APC’s acting National Chairman pending the decision of the party’s National Executive Council, NEC. Salihu also prayed the court for an order restraining the APC and its officers or anyone from preventing Giadom from functioning as the acting chairman. He noted that Gaidom should be allowed as acting Chairman pending the hearing of the motion on notice. Justice Bature granted all the prayers sought by Salihu before adjourning the matter to March 20.

The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has reacted to report of rescheduling its 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) over Coronavirus outbreak. Nigeria on Thursday recorded new cases in Lagos State bringing the total number of coronavirus patients in Nigeria to twelve (12). This has led to shutdown of schools in Lagos, Ogun and other states. Also, religious gatherings have been banned in Lagos state. JAMB in a statement on its official Twitter page denied reports that it has rescheduled its exam. The board disclosed that all examinations will end on March 21st, 2020. The post read: “This is to bring to the notice of the public that the Board has not rescheduled its examinations as being rumoured around. “All examinations would end on Saturday, 21 March 2020 with the few candidates in Bayelsa and Rivers States only who were earlier scheduled to sit the examinations next week.” The Board further advised candidates in Rivers and Bayelsa states to reprint their slips to note the venue and time of their adjusted examination schedules.

Governor of Ekiti state Dr Kayode Fayemi has begun moves to dethrone some prominent traditional rulers in the state. The affected Obas are the 16 Prominent traditional rulers known as Pelupelu who kicked against the appointment of Alawe of Ilawe Ekiti Oba Ajibade Alabi as the chairman of the Council of Obas in the state. The Obas described the appointment of Alawe of Ilawe, outside the 16 Obas called Alademerindinlogin to occupy the exalted seat of the Chairman of the traditional council, as a clear violation of the Ekiti State Chieftaincy Law. However, since the crisis, the Obas have shunned meetings of the council of Obas and government functions as part of measures to show their grievances. Taking a cue from his Kano State counterpart Abdullahi Ganduje who successfully dethrone the Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi, few days ago, governor Fayemi has issued a query to all the sixteen prominent Obas known as Pelupelu over their absence from meetings of the traditional Council of Obas and government functions. The query was issued by the Bureau of Chieftaincy Affairs on the order of the governor. The query according to reports is part of measures to follow necessary constitutional procedures for the removal of the monarchs. When contacted, the Chief Press Secretary to the governor Mr Yinka Oyebode said the governor has no intention to remove any Oba. He said the letter issued to the monarch was an administrative thing by the bureau just to inquire about the wellbeing of the monarch after they have been absent from meetings for a while without permission.

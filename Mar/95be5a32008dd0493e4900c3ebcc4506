Speaking through his member, Dauda Nalado BUK Kano, Sheik Sunusi said had it been government was proactive enough, the disease wouldn’t have spread so quickly from onset. However, the Shiites urged Nigerians to endeavor to domesticate all guiding instructions that will stall the further spread of the pandemic that include the washing of hands with soap, using protective wears. In the same vein, the movement called for the immediate release of their leader, Shiek Ibrahim Elzazzaki with other prisoners if the allegations making the rounds that an affected person was planted in the correctional center to infect the Sheik. “We call for the immediate release unconditionally from the correctional center, which is overcrowded with prisoners and the one allegedly planted to infect our leader”. He said, “we are aware of the situations at the correctional center in Kaduna and we call on the authorities to immediately and unconditionally release our Sheik.” Sheik Dr Sunusi said the movement has since embarked on public awareness on need to comply with experts advice on how to protect themselves.

Pastor Tunde Bakare, of the Dominion Hall, Citadel Global Community Church, formerly Latter Rain Assembly, has asked the Presidency to address the rumours surrounding Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo and the cabal. Bakare stated this while delivering a sermon on Sunday. Osinbajo has reportedly been in a strain relationship with the cabal at the Presidency, a situation that led to the sacking and redeployment of some of his personal assistants. The Vice was also stopped from overseeing the Social Investment Programme, SIP, and the Economic Advisory Team of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s government. The General Overseer, however, noted that there was a need for the Presidency to address the matter. According to Bakare, “It is my considered opinion that all the rumour mills and things going around the Vice-President in this nation, the government must address this country and tell the plain truth about what is going on instead of letting people to continue to make guesses that are unprofitable for our nation or anybody. “And if they don’t want to say anything, then let them not say but stop this nonsense that is going on. You have a moral responsibility to account for the mess that is going on if you don’t stop it. “I am not sure Osinbajo was a party man. I am not sure he was there when the APC was being formed. “I moved the motion for the merger of the CPC and the ACN at the Eagle Square. He was not anywhere around there that day. “In fact, I can tell you that he went to the Supreme Court to argue a case on that day when they were looking for him… one day I will tell you the story of what transpired that night. “Until the kings of the mountain give you access, you cannot do anything on that mountain. But when they give you access, you must know how to carry yourself upon the mountain.”

Some candidates who have written the 2020 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), have been unable to check their results today (Tuesday). A quick check by DAILY POST shows that the link to the result checker is temporarily not available on JAMBâ€™s website. The board on Monday, released results of 312,000 candidates who sat for the exam on Saturday. However, candidates who were not able to check yesterday and those who wrote yesterday, have been unable to access their results. Others have tried to check with their mobile phones, but have encountered similar difficulties.

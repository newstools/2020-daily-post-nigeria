The Kaduna State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has expressed concern with the recent revelation of Governor Nasir El-Rufai, being positive for Coronavirus, praying for his quick recovery from the virus. It urged the government to intermittently relax the curfew in the State. The party in a statement signed by its Publicity Secretary, Abraham Alberah Catoh, urged the state COVID-19 committee led by the deputy governor, Dr Hadiza Balarebe to redouble their efforts in the areas of continuous education and public enlightenment on how to go about being tested as quickly as possible. It noted that, “realizing that hunger is another dangerous disease, the party makes a passionate but strong appeal to the government to effect an intermittent but controlled relaxation of the curfew currently in force to allow people to either stock or re-stock household needs like food stuffs, sanitaries, drugs etc. “We believe this will add value to the commitment of the public to respect and obey government directives. It will also allow public spirited individuals the opportunity to come to the aid of the needy members of our society. “This should be in addition to the phone lines dedicated by government. The public out cry that the lines are not responding to callers should be looked into without further delay. “This is time for Public Confidence building and relevant government officials need to respond to complaints and advises swiftly. We are in an important project of Government/Public Partnership Programme which succeed for our over all interest and safety.” The party called on all members of the public to support the government, especially now and respect its directives. The party added, “May God Almighty take the lead as we journey out of the woods. Amen.”

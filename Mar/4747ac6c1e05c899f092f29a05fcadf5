Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, and captain, Harry Kane, immediately stood up and went down the tunnel without saying a word after midfielder, Gedson Fernandes missed the decisive spot-kick in Spurs’ defeat against Norwich City in the FA Cup fifth-round on Wednesday night. According to Football London, Mourinho and Kane’s reactions were captured on video by a supporter behind the dugout. Mourinho and Kane walked disconsolately away from the pitch as Tottenham was defeated 3-2 on penalties by the Canaries in front of their home fans after the game had finished 1-1 after 120 minutes. Norwich goalkeeper, Tim Krul, was the hero for Norwich, saving penalties from Troy Parrott and Gedson Fernandes. Tottenham’s next fixture is against Burnley in the Premier League on Saturday. Mourinho’s side is currently in the seventh position on the Premier League table with 40 points from 28 games.

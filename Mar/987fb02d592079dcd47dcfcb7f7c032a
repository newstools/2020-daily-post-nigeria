Chelsea midfielder, Mason Mount has apologised to manager, Frank Lampard after breaking the clubâ€™s self-isolation orders last weekend. DAILY POST recalls that Mount left self-isolation to join West Ham star, Declan Rice for a kickabout on Sunday amid coronavirus pandemic. Chelsea had told Mount and the rest of the Blues players to self-isolate under government guidelines after winger, Callum Hudson-Odoi, tested positive for Coronavirus last Thursday. But instead, the 21-year-old joined close friend Rice for a public kickabout at the Trent Park Football center, near Barnet. According to MailOnline, Mount has personally apologised to Lampard during a phone call conversation. The newspaper reports that Chelsea has also reminded Mount and the rest of the squad of their responsibilities.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) on Thursday expressed worry that some countries have not taken coronavirus seriously. The body said their level of political commitment and actions were poor. Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, at the daily media briefing on COVID-19 stressed that the epidemic was a global threat, adding that the solution was aggressive preparedness. “Activate your emergency plans through that whole-government approach”, Ghebreyesus told countries. “Educate your public, so that people know what the symptoms are and know how to protect themselves and others. “Increase your testing capacity; get your hospitals ready; ensure essential supplies are available. “Train your health workers to identify cases, provide careful and compassionate treatment, and protect themselves from infection.” He stated that if countries act aggressively to find, isolate and treat cases, to trace every contact, the fight would be won. Ghebreyesus noted that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMG) have made funds available to stabilise health systems and reduce the economic consequences of the coronavirus. The fund will support access to critical supplies and equipment, and will be available to countries who need it, in line with WHO’s Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan. As at Wednesday, the Nigeria government was yet to release the N620million earmarked for the coronavirus.

Manchester United will offer £50million for Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the UK Sun reports. It is believed the Gunners could cash in on their captain, with his contract set to expire next summer. There is a feeling around the Emirates, that the 30-year-old will not sign an extension and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is ready to take advantage. Aubameyang has been linked with a move away from Arsenal with the club crashing out of the Europa League and currently ninth in the Premier League table. Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are also keen on the Gabon striker, who arrived in England for a club record fee of £56million in January 2018. United brought in Odion Ighalo on loan in January, but it is unclear how long he will stay at the club.

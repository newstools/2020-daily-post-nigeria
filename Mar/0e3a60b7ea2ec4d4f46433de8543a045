American singer, Keri Hilson has revealed why Africa has not recorded an increased rate of Coronavirus since its outbreak in Wuhan, China. Keri Hilson disclosed that the reason COVID-19 is not prevalent in Africa is because the region is not a 5G networks region. According to her, experiments have shown the possibility that the dangerous levels of electromagnetic radiation (5G) could be causing the contagious virus. The 37-year old on her Twitter page wrote: “People have been trying to warn us about 5G for YEARS. Petitions, organizations, studies…what we’re going through is the effects of radiation. 5G launched in CHINA. Nov 1, 2019. People dropped dead. “Turn off 5G by disabling LTE!!! “Why do you think the virus is not happening in Africa like that? Not a 5G region. There may be a few bases there, but not as prevalent as other countries. It has nothing to do with melanin. “And to be clear, I’m saying there have been lots of studies and experiments that point to the possibility that the dangerous levels of electromagnetic radiation (5G) could be causing the contagious virus.”

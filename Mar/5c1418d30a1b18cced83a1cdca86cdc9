Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Jigawa State Salisu Mamuda Kuit has escaped lynch by irate party supporters. The incident happened on Monday at the party’s headquarters in Dutse during ward Congress. Party supporters thronged party headquarters to channel their grievances to the Peoples Democratic Party PDP ward Congress committee headed by Senator Isah Hamma Misau. DAILY POST reported that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP ward Congress committee in Jigawa State cancelled all elections conducted before the committee’s approved time. The committee was saddled with the responsibilities of monitoring the processes of the election. Senator Misau said the committee will not tolerate any election conducted before the scheduled time and has not been monitored by its representatives. Trouble started when the party chairman tried to address the gathering on the processes of the Congress, and youths began to shout, accusing state party leadership of selling the party in the previous elections. The youth chanted “Bamayi”, “kun sayar mana da Jam’iyyar”, “sai nun canzaku”, meaning we don’t like your leadership, you have sold our great party, we must change you”. They also accused the party leadership of working against the interest of the party by trying to enforce party leadership at ward, local government and state levels. Responding to the incident the state party chairman said the youth were mobilized to attack his personality. He said the party had successfully conducted its Congress across all 287 words in the state. Kuit said the result would soon be forwarded to the National secretariat of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.

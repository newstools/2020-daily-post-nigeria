Chelsea defender, Reece James, has said that he wants Real Madrid star, Eden Hazard, back at Stamford Bridge because he loves the Belgian’s style of play. According to James, Hazard will go down to become one of Chelsea’s best players ever. Hazard left Chelsea at the end of the 2018/2019 season after spending seven years at the Blues. The 29-year-old won six major honours during his time at the West London club. His departure from Chelsea to Real Madrid prompted Frank Lampard’s side to change course and build their team around up-and-coming young talent. But James admitted that he still loves Hazard and would like to see the forward return to Chelsea in the future. “I would love to see Eden Hazard come back to Chelsea,” the 20-year-old told Bleacher Report. “I just loved the way he played. I still love him. “Hazard will go down as one of Chelsea’s best players ever.” Hazard scored 110 goals and registered 92 assists in 352 appearances during his time at Chelsea.

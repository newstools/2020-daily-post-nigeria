The National Association of Ogun State Students (NAOSS) has called on the Federal Government and the government of Ogun State to, as a matter of urgency, deploy health officers with testing kits to the ports of entry into Nigeria from Benin Republic. The health officers, they said, would help to test people entering into Nigeria from the neighbouring country so as to prevent the spread of Coronavirus pandemic. NAOSS, in a statement by its National President, Gbemileke Ogunronbi, on Friday, said the call was necessitated by the report of the first case of Coronavirus outbreak in Benin Republic. DAILY POST reports that Ogun has multiple entries that link Nigeria to Benin Republic. The students body insisted that there was a need for the State government to be on the alert as a result of its closeness to Benin. NAOSS, in order to prevent a major health crisis in the State, urged the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Tomi Coker, to urgently place hospitals and health centres in border areas on the alert, asking officials to be on the look out for patients with symptoms of Covid-19. Likewise, the Ogun students called on the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to man the land borders in the state without taking chances, while praying traditional rulers and leaders of these communities to assist government by reporting anyone with suspected Coronavirus symptoms.

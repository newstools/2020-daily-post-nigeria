A Consultant Virologist, Dr Adeola Fowotade, says hot tropical climate as obtainable in Nigeria could help suppress the spread of coronavirus COVID-19. Fowotade told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ibadan that some experts think the COVID-19 may behave like the influenza virus, which is a seasonal disease common in colder climates, making Nigeria too hot for coronavirus to spread. “That is an extrapolation from what happened with influenza virus also known as the flu, which is most prevalent in colder climate during winter. “We believe that if COVID-19 is a Respiratory Tract Infection, probably it will follow the same pattern. “There is a very high chance there will be some remission as the temperature gets warmer in those temperate places. “But for us with tropical climate, we believe that this outbreak might not go on for too long and might abate very soon. “This is because the droplets generated by the virus cannot travel far and this virus is an envelope virus. “Envelop viruses are very susceptible and cannot survive very long in hot climate,” she said. Fowotade, however, urged Nigerians especially healthcare workers to be vigilant and comply with standard hygiene rules. “We should still continue to take precautions because we found that this virus has a very high transmissibility, that is, when one person is infected that person has a high chance of infecting four more people. “It is very important that we ensure that we prevent infections by observing best precautionary and preventive measures,” she said.

Residents of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT, Abuja on Tuesday complied with the lock down order by President Muhammadu Buhari. Recall that Buhari had on Sunday ordered a total lock down of Abuja, Lagos and Ogun States in a bid to tackle the spread of Coronavirus. But the President later exempted those offering essential services in the affected states. Following the order, DAILY POST while monitoring the situation in some satellite towns, observed that there was total compliance in parts of Abuja. Areas toured by DAILY POST include Kubwa Express way, Dutsen Alhaji market, Dutsen-Bwari road, Gwarinpa, Kubwa town. In all these areas visited, there was total compliance to the stay at home order as road side shops were all closed and petty traders who usually displayed their goods by the roadside were nowhere to be seen. Some commercial banks and shopping plazas along these routes were noticeably closed. Despite the total lock down, a couple of vehicles and motorcycles could be seen along some of the routes visited. However, security operatives were noticed at every turn, apparently ensuring that residents strictly adhered to the presidentâ€™s directives.

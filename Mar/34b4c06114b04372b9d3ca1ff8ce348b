The Aso Villa Chapel on Sunday, complied to the ban on gathering of not more than 20 people over the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The service, which was livestreamed to members across the world was not physically attended by the Chaplain and the technical staff. Confirming the development, Laolu Akande, Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Office of the Vice President, explained that less than ten persons were physically available. “Aso Villa Chapel just concluded an online service now, where worshippers were able to stay in their homes and be part of a Sunday service,” he said in a tweet. “We were blessed with the livestreaming, kudos to the Villa Chaplain and the less than 10 people (number of staff on ground) that made it happen”. Meanwhile, some churches in parts of the country disobeyed the ban placed on public gathering. Living Faith Church, Ota Ogun State, Dunamis Abuja and Christ Embassy Church in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, were among churches that disobeyed the order.

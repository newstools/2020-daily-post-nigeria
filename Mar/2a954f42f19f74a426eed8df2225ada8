Odion Ighalo scored a brace, as Manchester United outclassed Derby County 3-0, to qualify for the quarter-final of the FA Cup on Thursday night. The Nigerian striker was only making his second start for the Red Devils, since he completed a six-month loan move from Shanghai Shenhua on transfer deadline day. Ighalo doubled United’s lead, after Luke Shaw had volleyed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men in front. The 30-year-old added one more in the second half, after running onto Juan Mata’s pass. The win extends United’s unbeaten run to nine games. They will now face bottom club Norwich City for a place in the semis.

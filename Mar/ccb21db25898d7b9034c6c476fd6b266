Derby County captain, Wayne Rooney, feels Liverpool deserve to win this season’s Premier League title. Rooney also insists that the campaign must be complete to decide teams that will gain promotion, suffer relegation and qualify for Europe matches. The Premier League season has been postponed until at least May 2, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Liverpool only need two more wins to be confirmed champions and Rooney says they deserve it. The former Manchester United striker also warned that the season must be completed, otherwise there will be legal issues. “Liverpool will win the Premier League. [They] have been fantastic. They have put so much work in. They deserve this title. Can you imagine waiting 30 years and then having it taken away like this? The right decision has been made. “It’s also right in terms of promotion and relegation and Champions League places. These issues are so big for the clubs involved that I imagine there would be a lot of legal fights if the season was just abandoned. The fair thing is to finish 2019-20 — even if we have to lose next season in the process,” Rooney wrote in his weekly column in The Times. Jurgen Klopp’s men have not lifted a league title in 30 years.

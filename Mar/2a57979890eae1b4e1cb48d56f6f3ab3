Former Arsenal star, Paul Merson, is against the idea of the Premier League handing the title to Liverpool before the end of this season. English football is currently on an enforced break until April 4 at least, due to the coronavirus pandemic. After 29 fixtures in the top flight, Liverpool are 25 points ahead of Manchester City at the top of the table. Jurgen Klopp’s men need only two more wins to be confirmed champions. With a lot of uncertainty surrounding the resumption of the Premier League, there have been calls for the Reds to be awarded the trophy. But Merson, using snooker analogy, explained why that will not work. He told Sky Sports: “It’s all well saying Liverpool are 25 points clear, but if I played snooker with my mate tomorrow, and I needed 25 snookers to win, and he said: ‘The game has finished, there’s no point playing on!’ – for the next week or two, I’d be saying: ‘But I could have won that!”

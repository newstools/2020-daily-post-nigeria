The Methodist Church of Nigeria, has urged its members to defy ban on public gatherings as its services will not be cancelled. Recall that some state governments in Nigeria had placed a ban on public gatherings over the scourge of Coronavirus in the country. However, Prelate of Methodist Church, Samuel Kanu Uche, insisted that the church won’t cancel its services because preventive measures are being put in place to safeguard members. In a letter to Archbishops, bishops and Lay Presidents of the Uche directed that all local branches must be fumigated with immediate effect. According to the letter obtained by DAILY POST, hand sanitizers should be provided at the entrance of all branches of Methodist Churches across the country. The letter reads: “This is to convey our empathy to our people on the ravaging COVID-19 which is claiming lives throughout the world. “The pandemic is not only a threat to the existence of Humanity but a brutal challenge to our corporate existence. “As the leader of the people called Methodists in Nigeria, I therefore direct as follows: Services in all churches will continue unrestricted as sanitizers shall be provided at the entrance of the church. “All our local churches shall be fumigated with immediate effect and preferably on a regular basis. “That the use of the Chalice is suspended for the next 4 weeks. Single cups should be used for the administration of the Sacrament of Holy Communion and sterilized after use. “All conveniences especially toilets should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected at least two times on a daily basis “The shaking of hands during our services shall be discontinued until further notice.”

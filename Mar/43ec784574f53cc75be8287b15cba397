The Department of State Services (DSS) on Monday said it does not conduct its recruitment through website, twitter, Facebook or any other social media platforms. Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the service Dr Peter Afunanya, said this while dissociating the service from some websites, being operated fraudulently by impostors. According to him, the service do not presently own or operate an official website or any social media platforms, particularly, twitter and Facebook handles. Afunaya also urged the public to desist from spreading false information on prevailing matters of national concern that might cause anxiety, confusion and fear. “Therefore, such websites, Facebook pages and twitter handles disguised as those of the DSS for purposes of employment or any other reason should be disregarded. “Persons of dubious character, who are guided by pecuniary interests, use false social media platforms suggesting to be owned by the DSS to lure and defraud unsuspecting members of the public. “The Service wishes to inform the public that it only operates one official email (dsspr@dss.gov.ng) and will not hesitate to make its social media details public if it opens any,” he said. He, however, warned that defaulters would be dealt with in accordance with the law.

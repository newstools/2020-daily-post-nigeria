Barcelona left-back, Jordi Alba, has lashed out at his own supporters for whistling the team, during their 1-0 victory over Real Sociedad on Saturday. Lionel Messi netted the winner from the penalty spot in the 81st minute. Alba had a goal ruled out for offside in stoppage time and had celebrated by cupping his ears to the fans. He explained after the game, that he was not happy with the whistles aimed at his team-mates during the first half. “No one likes to play poorly or how we’re playing at the moment, but I don’t like it when in the 15th minute with the score goalless there are whistles,” he told reporters. “No one likes it when the fans go against you, especially in your own stadium. Our attitude is good and all the players are giving everything out on the pitch. I’m not going to hide. Just as I respect everyone, they also have to respect me.” The win took Barca two points clear of Real Madrid, who play Real Betis on Sunday.

The Multi-National Joint Task Force (MNJTF) has eliminated Mallam Bakura, a notorious terrorist leader. Bakura had been an ISWAP commander but later teamed up with elusive Boko Haram leader, Abubakar Shekau. This was contained in a statement on Friday by Colonel Timothy Antigha, Chief of Military Public Information, MNJTF. It said the Force carried out a devastating joint air/artillery interdiction at the camp of Bakura on Thursday. “Battle Damage Assessment of the joint and combined interdiction indicates that Mallam Bakura and his aides have been killed”, the statement noted. “After Impact, his makeshift abode and headquarters concealed within vegetation and abandoned buildings were completely obliterated. “Bakura was a key figure in ISWAP, but became a factional leader in 2018, following disagreements with Abu-Mossad Albarnawee. “Later he teamed up with Shekau’s Boko Haram. Bakura was active in the southern parts of Niger Republic and some islands in Lake Chad.” The military said Bakura was involved in gruesome attacks against civilian and military targets in the locality as well as smuggling and hostage taking. DAILY POST reports that his elimination followed that of top ISWAP and Boko Haram commanders. The MNJTF assured of more deadly strikes against terrorists and their hideouts.

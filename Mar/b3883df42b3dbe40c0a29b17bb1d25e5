Former Liverpool and Juventus star, Mohamed Sissoko, has urged Manchester United midfielder, Paul Pogba, to join a club that makes him feel important. DAILY POST recalls that Pogba, who is widely expected to leave Man United at the end of this season, has drawn interest from Real Madrid and Juventus in the past. The 27-year-old’s current deal at Man United will expire at the end of next season. The France World Cup winner is currently recovering from ankle surgery and has been out of action for several weeks. “I know that Zidane wants Pogba at Real Madrid, but he would like to return to Juventus,” Sissoko told Europa Calcio. “But these are situations that depend not only on Pogba but also on Manchester United. “He has a contract until 2021 with the English club. “In my opinion, Pogba must find a team that makes him feels important to regain his first level.”

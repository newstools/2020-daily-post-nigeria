Anthony Joshua’s next fight will be against Kubrat Pulev at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Saturday, June 20. The 38-year-old Pulev is the mandatory IBF challenger to take on Joshua, who currently holds the WBA, IBF and WBO titles. Joshua won back the belts with a unanimous point victory over Andy Ruiz Jr. in December. “I am happy to have the opportunity to show the world how strong I really am,” Pulev told reporters on Monday. It will be Joshua’s first fight in the UK, since he defeated Alexander Povetkin at Wembley in September, 2018. This also means boxing fans won’t get to see Joshua fight Tyson Fury just yet. Both British boxers now hold all of the division’s belts between them. However, Deontay Wilder has triggered a rematch clause with Fury.

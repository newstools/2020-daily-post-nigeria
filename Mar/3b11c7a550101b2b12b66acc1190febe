Governor Dapo Abiodun, on behalf of the people of Ogun State, has appreciated what he called “the voluntary humanitarian contributions” of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, and Pastor Enoch Adeboye. DAILY POST reports that Obasanjo donated his 32-room former residence to the state government to serve as an isolation centre, while Pastor Adeboye was said to have also donated medical equipment, ICU beds and ventilators for the use of Coronavirus patients. In a statement he signed on Saturday, Gov Abiodun also thanked Mr Fola Adeola and Alhaji Abdulsamad Rabiu, for their responses to the plea for intervention from private organisations and religious bodies to help in waging the war against the viral disease. Like Obasanjo, Abiodun said Mr Fola Adeola, who is the founder of Fate Foundation, also donated his property in Abeokuta as an isolation centre, adding that Alhaji Rabiu, who is the Chairman of BUA, donated 100 million Naira and pledged medical equipment and supplies to the State COVID-19 Pandemic Support Fund. The Governor assured the people of the state that Government would make judicious use of the donations, saying: “I want to personally assure the entire citizenry of Ogun State that I will ensure the judicious use of these donations of funds and property towards the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic. “We are hopeful that, as these appreciated donations contribute significantly to the fight against COVID-19, other well-meaning Nigerians would follow their lead and noble example. “This pandemic poses a collective challenge and together, we must join hands in fighting it. We will confront it. We will slow it down. We will defeat it.”

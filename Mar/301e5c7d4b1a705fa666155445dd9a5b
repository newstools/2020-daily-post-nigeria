American actor, Orlando Bloom, has warned his fans around against the dangers of porn. The 43-year-old actor who said porn is destructive, revealed that he once went celibate for 6 months before his relationship with Katy Perry because porn is destructive for relationship and does not help one gain confidence in your sex life. “If you want to be serious about a relationship, go celibate for a few months and figure it out. “It was insane. I don’t think it is healthy. I don’t think it was advisable. You have to keep it moving down there,” Bloom said. “Porn is super-disruptive to your sex life, to your libido.” Speaking to People, he added that he didn’t look to pornography as a substitute for sex after a recommendation from his friend. “They’ve done the studies, they can’t find any kids who don’t watch porn. When you watch multiple people at multiple times in one evening, how is your actual real-life partner going to match up? It’s just so destructive,” he added.

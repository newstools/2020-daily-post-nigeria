The Imo State House of Assembly led by Chiji Collins, has asked that the southeast states be included in the sharing of 22.7 billion dollars recently released to the federal government as foreign loan. The House at the plenary on Tuesday, moved a motion, asking why the southeast states were excluded in the loan. The motion, according to our correspondent in the state, was moved by the member representing Ideato-north state constituency, Arthur Egwim. Egwim, by the motion, has urged the Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma to take up with the presidency on the issue of the exclusion of Imo and other southeast states in the distribution of 22.7 billion dollars foreign loan approved by the senate for infrastructural development. Here him, “Whereas the senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria has approved the sum of $22.7bn as foreign loan to be distributed and applied for various developmental projects in the six geopolitical zones of the country. “Observing with utter disappointment that most of the southeast states were not allocated any amount from the loan. “Observing also that the exclusion smacks of purposeful case of marginalization of the Igbo speaking States. “Be it resolved by this honourable House to urge the Governor of Imo state and other Southeast governors to wade into the matter with a view to finding out why the states were not included.” The motion further urged other southeast leaders to work in synergy with the governors in ensuring that the geopolitical zone is not marginalized in the scheme of things in future occurrences. The motion received massive support from members and was subsequently adopted by the House.

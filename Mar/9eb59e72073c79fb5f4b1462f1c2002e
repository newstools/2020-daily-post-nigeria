The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Taiwo Adisa, has debunked the news going round that his principal contracted Coronavirus (COVID-19) at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) unification rally held on March 18 in Ibadan. According to Adisa, the insinuations in some quarters that Makinde, who on Monday tested positive to Coronavirus, contracted the deadly disease at the PDP rally was not correct. He said this in a statement issued to newsmen on Tuesday in Ibadan that there was no known incident of Coronavirus as of the time the rally was held, NAN reports. Adisa said: “The issue of the governor being said to have contracted COVID-19 at the March 18 PDP South-West Zonal Unification Rally doesn’t come to play because there was no known incident of the virus in Oyo State at that time. “Also, the governor didn’t have any symptom(s) as of that time. “At the time that the rally was held, there was no known case of the COVID-19 and after the rally. “Gov. Makinde did put out a message to indicate that if he had got a hint of the existence of Coronavirus in the state an hour to the rally, he would have canceled the event. “He took responsibility for holding the rally. So, we can’t afford to politicise the issue of COVID-19. It is beyond politics.” Meanwhile, Makinde has since apologised for the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) rally held in Ibadan amid Coronavirus scare.

The All Progressives Congress (APC), State Chairmen Forum has denied passing a vote of confidence on Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the party. The forum described as fraudulent the confidence vote on Oshiomhole linked to it, NAN reports. A statement by its Publicity Secretary, Alhaji Lawal Liman, said that there was no such decision reached by the forum. Liman, who is also the party’s Chairman in Zamfara State, insisted that the forum had not met to deliberate on the crisis that had engulfed the party. “We have not met, but we plan to meet before APC’s National Executive Council (NEC), meeting scheduled for March 17, 2020. “As soon as some state chairmen saw the statement, they started calling me to find out the veracity of the statement. “l want to confirm to my colleagues that there was no meeting held and there was no statement issued to pass a vote of confidence on the APC National Chairman. “All issues will be resolved at the next NEC meeting and, hopefully, we will hold a meeting of the forum before the said NEC meeting. “We will not, in any way, bring the name of the forum to disrepute by doing what will take away our credibility,” he said. This is coming at a time when a Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court had suspended Oshiomhole as National Chairman of APC. However, a Kano Federal High Court had vacated the ruling, while ordering the APC National Chairman to resume his duties.

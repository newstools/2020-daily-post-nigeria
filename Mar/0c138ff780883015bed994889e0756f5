The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, has said it does not provide personal information on cases of Coronavirus. NCDC was reacting to an enquiry by DAILY POST regarding the status of Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari, who has allegedly tested positive for the virus. Report had emerged on Tuesday that the Chief of Staff tested positive for COVID-19 while President Muhammadu Buhari tested negative to the virus. According to a report by THISDAY, the President was tested for the disease on Monday by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) but his result came out negative. Sources at the presidency told the newspaper that the test for the president became necessary after his Chief of Staff, Mr. Abba Kyari tested positive for COVID-19 the same Monday. Recall that Kyari had visisted Germany on Saturday, March 7th to meet with officials of Siemens in Munich on the Nigerian electricity expansion programme. But reacting, NCDC media team said, ”Please, NCDC has not provided personal information of any case, and will not provide information on a case by case basis. Dr. Ihekweazu stated this yesterday, and we are re-iterating.”

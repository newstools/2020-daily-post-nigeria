Awareness for Good Leadership, Peace and Development (APGDA), has called on the Katsina Government and the Northwest region to establish an outfit similar to Amotekun to tackle insecurity. Amotekun, the security outfit formed by Southwest governors, was initiated to support government security agencies in protecting the region. APGDA President, Abdullahi Aliyu, gave the advice in a chat with journalists after he submitted a petition at the Katsina State Governor’s Lodge in Abuja. Katsina is the home state of President Muhammadu Buhari. He urged Governor Aminu Masari to re-think his recent decisions and policies, including the suspension of activities of vigilante groups. Aliyu warned that the decision would further expose the people to bandits’ attacks, NAN reports. “Recent attacks on various communities in Katsina State exposed how vulnerable these people are as a result of banning activities of vigilante group nine months ago without introducing another measure”, he said. “States such as Kaduna, Kano, Nasarawa, Niger, Adamawa, Plateau, Borno, South West, and South-Eastern states’ vigilantes and hunters are encouraged to support security personnel in tackling insecurity and insurgency. “Nine months ago, retired generals, other senior military officers, elder statesmen, senior police officers and various stakeholders from Katsina State held a conference with a view to support the state government. “Up till today, the state government has not received a report that has a combined input from senior citizens from the state.” The group lamented that the dissolution of elected chairmen of 34 local governments in Katsina had affected the economy and security of over two million people. APGDA further advised Masari to urgently meet the yearnings and aspirations of the people across the state.

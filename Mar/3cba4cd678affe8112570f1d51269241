At least fifteen commercial transporters were arrested and 80 motorcycles seized on Monday for violating the restriction order on movement of people by the Kwara State government. Deputy governor of the state, Mr Kayode Alabi, disclosed this while receiving N28.5m donated by the United Bank for Africa, UBA, to support the efforts of the state government in the crusade against COVID-19 pandemic in the state. He said the arrests and seizures were effected for violating the government’s order and protocols. The deputy governor said that nobody or the seized property would be released until further directives were given on them. Commending the task force for their selfless services, Alabi disclosed that a church in Idofian, suburb of Ilorin, the state capital, was also shut down on Sunday while preparing for service. The deputy governor further hinted that the task force was considering shutting down markets but only after the state government must have redeemed its pledge to distribute food items as palliative measure with the Emir of Shonga, Dr Haliru Yahaya appointed as chairman of the committe to handle the assignment. Earlier, presenting the cheque to the deputy governor who is also the chairman of the Task force team for the fight against the pandemic in the state, Mr Kazeem Salaudeen, head of the bank in Kwara state, said the money was the bank’s support for the government in the efforts to curtail the spread of the disease. Alabi thanked the bank and promised that the money would be domiciled in UBA for accountability in managing the pandemic.

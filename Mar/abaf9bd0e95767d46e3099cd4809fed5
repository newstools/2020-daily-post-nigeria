 As parts of its contribution to the fight against further spread of the dreaded coronavirus, T Pumpy Concept Limited, owners of T Pumpy Estate, has donated preventive kits to residents of her estate and its environs.  The MD/CEO, Tayo Adaralegbe, who made thus disclosure on Friday, said his target would be people in suburbs who can not really afford them.  He said the company would continue to sensitize its residents and the general public on the need to keep social distancing and stay safe and the global pandemic spreads its wings in Nigeria.  At the moment, 88 cases have been confirmed in Nigeria with only one death so fat recorded. However, Mr. Adaralegbe said T Pumpy would play its part to make sure the disease does not spread further.  He, therefore, urged residents of the estates and the entire nation to stay indoors as the relevant authorities find a lasting panacea to the menace.  He added ” this war against this virus is a collective war. Not a war for government alone to fight. This is a war for all humanity to fight… I am only contributing my own force to win this war for humanity.”

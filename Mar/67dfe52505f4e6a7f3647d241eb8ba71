Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, was full of praise for Billy Gilmour, following their 2-0 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth round on Tuesday night. Willian opened scoring in the first half, after Adrian fumbled his shot into the net. Ross Barkley doubled the Blues’ lead after the break, with a solo run and finish. However, it was Gilmour who caught Lampard’s eye, with the 18-year-old midfielder only making his third start for the club. “What an incredible performance for a young player,” Lampard told the BBC. “He was a calm head in that first five or 10 minutes. He’s a throwback of a midfielder. “Can you put your foot in? Yes. Can you make angles to play the passes? Yes. He’s only slight in stature but he’s huge in personality. He deserves people to talk about him after a performance like that.”

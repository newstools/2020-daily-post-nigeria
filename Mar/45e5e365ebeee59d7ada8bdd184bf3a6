The Federal Government has urged Nigerians to embrace unity and de-emphasis ethnicity, religion, social status. Lai Mohammed, Minister of Information and Culture said the activities of Boko Haram insurgents would reduce when Nigerians embrace unity. He noted that through unity, Boko Haram and “unscrupulous politicians” won’t be able to use religion to divide the country. Mohammed spoke at the 70th Anniversary of Government College in Keffi, Nasarawa State, on Saturday and was contained in a statement signed and sent to DAILY POST by his Media Aide, Segun Adeyemi. He stated that if Nigerians would allow themselves to be guided by the Keffi Model, the “present atmosphere of disunity at all levels – religious, ethnic, regional, etc – will disappear and peace will return to the nation.” While urging Nigerians to emulate and revive the ‘Keffi spirit’, the Minister expressed the belief that if Nigerians do that, the nation would have “succeeded in reducing to the barest minimum the areas of friction and today’s atmosphere of ethnic and religious suspicion, disunity,etc, will cease to exist.” “Boko Haram insurgents will no longer be able to use religion as a source of division. Unscrupulous politicians will no longer be able to divide us using ethnicity,” Alhaji Mohammed said. Mohammed had insisted that Boko Haram terrorists were targeting Christians and their worship centres. Mohammed had alleged that the insurgents were trying to divide the country along religious lines, hence the target of Christians in the Northeast.

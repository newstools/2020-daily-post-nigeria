The Chief of Naval Staff, CNS, Vice Admiral Ibok-Ete Ibas, Monday, warned that the service would impose severe sanctions on commanders and commanding officers found guilty of indiscipline, fraud or connivance with criminals in the performance of their duties. Ibas also warned that the practice of ratings solely bearing the brunt of misconduct would be discontinued because the Commanders would, henceforth, be held responsible for the conduct of their men. Naval spokesman, Commodore Suleman Dahun disclosed this in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja. Dahun stated that Ibas gave these warnings during his maiden meeting with the frontline naval commanders, some of whom, he affirmed were newly appointed. Further, Ibas charged Commanding Officers of Forward Operating Bases and Commandants of Nigerian Navy schools and hospitals to prioritize training, integrity and teamwork towards sustaining the current levels of operational achievements. Vice Admiral Ibas also submitted that sustained operational successes were dependent on an effective operational framework involving senior leadership, principal staff officers at the Service headquarters, Flag Officers Commanding and resourceful frontline commanders. Besides, the CNS even enjoined the commanding officers and commandants to acquaint themselves with the CNS Strategic Directives and relevant Nigerian Navy statutes guiding their various responsibilities.

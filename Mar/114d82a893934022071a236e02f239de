The Kaduna Peace Commission (KAPECOM) has blamed scarcity of resources, ethno religious perception, youth restiveness, amongst others as factors fueling crisis in the state. The commission also vowed that, it’s gearing up to promote sanctity of human lives. Chairman of the commission, Archbishop Josiah Idowu-Fearon, expressed this at a press briefing held on March 4, 2020 at the commission’s office in Kaduna. “These drivers include competition over scarce use of resources, negative ethno-religious perceptions, youths restiveness and insecurity, among others,” he said. He informed that shortly, the commission will be embarking an aggressive engagement of key stakeholders in ensuring that that is peaceful coexistence in the state. “The Commission will deliberately promote the values of the sacredness of human life. Humans of all kinds are created by God Almighty with dignity and honour, and this need to be fully recognised and respected. No person has the right to take away human life, and this sanctity of human life must be inculcated in the minds and hearts of our young people. “As people of religion, I use this medium to appeal to all adherents of our religious faiths to think deeply and work out modalities for inculcating the right religious cultures among its followers. “I appeal to the religious leaders in Kaduna State and beyond, to work together to address perceptions that drive religious intolerance,” he said. He stressed that the commission in the ongoing efforts at strengthening the peace architecture in the state since its inauguration in November 2017, the commission has pursued deliberate efforts of engaging diverse stakeholders to promote a culture of dialogue, tolerance and understanding that will lead to peaceful and harmonious coexistence in the state. He therefore, advocated that all grievances, concerns and fears of communities should be addressed and resolved using non-violence means, mainly in the form of dialogue.

Bayern Munich striker, Robert Lewandowski, has revealed he was asked to join Real Madrid by Cristiano Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos following his side’s UEFA Champions League quarter-final 6-3 defeat against Zinedine Zidane’s side in April 2017. Lewandowski explained that he had no intention of leaving Bayern Munich after reaching his full potential with the Bundesliga champions, even though he was flattered by Ronaldo and Ramos’ desire to play alongside him at the Santiago Bernabeu. “Yes, Ronaldo and Ramos asked me to join Real Madrid,” the Polish striker told Sport. “You can play for Real in La Liga or another great club in another country. “But for me, it was not the most important thing, and where I am today, I have been able to reach my maximum level, and I want to continue doing well. “I am at one of the best clubs in the world presently, and I know I can be happy here at Bayern. “We are at a very high level, from the playing squad to the sporting facilities. “It is all much easier when playing for a club like this,” he said. Lewandowski has scored 230 goals in 275 games for Bayern Munich since joining the Bavarians from Dortmund. The 31-year-old has won seven Bundesliga titles, three German Cups, and four German Supercups.

Chelsea players were instructed not to report for training on Thursday, amid a major coronavirus scare, the UK Times reports. It is understood that someone “close to the squad” complained about COVID-19-like symptoms and a decision was made on Thursday morning to cancel training. The unidentified person is however yet been diagnosed with coronavirus. Chelsea players are due to train on Friday, ahead of Saturday’s Premier League match against Aston Villa. The club’s Cobham training facility will undergo a deep cleanse as a precaution, while Frank Lampard’s pre-match press conference is scheduled to go ahead as planned tomorrow.

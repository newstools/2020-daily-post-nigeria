The former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov, has predicted the outcome of this weekend’s big Premier League clash between Manchester United and Manchester City. Berbatov said the Red Devils are likely defeat their city rivals. The former Bulgarian international believes his former club will get a positive result from the game Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men go into the match three points behind fourth-placed Chelsea and will be desperate to keep up the chase. Pep Guardiola’s City side are seven points clear of Leicester but a massive 22 points behind Liverpool. “I am feeling positive ahead of this weekend’s Manchester Derby, you can see there is a lot of spirit there at the moment, but it is true, this is a different game,” Berbatov told Betfair. “City are not the same City from last season and they are suffering a bit in the shadow of Liverpool, which I’m sure has affected them as reigning champions. United can exploit this and take advantage of it because there are three points to take against them. “Both teams will want to win this game, but are City thinking more about winning the Champions League now that they know the league is won? I don’t think they will want to lose against United before they host Real Madrid in a couple of weeks. “For me this is a pretty even match and I think whoever makes the least mistakes will be fine.”

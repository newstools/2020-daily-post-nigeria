Ekiti State Governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, has assured that the autonomy granted some communities in the state was carried out to enhance development and bring government nearer to the grassroots.

The Governor made the remarks on Friday when he presented the instrument of appointment and staff of office to Oba Matthew Durojaye Jegede as the first Alahan of Ahan Ayegunle Ekiti in Ekiti East Local Government Area. Represented by the Deputy Governor, Otunba Bisi Egbeyemi, the Governor added that the exercise was not designed to breed hatred, rancour, nepotism and other negative dispositions that could negate harmonious coexistence with the former allied towns.

Fayemi enjoined the people of Ahan Ayegunle Ekiti to live peacefully with their neighbouring communities like Omuo Ekiti and Omuo Oke Ekiti stressing that the peaceful coexistence of people in the state is non-negotiable since it is the hallmark of development.

He used the forum to laud the contributions of the traditional institution to peaceful coexistence in the state describing it as a “veritable tool of governance” with its reconciliatory and advisory roles. The Governor enjoined Oba Jegede to exercise the divine power conferred on him with restraint urging the monarch to serve with diligence, sacrifice and perseverance, adding that the responsibilities of developing the town lies on his shoulders.

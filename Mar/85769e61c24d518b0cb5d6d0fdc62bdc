Manchester United players will train as normal, despite the Premier League suspending fixtures because of the coronavirus outbreak, the UK Mirror reports. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his players will stick to their daily training schedule at Carrington. There will be no games in England until April 3 at the earliest, which could lead to a drop in playersâ€™ fitness levels. But United want their squad to remain at peak levels, before the expected resumption of the season. United have however not decided whether they will arrange behind closed doors games at their trading ground to keep their players sharp. The Red Devils were due to face Tottenham this Sunday.

The Christ Embassy Church in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, today, disobeyed the directive of the Ogun State Government banning mass gathering to contain the spread of Coronavirus. DAILY POST reported that the state government on Friday banned worship centres from having more than 50 people congregating in one gathering at the same time. Our correspondent, who went round the state capital, observed that many churches complied with the directive. However, Christ Embassy did not comply with the order. When our correspondent visited the church at Plot 4, Gbolahan Adeyinka Close, off Quarry Road, Abeokuta, it was observed that worshippers in the church were far beyond 50.  Though people were given hand sanitizer at the point of entry, people in the church kept increasing. A fair-complexioned man, who spoke to our correspondent at the entrance, said there was a directive from CAN Abuja that churches can congregate. He almost had an altercation with our reporter when he observed he (reporter) was counting the number of worshippers in the church. Asked why the church had more than 50 worshippers, the young man replied, “You said they are more than 50, I don’t know if they are more than 50.”  In other churches like the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Overcomers Tabernacle, Onikolobo; St. Andrews Anglican Church, Ibara; Dominion Bible Church, Quarry road; the Glory Place Christian Centre, Onikolobo, the Gospel Faith Mission International, Oluwo junction, there was compliance. Our correspondent observed that many of the churches requested members to wash their hands and apply sanitizer before joining others. Majority of the churches do not have more than 30 worshipers as some sent back their members to avoid violating government order. At the Celestial Church of Christ, Ibara, there was no service at all, as the church was under lock and key.

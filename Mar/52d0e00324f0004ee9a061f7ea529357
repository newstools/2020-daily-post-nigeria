Chelsea legend and former Super Eagles captain, John Obi Mikel, has reacted to the death of Nasarawa United player, Chieme Martins. DAILY POST reported that Martins slumped and died during one of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) fixtures last Sunday. It was gathered that Martins collapsed after colliding with a Katsina United player. Efforts to resuscitate Martins proved abortive, as the defender eventually gave up the ghost before he was even rushed to the hospital. Reacting, Mikel Obi took to his Instagram page on Tuesday to mourn the late Martins. He shared his sympathy with the family and friends of the late 22-year-old star. The Trabzonspor midfielder wrote: “Rest in peace, my prayers and thought are with your family,” accompanied by a crying emoji on the picture of Martins.

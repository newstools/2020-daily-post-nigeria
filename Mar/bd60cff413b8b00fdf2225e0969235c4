Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, has dismissed speculations that they could miss out on their first Premier League title, should the season be cut short because of the spread of coronavirus. The Reds lost 3-0 to Watford last weekend, ending their hopes of matching Arsenal’s ‘Invincibles’. However, Klopp’s men are still 22 points ahead of Manchester City at the top of the table. There were reports over the weekend suggesting the rapid spread of coronavirus, which has forced a host of sporting events to be postponed or played behind closed doors, could impact the Premier League season. Asked by reporters if he had a message for any paranoid Liverpool fans, Klopp said: “I don’t think that our fans are paranoid, I think people who are not interested are bringing up these stories. “I can’t believe that Liverpool fans are thinking about it, and I actually speak to Liverpool fans. “If anybody wants to ask me about that, and how much sense it would make to delete all the results of this season and tell me who will play next year Champions League and stuff like this. Would be really interesting. “Nice story, always obviously some newspapers they always have to write something. “But when I saw it first time I really thought, “Wow! Really somebody thinks something like that?” But Liverpool fans are not silly enough to believe in these things.”

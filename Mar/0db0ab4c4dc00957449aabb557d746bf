Wife of the Anambra State Governor, Mrs Ebelechukwu Obiano has condemned the act perpetuated by one Onyinye Ugochukwu, a 21-year-old student of the Federal Polytechnic, Oko who recently delivered a baby in her boyfriend’s house and discarded same into the bush in Oko, Orumba North LGA. The baby, however, was held by the leg on a barbed wire on the perimeter fence of the empty plot of land which was over grown by bushes. Though Mr Obini Onuchukwu, the spokesperson of of Polytechnic had earlier insisted that it was not clear if the lady was a student of the institution, Police in Anambra has, however, confirmed that the girl has been arrested, but could not be paraded before pressmen because she was taken to the hospital where the baby was recuperating, where she is breastfeeding the baby. However, Mrs Obiano who spoke in Awka on Saturday condemned the act, asking young girls who plan to toe such line to rather package the baby in a manner that will guarantee warmth, and drop her where she could be found and taken care of. She also stated that she was ready to take care of such children, or even assist in finding orphanages that can help them, instead of seeking to terminate the baby’s life. Reacting to the news, she said, “This unpleasant news has almost soured my weekend. I can’t imagine such desperate act at a time when many families are earnestly searching for the fruit of the womb. “Please let it be known that rather than wasting their lives, many good Nigerians and CAFE are ready to assist and get such babies to appropriate orphanages.” She expressed relief over the news that the recovered baby is now stable and is responding to treatment. She also cautioned against recurrence, counselling that those thinking along that line should desist and do the right thing.

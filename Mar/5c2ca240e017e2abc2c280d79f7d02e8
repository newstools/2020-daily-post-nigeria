Former Manchester United star, Lee Sharpe, has urged the club to sign Aston Villa’s Jack Grealish as Paul Pogba’s replacement at Old Trafford this summer transfer window. According to Sharpe, Grealish would be a perfect replacement for Pogba and also a great addition for the Red Devils. Pogba has not played for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side since December 26 due to an ankle injury and is expected to leave the club at the end of the season. The 2018 France World Cup winner has drawn interest from Juventus and Real Madrid in recent months. “Jack Grealish is a class act,” Sharpe told GentingBet ahead of Man United’s Premier League derby with Manchester City on Sunday. “I love watching Grealish play. I believe he is fantastic on the ball; his vision and awareness are absolutely second to none. “And I think he would be there to replace Pogba. “If Grealish joins United and they are playing Fernandes, there is no room in the team really for someone like Pogba, and I feel that they will now have many creative midfielders. “I believe Grealish would do great at United, and he will be a great addition to the squad.”

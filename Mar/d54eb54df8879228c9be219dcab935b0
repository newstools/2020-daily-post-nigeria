Amid the legal and party battles the National Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, is facing, the National Working Committee (NWC) has insisted that no faction exists in the party. Lanre Issa-Onilu, National Publicity Secretary, said this in a statement Monday night. He said in a political organisation such as the APC, contestations are not unusual and are not necessarily intractable. Issa-Onilu noted that the issues being alluded to in the media reports are matters before the courts and should be allowed to run their normal and legal course. The spokesman called on NWC members to party’s secretariat staff to resume at their offices and continue carrying out their scheduled roles and responsibilities without any fear. He thanked the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Abubakar Adamu, personnel of the Police, Department of State Services and other Security Services “for their professionalism in the process of maintaining the peace and preventing hoodlums from fomenting trouble at the APC National Secretariat”. “We assure all our members in Nigeria and across the world that our leaders are capable of resolving any contestation that may arise bearing in mind the best interests of our great party and in the pursuit of progress and development of our country.” Meanwhile, some NWC have sent out invitation to an Emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) slated for Wednesday, 17th March, 2020. The meeting was announced by Hon. (Chief) Victor Giadom, APC Deputy National Secretary. In his reaction, Issa-Onilu stated that those calling for the meeting had no powers to do so.

Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN, has stated that he was not in any way connected with the dethronement of the former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II. Sanusi was dethroned on Monday, March 9 and banished to Nassarawa State. In a terse statement on Sunday by his spokesman, Umar Gwandu, Malami debunked allegations that he played a role in the the removal of the former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor. “The issue of who does what over the dethronement saga has been effectively submitted for judicial determination. The matter is consequently subjudice. “Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice will not comment one way or the other over a matter that is pending before the court”, it read. Sanusi was flown to Lagos Friday night. He would be living in the state henceforth. Earlier, he was moved to Loko, then Awe, both in Nasarawa, following his banishment. A High Court later freed him after ruling that restriction of his movement was a clear abuse of his rights. Sanusi’s dethronement has been widely condemned. In his reaction, Sanusi said he could get a favourable judgement if he challenged his ouster but that he doesn’t want to return to Kano as Emir.

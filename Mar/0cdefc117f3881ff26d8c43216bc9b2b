The Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, has appealed to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members in the South-West to unite and reposition the platform. He made the call at the PDP region’s stakeholders’ meeting attended by Olabode George, Eddy Olafeso, ex-Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose, among other party stalwarts. The parley was held at the Government House on Thursday in Agodi, Ibadan, the state capital. Noting that politics was a game of numbers, Makinde urged party leaders and members to accommodate each other. ”Let us not assume some people are bad because they have their own roles to play. So, I am for unity in the South-West and I have donated myself to pursue it for the region”, he said. ”In Oyo State, we have experienced disunity before and we know the implications. After the 2015 general election, we returned together and said we must not tread on that path again. “The only path to victory and success is to be united. Unless we begin to embrace ourselves at the moment of disagreement, we cannot be statesmen.”

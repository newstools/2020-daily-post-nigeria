When Nwamaka was offered a job in Europe, her father was wary of promises made by the recruiters. He knew that other families were sending young women to Europe with claims of employment abroad, but some of them died and many returned to Nigeria with nothing. Nwamaka’s father spurned the recruiters and chose to invest in her education in Nigeria. As a result, Nwamaka completed secondary school and went to university where she studied textiles. She now runs her own successful business and her father is chief of their village. “If I had sent my daughter abroad, would I be a chief here? No! I would have spoilt my family name,” Nwamaka’s father said. “There are a lot of opportunities for your daughters here. Don’t sell her future. My daughter, Nwamaka Ifeanyi, and your daughters are Not for Sale.” Nwamaka’s story is being highlighted as part of a campaign to help vulnerable young women who are at risk of human trafficking. Thousands of young girls are trafficked from Nigeria to Europe each year by criminal networks that lure them with job offers. Many of these girls are physically and sexually abused. Using the tagline ‘Not for Sale’, the campaign combats human trafficking by raising awareness of the training and job opportunities in Edo and Delta, which are notorious trafficking hotspots. The campaign is part of a partnership between the UK Government and Nigeria’s anti-trafficking authority the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP). ‘Not for Sale’ takes a new approach to prevent modern slavery by highlighting success stories of women who have succeeded in Nigeria rather than travelling abroad at the risk of compromising their safety and dignity.

Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State has debunked the report making the rounds that Mohammed, son of former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar attended the party’s rally in Ibadan before confirming he was COVID-19 positive. Recall that Makinde had apologized to Nigerians who slammed him for organizing a political rally in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. Following Atiku’s announcement that his son tested positive, there were different accounts of Mohammed’s movement after he returned from Switzerland. Spokesman to the former Vice President, Paul Ibe, has since cleared the air, saying that Mohammed isolated himself. The Chief Press Secretary to Governor, Makinde, Taiwo Adisa in a statement yesterday, debunked the report that Atiku’s son attended the rally. “We want to place on record for the notice of the general public that the information suggesting that the said son of Atiku was the same person that represented him at the Southwest PDP unification rally in Ibadan, Oyo state is false,” the CPS said in a statement on Twitter. “We have since confirmed that a different member of the Atiku family is the person so infected. The public should please ignore such unfounded rumor. Thanks,” he added.

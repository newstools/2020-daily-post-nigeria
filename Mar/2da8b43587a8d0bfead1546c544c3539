The founder of Mount Zion Faith Ministries, Pastor Mike Bamiloye, has claimed that the coronavirus is not rampant in Africa, because of fasting and prayers. Bamiloye stated this via a post on his verified Instagram page. Since its first incident was recorded in China last December, the virus has killed about 5,000 persons, with at least 134,000 infected. However, there is a low spread in Africa, a trend that has baffled foreign observers. Nigeria, for instance, has recorded two cases with the second now confirmed negative. “The scientists and health specialists in western nations are still wondering why the coronavirus has not spread massively in Africa as expected and I said, it’s God’s answer to our prayers and fasting. “And some people are angry with me. What did I do wrong now? If my answer is wrong, you should tell all of us why the virus has not spread in Africa as they expected,” Bamiloye wrote.

Owing to incessant fire outbreaks in the country, Senate Committee on Interior Monday, advocated for increased funding for the Federal Fire Service (FFS). Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Kashim Shettima, made the call during an oversight visit by members of the Committee to the headquarters of FFS in Abuja. Shettima said there was a remarkable change in operations of the Federal Fire Service, noting that more funds would enable the agency to acquire more sophisticated equipment. He, however, said there was a need for proper guidance given the workings of other Fire service in other countries. He said in comparison, the budget of the fire service of New York City was too large compared to the budget of FSS in Nigeria. “We would like to call on the Federal Authorities to really pump in resources toward revitalising and repositing the FFS. “We have to commend the management of FFS for doing an outstanding job in spite of the constraints, their working environment, paucity of funds and other challenges . “I believe they deserve commendation and not condemnation,” Shettima said. He said the senate would amend the laws to empower the agency in combating fire incidences. “My colleagues and I would work assiduously to see that the 1963 law, setting up this outfit is reviewed. “It has become obsolete, we need to review it in the light of current happenings in our environment. “We will also explore options in getting back remittances due to FFS from NAICOM and other agencies,” Shettima said.

Inter Milan winger, Ashley Young has offered some advice on staying safe during the coronavirus pandemic. DAILY POST recalls that all the major leagues in Europe, including Serie A, Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1 are on hold until April ending due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the continent. Italy is officially the worst-hit country by COVID-19, with over 4,000 people dead. Young, who left Manchester United in January to join the Italian Serie A giants, outlined a series of measures people all over the world should follow. The 34-year-old, in a series of tweets on his official Twitter page on Tuesday night, wrote: “Hi everyone, just wanted to share my thoughts on coronavirus. I’m currently living in Italy, the epicenter of the virus. “Realistically, a supermarket is now your main risk of spreading this virus and even catching it. Speaking with family and friends at home, it sounds like going to get food is just crazy. Remember, lockdown means lockdown! “This may sound harsh but treat everybody that’s not in your household as if they have the virus, and you don’t know. “Most importantly, stay safe, and this is what we are doing here. It’s not an overreaction; it is staying safe. “And remember others should be looking at you in this way as well. It’s not horrible, it’s a way of keeping your distance to help save lives ultimately.”

The suspect, who was identified as Adamu Musa, was arrested by operatives of Anti-Kidnap Unit of the Rivers State Police Command. The officer, who led the operation, told DAILY POST that Musa, who hailed from Gumbi Local Government Area of Adamawa State, led the operatives to the forest where their victim was killed along Eneka-Igbo Etche boundary between Obio-Akpor and Etche Local Government Areas of the state. The senior police office, who begged not to be named because he is not authorised to speak, said the suspected kidnapper, Musa has named other members of his gang.

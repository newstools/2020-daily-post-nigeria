Arsenal have confirmed that Lucas Torreira has suffered a fractured ankle. Torreira was stretchered off during their 2-0 win over Portsmouth in the FA Cup on Monday night. The Uruguayan midfielder stayed down following a heavy challenge after just 12 minutes and was replaced by Dani Ceballaos. Torreira underwent further tests at Fratton Park, before leaving the stadium on crutches, wearing a protective boot. Arsenal have now released a statement, confirming a fracture to his right ankle. The Gunners added that they were “awaiting further specialist reviews which will determine recovery plan”. The news will come as a big blow to manager Mikel Arteta, as he prepares his side for their Premier League home fixture against West Ham on Saturday.

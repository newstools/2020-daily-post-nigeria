Minister of State for Health, Senator Olorunnimbe Mamora, has cautioned Nigerians on the use of herbal products to protect themselves from Coronavirus (COVID-19). Mamora told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Forum on Tuesday that there have been so many claims by some Nigerians that bitter kola can be used to cure coronavirus. He, however, warned Nigerians against using many herbal drugs because none has proven to be effective. “It is true that bitter kola has anti-viral properties, but I am not sure how the anti-viral properties affect coronavirus. “I have also heard of garlic, lemon, palm wine and even chloroquine “We caution against the use of so many herbal drugs because science has a basis and there is a procedural process to laying claims to whatever,’’ he said. Mamora advised Nigerians not to panic, stressing that people should allow themselves to be “ruled by facts, not fears”. He said that the best prevention is to practice good personal hygiene by washing hands under running tap water with soap or ash, as well as the steady use of hand sanitisers. Speaking on Lassa fever, the minister said that the disease had reduced in the country. “There are three functional control centres in Edo, Ebonyi and Ondo. The country has the capacity to manage Lassa fever; more people are recovering from it. He advised Nigerians to practice good hygiene and also cover their foods properly. “With proper education, Nigerians will achieve a lot when it comes to diseases management,’’ Mamora added.

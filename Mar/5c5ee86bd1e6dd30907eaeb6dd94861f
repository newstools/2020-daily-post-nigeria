The Premier League will meet with clubs on Thursday, to discuss the fate of the current season. On Friday, at an emergency meeting, the Premier League decided to suspend fixtures until April 3 at the earliest. This followed Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea midfielder Callum Hodson-Odoi testing positive for the coronavirus. The statement also said the league will reschedule the displaced fixtures, including those played by academy sides, when it is safe to do so. However, another meeting will take place next week. Some clubs believe the season can still be completed if games start again on April 4. But others are ready for the possibility of there being no top-flight football, until the start of next season in August. Sky Sports claims a senior source at a Premier League club, says he believes there is a 75% chance this season will not be completed.

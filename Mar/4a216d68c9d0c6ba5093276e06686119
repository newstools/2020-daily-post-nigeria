The Federal Fire Service (FFS) has called for caution in the use of hand sanitisers amid the coronavirus outbreak. The FFS said sanitisers could cause fire incidents. Abdulganiyu Jaji, Head of the Inspectorate, Investigation and Enforcement Department, spoke at a low-key event to mark the 2020 National Fire Safety Week. Jaji represented the Controller-General, Mr Liman Ibrahim. He said the warning had become necessary as most hand sanitisers are highly inflammable and could easily start fires if not properly handled, especially by children. “The sanitiser we use contains chemicals which when exposed to fire can lead to fire outbreak. “That is why we have to be conscious of it. Most times, we see people putting the sanitiser outside the home-by the entrance. “This is to prevent the alcohol vapour from spreading inside the house,” he said. Jaji appealed to users of hand sanitisers to rub their hands properly until dry before going near fire. The official also urged them to keep cans of the liquid out of the reach of children. “Parents need to properly monitor their children because they can start fire incidents by playing with matches, electric appliances and other sources of ignition. He urged families have fire extinguishers and fire blankets to control fire in the kitchen. On Wednesday, the Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Frank Okiye, tested positive for the deadly diseases.

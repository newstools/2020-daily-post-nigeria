Former world boxing champion, Roger Mayweather, is dead. The 58-year-old uncle and trainer to Floyd Mayweather, passed on after battling with poor health. “My uncle was one of the most important people in my life inside and outside of the ring. “Roger was a great champion and one of the best trainers in boxing. Unfortunately, his health was failing him for several years and now he can finally rest in peace,” Mayweather Jr said in a statement. Roger was a two-weight world champion and fought 72 times during his 17-year career. His death comes a week after the death of Josie Harris, mother to three of Floyd Mayweather’s children.

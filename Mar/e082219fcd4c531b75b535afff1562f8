Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, is facing an uncertain future at the club, according to the UK Mirror. Aubameyang’s current deal at the Emirates will run out in the summer of 2021. But the Gabon striker wants Champions League football and has been linked with Barcelona and Real Madrid. However, both LaLiga clubs do not know what they are planning for, as the season has been called off indefinitely. The Spanish giants do not know when this season will restart or when next season begins, putting everything on hold. The COVID-19 outbreak has also affected club’s finances, with players urged to take pay cuts, as there is no incoming revenue. It is the same for football agents, who have had no guidance from FIFA, as to when the transfer window may open or close.

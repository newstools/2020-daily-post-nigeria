Filling stations in Cross River State have not adjusted their pump prices to reflect the new price announced by the Federal Government. DAILY POST who went round various filling stations observed that fuel was being sold at N145 per litre as against N125 announced by the Federal Government. Federal Government had on Wednesday announced the reduction on fuel pump price from N145 to N125 per litre but the owners of the filling stations refused to adjust their pumps to reflect the new price. A fuel marketer who declined to give his name said it will take filling stations’ owner up to three days or more to adjust their pump prices Some of the fuel dealers said selling at the new pump price would make them incur unexpected losses “We bought this fuel at a cost higher than what federal government has announced and until we exhaust that product, we cannot adjust our pump “Unless government pay us for the losses we would incur, we will not reverse to new pump price’’ he stated. A customer who gave his name as Okon Etim Akpan urged the federal government to ensure that filling stations adjust their pump to reflect the new price. “Federal Government should come down on these people, if not they will continue to exploit the people. We cannot remain silent on this. “If the price was to be adjusted upward or increase, the owners of filling stations would have adjusted the pump price before we know it. “These people must be made to comply with immediate effect. Failure to do that must attract sanction” he said He asked the federal government to set up a task force to enforce compliance as failure to do this; the people will continue to suffer.

Tyson Fury’s cut-man, Jacob ‘Stitch’ Duran, has dismissed allegations that the ‘Gypsy King’ tampered with his gloves in the victory over Deontay Wilder. In recent days, footage of Fury throwing open-palmed hooks at Wilder has been circulating on social media. Wilders’ fans believe that Fury’s fists were not fully fixed into his gloves and that this gave him an edge over his opponent. Duran, however, stated that the Nevada State Athletic Commission oversaw all aspects of the Briton’s gloves being put on. “I’ll give you the facts, it wouldn’t be no thoughts,” Duran told Boxing Social. “The Nevada State Athletic Commission is one of the best commissions in the world and they handle the gloves until it’s time for them to put them on, so there was no tampering whatsoever. “I was there and that was all just a big myth, dispel those myths, those rumours, it didn’t happen. “That’s why you have your inspectors there to make sure that everything is followed within the guidelines and none of that happened. But it’s good for discussion.” The professional cutman further stated that the allegation will “fade away”. “It’s not even true, not even close to being true. Maybe it’s the tough shots that he hit him with that loosened up the glove – and I’m just saying that in kidding – but none of that ever happened.”

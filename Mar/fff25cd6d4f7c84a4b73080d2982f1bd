Dethroned Emir of Kano, Alhaji Muhammad Sanusi, has arrived at his new home in Loko, a town in Nasarawa State, where he was banished to by the Kano State government. News Agency of Nigeria, NAN, reports that Sanusi arrived his new residence at about 3 a.m. on Tuesday morning. Confirming the development, the traditional ruler of Loko, Alhaji Abubakar Ahmed Sabo said Sanusi arrived his palace “around 3 a.m. on March 10″. The first-class traditional ruler, however, said that the press would not be allowed to interview the dethroned emir. “Yes, Emir Sanusi is in my palace. He arrived this morning around 3 a.m., but no one will be allowed to speak with him,” he said. Recall that the Governor Abdullahi Ganduje-led State government had yesterday dethroned Sanusi as Emir of Kano. The government had explained that Sanusi’s removal as Emir was due to his “outright disregard for the state government and Kano Emirate’s traditional norms”. Shortly after he was dethroned, the former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, the state government had announced one of the sons of late Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, Aminu Ado Bayero as the 15th Fulani Emir of the state. Against the backdrop of his dethronement, the former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, was banished from the State.

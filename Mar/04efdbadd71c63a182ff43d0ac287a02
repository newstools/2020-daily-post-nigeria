According to the Kwara State police command’s spokesman, Mr Ajayi Okasanmi, massive deployments have been effected “all over the state and enforcement is under the strict supervision of the commissioner of police himself.” On the level of compliance, Okasanmi said, “You know it is just starting, compliance is, however, encouraging. “The challenges most times is the tendency of some citizens to want to wait till the eleventh hour before complying, waiting to observe police action,” Okasanmi added. DAILY POST reports that most streets were deserted as early as 6 a.m with commercial vehicles including Okada and Keke Napep operators disappearing from the streets.

The Supreme court, Monday resolved to adjourn hearing to March 17, on the applications seeking a reversal of its judgment over the contentious gubernatorial and other elections held in 2019 general elections in Zamfara State. It would be recalled that the verdict of the apex court had invalidated the elections in favour of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state on grounds of improper conduct of primaries ahead of the said elections. Consequently, the APC lost the governorship and House of Assembly seats to the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, at the instance of which, Bello Muhammad Matawalle, member of the PDP became the incumbent Governor of the state. However, the ruling APC recently made an approved application seeking a review and reversal of the judgment by the apex court. At the resumed sitting today after the counsels from the appellant and respondent announced their appearances, Mike Ozekhome who represented the respondent counsel, Tim Inuwa affirmed that they were not served the court processes and hearing notice relating to the applications. After an ensued legal firework between Ozekhome and appellantâ€™s counsel, Chief Robert Clark, SAN, the apex court adjourned the hearing to March 17, to enable the respondent counsels be served with the said documents.

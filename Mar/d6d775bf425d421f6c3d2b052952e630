Former Super Eagles captain, John Mikel Obi, appears to have been made the sacrificial lamb, after the Turkish Football Federation (TFF) finally decided to suspend the Super League, TFF 1. League, TFF 2. League and TFF 3. League over the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. At the meeting chaired by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday, a decision was taken to postpone the fixtures to a later date. Before todayâ€™s decision, the Turkish Super Lig and the Belarusian Premier Leagues were the only leagues in Europe that were in action, despite the outbreak of the COVID-19. Mikel Obi was the first Turkish-based player to go public with his criticism of the Turkish Federation. The Nigerian captain eventually had his contract terminated by mutual consent. The 32-year-old also forfeited all his future earnings with the league leaders.

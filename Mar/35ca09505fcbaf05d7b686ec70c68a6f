Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has reacted to the comment by the Sultan of Sokoto, Sa’ad Abubakar that hunger was more deadlier than Coronavirus. Sani urged the Sultan to stop talking about hunger in Nigeria to avoid being attacked. Recall that the Sultan had earlier stated that poverty and hunger was killing Nigerians more than the deadly Coronavirus. Abubakar had stressed that what a lot of Nigerians are facing in terms of hunger and other challenges was much more deadlier than the Coronavirus. The monarch stated this on Thursday at the first quarterly meeting of Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) in Abuja. However, Sani, who took to his Facebook page, urged the Sultan to stop criticising government. Sani’s comment which he wrote in pidgin and was translated in English language reads: “Please your Highness Sultan stop talking about hunger in Nigeria so they don’t come for you. “So they won’t say you are the contortionist or what do they call it. As they returned home in anger, make sure you just chill.” Meanwhile, former Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Lamido Sanusi, who is known for criticising Northern state government over the poverty rate in the region was on Monday dethroned by the Kano State Government.

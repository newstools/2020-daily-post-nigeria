Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, has lost another aide, Dr Amos Itihwe. The deceased, one of his Executive Assistants, died on Monday in Warri. Itihwe, the EA on Political Matters, is Okowa’s third aide to pass away within one week. On Monday, Okowa announced the death of two aides, Friday Akpoyibo and Godspower Muemuifo. Both died on March 8 and 4, respectively. The governor, in another condolence message on Tuesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Olisa Ifeajika, described the death of Itihwe, as “sad and painful’’. He said Itihwe, was a Commissioner on the Board of Delta State Oil-Producing Area Development Commission (DESOPADEC), representing Ughelli South, Udu, Uvwie and Urhobos of Warri South. The governor called him an asset to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and one of the greatest contributors to its winning streaks in Ughelli South. “Buoyed by the love for his people, he sought to represent them at the House of Representatives when he contested the party’s primaries for the Ughelli/Udu Federal Constituency but was not successful.” The message noted that as pioneer Chairman of the PDP in Ughelli South Local Government Area, the deceased laid the foundation for the election victories the PDP has been recording in the area since 1999. “He was a very strong believer of the Okowa vision and has been a pillar of support for the Stronger Delta agenda of our administration. On behalf of my family, the government and people of Delta, I mourn the exit of a loyal, trusted aide and confidant. “Dr Amos Itihwe, whose sad demise occurred on Monday, March 9, 2020, at Lilly Hospital, Warri, after a brief illness, will be sorely missed by the party in the local government,” he stressed. Governor Okowa prayed to God to accept the deceased’s soul and grant family and friends fortitude to bear the loss.

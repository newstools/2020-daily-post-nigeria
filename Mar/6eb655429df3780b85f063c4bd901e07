Governor Abdullahi Ganduje-led governement on Monday dethroned Sanusi as Emir of Kano for being disrespectful to lawful authorities. Meanwhile, former Governor of Kano State, Rabiu Kwankwaso, on Wednesday alleged that President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the removal of Muhammadu Sanusi as Emir of Kano.

Chelsea Manager, Frank Lampard, has provided the latest injury update on striker, Tammy Abraham after his side failed to beat Bournemouth in the Premier League on Saturday. Abraham was absent as Chelsea played a 2-2 draw away at Bournemouth, thanks to two goals from Marcos Alonso. The 22-year-old was seen limping away from a warm-down exercise after Chelsea’s midweek 3-0 loss to Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League. Providing an update on Abraham, Lampard said the 22-year-old has flown to Barcelona to see a specialist for advice on his ankle injury. “Tammy Abraham went to Barcelona, to have a look at his ankle for some more advice on it,” Lampard was quoted by Metro UK as telling reporters after Chelsea’s draw with Bournemouth. “I’m hoping it’s not a long-term injury, but I can’t tell you if he’ll be ready for Tuesday or Saturday matches.” Abraham has been impressive for Chelsea so far this season. He has scored thirteen Premier League goals so far this campaign.

Residents of Ebrumede Community, in Uvwie Local Government Area of Delta State, on Monday found beheaded corpse of a lady near the popular Vita Foam office, along the ever busy DSC Expressway, a distance not too far from the Ebrumede Police Station. It was learnt that the beheaded corpse, which was seen naked, was dumped at the middle of the highway by suspected ritualists on Sunday night. Our Correspondent who visited the scene reports that there was no blood stain on the floor to indicate that it may have been a motor accident. A wrapper which was used to cover the body was blown off by the wind. Road users who spoke to DAILY POST appealed to the appropriate authorities to evacuate the body, pointing out that it is an eyesore for both children and adults plying the route. The Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Mohammed Hafiz Inuwa is yet to respond to telephone calls for confirmation of the report.

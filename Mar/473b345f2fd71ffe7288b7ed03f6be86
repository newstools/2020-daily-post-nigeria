The United States Department of State has placed a $7million (N2.5billion) bounty on the head of Boko Haram’s leader, Abubakar Shekau. The Rewards for Justice Program (RJP) announced this in a tweet. It read: “The United States Department of State offers a reward up to $7m for information leading to the arrest of the terrorist, Abubakar Shekau, leader of Boko Haram.” In June 2013, the US had also placed a bounty of the same amount on Shekau. The Boko Haram leader was named a “specially designated global terrorist” on June 21, 2012, under executive order 13224. Shekau became leader of the insurgent group in 2010, after the death of Mohammed Yusuf, its former leader. His whereabouts have remained unknown for almost a decade.

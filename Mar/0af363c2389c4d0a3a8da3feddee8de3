The Department of State Services (DSS) has debunked reports that its personnel attached to the President killed the intruder that tried to break the security cordon on President Muhammadu Buhari at Argungu, Kebbi State. DSS denial was contained in a statement signed by its Public Relations Officer, Dr Peter Afunanya. It said the suspect, one Mohammed Jammil Guddare, made a futile attempt to have an unauthorized handshake with the President. The DSS said Guddare was arrested by security operatives for thorough investigation. The Service also said they have reviewed the video of the incident and are taking measures against its personnel found to have been negligent in their duties. The statement read, “The Department of State Services wishes to dismiss reports making the rounds that presidential details killed the intruder that tried to break the security cordon to attack the President and Commander-in-Chief, Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR at Argungu, Kebbi State on 12th March 2020. “Preliminary investigation reveals that he is not a hostile person but an overzealous enthusiast of the President. “The Service has reviewed the video of the incident and is taking measures against its personnel found to have been negligent in their duties.” The report went viral on Friday that the man, who was later identified as Jammil Guddare, furiously leaned forward in the President’s direction as he posed for photographs with some farmers. The Presidency had since defended Guddare, saying he was only a desperate fan who wanted to have a handshake with his hero. Although the suspected attempted attacker had also explained that he wanted to have a friendly handshake with the President, many Nigerians who saw the video still believe there are more to it.

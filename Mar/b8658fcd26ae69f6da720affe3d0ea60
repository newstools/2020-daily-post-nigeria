Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Bala Elkana, in a statement on Sunday, said that the suspect resides at No. 10, Olalemide Street, Aboru. He quoted the girl as saying the deceased, who was her father’s friend, invited her to his house to assist him in fetching water, as he lived in the house alone. “She has always been helping him with house chores and while she was helping out with the water on Saturday, he attempted raping her. “She picked a knife from the room and stabbed him. The suspect was taken to hospital for medical and forensic examinations,” he said.

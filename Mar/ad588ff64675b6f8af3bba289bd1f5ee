Reigning WBC heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury, has confirmed that he would seriously consider retiring after his next two fights. According to Fury, he would go into training young boxers after hanging his gloves. The British fighter defeated American boxer, Deontay Wilder, in the 7th round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, USA, last month to regain the WBC world heavyweight title. The 31-year-old will again fight Wilder for a third time this summer after Wilder’s camp officially triggered his rematch clause. Fury and Wilder’s first bout ended in a classic draw in December 2018. He will have just one fight left on his contract after his trilogy fight with Wilder in July. “Yes, I have got two more fights left, and then we are going to think about what we are going to do from there,” Fury told ITV’s This Morning. “I am undefeated from 31 fights, and I have been a professional for 12 years. “Hopefully, I will have two more fights and then sail into the sunset.” Fury added: “I am opening up a local boxing club now, I am in the process of doing it. “Like I had a chance when I was a kid to walk in a boxing club and become who I am today, so I can give someone else the opportunity to do the same thing. “You never really know what a child can achieve when given an opportunity.” Meanwhile, Tyson Fury’s promoter, Bob Arum, has confirmed that the newly crowned WBC champion is targeting fights against both British boxers, Anthony Joshua and Dillian Whyte, once he has seen off Wilder again in July.

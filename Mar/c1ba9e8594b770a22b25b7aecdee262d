Communities in Bauchi State have been charged to expose perpetrators of violence against women so they would be punished accordingly by authorities. Participants at a stakeholders dialogue meeting on realizing the rights of women in Bauchi State, organized by a non governmental organization ‘Fahimta Women and Youth Development Initiative’ (FAWOYDI) in collaboration with Actionaid, on Tuesday, as part of the celebration of this year’s international women’s day gave the charge. They advocated that women should be supported to actualize their full potentials by allowing them to acquire education, work in the formal sector and participate in politics and governance like their male counterparts. Earlier in her address, the executive director, of the Fahimta Women and Youth Development Initiative, Hajiya Maryam Garba said that the meeting was aimed at advocating a call to action for accelerating gender parity in order to eliminate violence against women and girls. She said that reports from security agents and civil society groups working on human rights and protection had indicated the alarming rate of domestic violence, rape and molestation towards women and girls that had been recorded across divergent communities in Bauchi state. “The problem we are facing in Bauchi State is that of barriers to gender equality and low participation of women in politics, as well as lack of support for empowerment of women and girls. Under the control of economic resources, the women are left to make ends meet with low economic resources, whose proceeds are spent taking care of the family,” she said During the event, the Regional Head of Child Education and Crime, Northeast, Hajiya Binta Adamu and a female police inspector on crime, Noami Emmanuel stressed the need for proactive measures to be taken in order to tackle the menace of gender violence, particularly against women and girls. They shared experiences of handling rape cases where the suspects were being shielded from prosecution because they were connected, pointing out that parents whose children were victims of sexual abuse should be bold enough to expose the perpetrators by reporting such cases to the relevant authorities, rather than covering the case because they were ashamed. While saying that survivors were subjected to various forms of psychological trauma, neglect and discrimination while perpetrators went free in the communities, they called on mothers to give their children sex education early so that they can resist the temptation of receiving gratification from men who want to abuse them sexually.

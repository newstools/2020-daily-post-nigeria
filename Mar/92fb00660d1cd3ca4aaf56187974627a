Aide to President Muhammadu Buhari on Social Media matters, Lauretta Onochie, has reacted to news of Governor Nasir El-rufai of Kaduna State testing positive for Coronavirus (COVID-19). DAILY POST recalls that El-rufai was confirmed positive on Saturday as NCDC recorded its first case in Kaduna State. As of today, Nigeria has 97 cases of patients with COVID-19 as the nation struggles to curtail the spread of the deadly virus. Reacting to El-rufai’s statement on Twitter, Onochie, on Sunday, prayed for the speedy recovery of the governor. She, however, said that Nigeria needs El-rufai because he is a fighter. “Our thoughts and prayers are with you, Mallam @elrufai,” Onochie tweeted. “You’re a fighter. We know you’ll beat this one as you have fought and beaten every challenge along your life path. “Not just Kaduna State, but Nigeria needs you. So, Get Well Soon.” Meanwhile, most markets and states have shut down in the fight against the spread of Coronavirus.

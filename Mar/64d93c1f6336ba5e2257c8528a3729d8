Security operatives on Tuesday night allegedly shot one Gene Ajour dead in Delta Stay community. Two others were declared missing at the time the incident occurred along the river in Okpogbene community in Warri South-West Local Government Area of Delta State. It was learnt that the deceased and the two others were conveying about five drums of products suspected to be kerosene in a speed boat when the security operatives who were on patrol on the waterway flagged them down. It was learnt that the deceased refusal of an order to stop the speedboat made the security operatives who were in their gunboats to open fire directly on them and killing one instantly. The remains of the two others who are believed to have died are still missing in the river. The incident caused serious tension within the area especially amongst traders, indigenes and residents who are now afraid of the security operatives. The Commander of the Nigerian Navy Ship, NNS Delta, Rear Admiral Ibrahim Dewu did not pick calls nor respond to text message sent to his phone number. The Delta State Commissioner of Police, CP Mohammed Hafiz Inuwa, is yet to comment on the matter.

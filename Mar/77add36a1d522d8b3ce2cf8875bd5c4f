Recall that Abba Kyari had allegedly tested positive for COVID-19. The report stated that President Buhari was also tested for the disease on Monday but his results came back negative. Reacting, Adeyanju attacked Nigerians who mocked Kyari for contacting the disease. He said Kyari went to Germany in search of solutions to Nigerian’s electricity problem. “You may not like Abba Kyari but he went to Germany to get a solution to our electricity problem. “If we can’t show empathy, let’s please keep quiet. You can be next. My prayers are with him & his family

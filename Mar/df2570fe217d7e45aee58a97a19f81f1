Two persons have been reportedly killed on Tuesday night during a clash of supremacy between two rival cults in Kpansia area of Yenagoa, the Bayelsa State capital. DAILY POST gathered that the two persons were shot dead in parts of the Kpansia school field. One of them was identified as Prince, who they claimed is a second-in-command to one of the notorious cult groups in the state, but the other is still unidentified. The said Prince who was killed, DAILY POST gathered, worked in the area as a security guard. DAILY POST also gathered that the killing at Kpansia has thrown the residents of Kpansia, Biogbolo and Yenezue-gene communities into fear. A Bayelsa based blogger, Bodmas kemepadei, while confirming the development, told DAILY POST that “As I write, some business owners in the above places have locked up their shops for fear of attack. “There have been reported cases of several cult clashes; a young boy was killed yesterday at Kpansia, others injured. The situation is becoming worse. “I wish to utilize this opportunity to appeal to His Excellency Governor Douye Diri, to please arrest the situation, I propose the immediate re-organisation and constitution of the Bayelsa State Volunteer and vigilante network as a matter of urgency. “The Police force should also be strengthened and provided with the necessary equipment to allow them perform effectively. More importantly, a peace and conflict resolution team cutting across all party lines, should also be constituted.” Every effort to reach the State Command, Police Public Relations Officer, Asimin Butwatts, was unsuccessful as he neither picked nor returned his calls.

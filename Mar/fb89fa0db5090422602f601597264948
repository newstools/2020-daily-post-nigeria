A former speaker of Imo State House of Assembly, Acho Ihim has said he remains the most qualified aspirant in Okigwe zone to replace the late Senator, Benjamin Uwajumogu. He stated this on a phone chat with our state correspondent on Monday March 16, 2020. The former lawmaker said out of the six local government areas that make up the zone, it is only Okigwe LGA that has not produced a representative of the senatorial zone, a situation, he noted was unfair to the people of the area. He argued that Okigwe is the parent LGA among the six council areas, regretting that it has been marginalized and not integrated in the scheme of things. “You can agree with me that Imo North is known as Okigwe zone but that, to me, has not made any meaning since the people have not been given a sense of belonging.” “All other LGAs in the zone have gone for two times except Okigwe. All we gain is to answer the head and be treated like the tail.” “Mind you, it must not be me. All I’m advocating for is that an Okigwe son or daughter be allowed to go for the sake of equity.” “I must tell you that I have all it takes to represent my people at the National Assembly. I started as a chairman of my LGA to the state House of Assembly where I rose to the position of the speaker. During my time as the speaker, I was elected the President of African Parliament. What other qualification does one need to represent a people?” Buttressing his point, he said that the seat was not earlier zoned to Ihitte-Uboma where the late Senator hailed from, adding that it was true a political manoeuvering that it got to them. Meanwhile, he has called on other aspirants to step aside in the spirit of equity. Although, he admitted that everyone is free to express their willingness to go.

Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, is one of the players that is likely to miss the end of this season if the campaign is extended, the UK Sun reports. The Premier League on Friday, suspended all fixtures until April 4 at least. However, that timeline could yet be moved, as the UK and other countries battle the coronavirus pandemic. The Premier League will need to reschedule fixtures, without it having an impact on next season. However, it will leave the future of some players in limbo, with their contracts expiring at the end of June. Ighalo signed a six-month deal with United when he joined from Shanghai Shenhua in January. Other stars who could be affected include Manchester City’s David Silva, Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen and Chelsea’s Willian. Ighalo has four goals in three starts for the Red Devils.

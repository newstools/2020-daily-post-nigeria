The police on Wednesday arraigned Lere Olayinka, spokesman to former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, in an Ado-Ekiti Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court for alleged N13.5 million fraud. The prosecutor, Insp. Johnson Okunade, told the court that the defendant committed the offence between 2014 and 2018 at the Broadcasting Service of Ekiti State, (BSES) Ilokun in Ado-Ekiti. Okunade alleged that the defendant, as a public officer abused his office when he failed to remit revenue accrued to the Broadcasting station to the tune of N13.5 million to the account of Ekiti State Government. He said the defendant, being the Director-General of the Broadcasting station, abused his office when he authorized travelling allowance of N7m in his name for journeys not embarked upon. He added that Lere also allegedly stole and converted N13.5m belonging to the Broadcasting Station to his own personal use. The prosecutor noted that the offence contravened the provisions of sections 104, 390(5) and 419 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ekiti State, 2012. He asked the court for an adjournment to enable him to study the case file and present his witnesses. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charges. But Counsel to the defendant, Former Attorney-General of Ekiti State, Mr Kolapo Kolade, prayed the court to grant his client bail in the most liberal terms. Ruling, the Chief Magistrate, Mr Adesoji Adegboye, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N1 million with two sureties in like sum having verifiable addresses in the sum of N500,000.

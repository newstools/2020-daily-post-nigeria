Former Manchester United striker, Dimitar Berbatov has given his verdict on the club’s January signing, Odion Ighalo. Berbatov said Ighalo has proven him wrong with his performances for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side so far this season. The ex-Bulgaria international said this ahead of Man United’s Premier League derby with Manchester City on Sunday evening. Ighalo joined the Red Devils during last January transfer window from the Chinese league. The Nigerian striker has scored three goals for United so far this season. “I am happy to see that Odion Ighalo is settling in well and he deserves it with the way he is playing,” Berbatov told Betfair. “How he links the plays and the goals he is scoring. All the team are happy when he scores which shows he is fully integrated, and I like the way he looks for the ball and bullies the defenders. “I’ll be honest, I didn’t know too much about him before he joined, obviously I knew about his record in the Premier League, but I questioned if he was the right man and if he would get into the team, but so far he is doing well and proving me wrong.”

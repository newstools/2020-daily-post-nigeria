Nigeria’s Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, has disclosed that President Muhammadu Buhari administration would take strong enforcement on religious leaders and Nigerians, who defied orders to stay away from large gatherings following the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in the country. He also stated that the government is doing its best to control the spread of coronavirus in Nigeria but needs the citizens to do their best too. Mohammed said during a press conference in Abuja on Thursday. DAILY POST recalls that the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria presently stands at 51. While two patients 8 people have been discharged, Nigeria recorded one death. “Let me say, without mincing words, that we are not getting the kind of cooperation that this moment [of coronavirus outbreak] deserves from Nigerians. Many people are busy engaging in meaningless criticisms instead of complying with the stipulated directives to keep people safe. “Some Nigerians defied orders to stay away from large gatherings while some religious leaders willfully flouted the directives to ensure social distancing. “The government is doing its best, but we need the citizens to do their best too. We have now gone past the stage of persuasion. It’s time for strong enforcement,” the statement read.

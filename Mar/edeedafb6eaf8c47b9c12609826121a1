There was drama at one of the private radio stations in Akure, the Ondo State capital on Wednesday, when one of the media aides to Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu angrily stormed out of a live radio program. The media aide, who is the Senior Special Assistant to Governor Akeredolu on new media, Gani Mohammed Ajowa, was a guest of a live program on Breeze FM. During the live program, he engaged in a hot argument with another guest who represented the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Leye Igbabo. It was gathered that the duo were invited to appear on the programme to examine the 3rd anniversary of Oluwarotimi Akeredolu’s government. The radio programme, ‘Fire 4 Fire’ was anchored by a renowned radio broadcaster in the state, Adebisi Ajiboye, popularly known as Sogigun. The situation in the studio became charged when Igbabo described Ajowa as a politician who works with the highest bidder. Ajowa who found the statement disrespectful and insulting told Igbabo that he lacked respect for elders. Efforts by Igbabo to explain to him that the statement was not insulting were unsuccessful. According to one of the members of staff of the radio station who craved anonymity, all efforts by the anchor, Sogigun to calm Ajowa down proved abortive.

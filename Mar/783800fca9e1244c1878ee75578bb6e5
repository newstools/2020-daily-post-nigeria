Real Madrid defender, Sergio Ramos, has blamed himself and his teammates for not showing more intensity and fighting harder against Real Betis following their La Liga 2-1 defeat on Sunday night. According to Ramos, the Los Blancos were not good enough against the host, adding that they relaxed a bit at the back during the encounter. Real Betis defeated Real Madrid at the Benito Villamarin Stadium, thanks to two goals from Sidnei and Cristian Tello. Karim Benzema did score for the Zinedine Zidane’s men. “It is football, and when we do not do things like we have been doing all week,” Ramos was quoted by Real Madrid’s official website as saying after the match. “Real Betis played their football, and we have been very up and down, we had good spells in the match, but not enough. “The result is quite fair, and we have to look at ourselves. We have not been good enough. There is still a lot to play for in LaLiga, we did not get any points to defend the top position, and now it is our turn to keep on picking up three points. “We relaxed a bit at the back. We needed to show more intensity against them, we should have fought more, but it was not to be. “Just like we did not lose our heads against Barcelona. “There are eleven matches to go, and many points still to play for. If we want to be champions, we can not let opportunities pass us by.” Ramos will now hope to lead Real Madrid to victory when they take on Manchester City in the Champions League round of 16 second-leg tie at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night.

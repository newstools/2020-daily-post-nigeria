The Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) Friday enforced the new pump price of fuel in some petroleum stations in Anambra State. Mr Okiemute Akpomudjere, Operations Controller, Awka Area office, DPR, represented by Mr Victor Ojiakor, Manager Operations who led a surveillance team, said marketers in Anambra must operate under the rules guiding the sector or face the wrath of the law. The DPR monitored sale at a good number of major and independent retail outlets where they forced erring marketers to reset their machines to N125 and supervised sales. It was discovered that most filling stations were still selling at N145 and those who claimed there was no stock had their tanks dipped. Akpomudjere said the regulatory agency was worried that the price review which was made to mitigate the pains of Nigerians at this time was being flouted insisting that buyers of petrol must have the full value of their money. “We have gone round Awka metropolis to see the level of compliance to the new approved pump price and also to enforce that it is obeyed here. “From our visits, a few of them have adjusted but some were still selling at N145 but as our responsibility, we had to force them to change and sell at the new price regime which is a new policy. “As a regulator, the DPR want to see that the new price is respected, that customers enjoy the accruing benefit as envisaged by the federal government. “We want to warn those who are still flouting the order within our area of operations to do the needful or face the sanctions which range from sealing to withdrawal of operating licenses,” he said.

Arsenal players are set to return to training next Tuesday, following their period of self-isolation due to the coronavirus outbreak, Sky Sports reports. The Gunners boss, Mikel Arteta, tested positive for COVID-19 last week. The news led to the Premier League postponing all fixtures until at least April 4. Since then, all Arsenal players and backroom staff were forced into a 14-day self-isolation period. The two weeks end on Tuesday and as things stand, the clubâ€™s London Colney training base will reopen and training will resume ahead of the planned home game against Norwich on April 4. Arteta is understood to be feeling better and in good spirits.

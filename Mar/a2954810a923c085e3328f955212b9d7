UEFA president, Aleksander Ceferin, has said Liverpool will not be awarded the Premier League title, if the coronavirus pandemic forces the season to end abruptly. English football fixtures are currently on suspension until April 4, because of the COVID-19 outbreak. The Reds are 15 points clear at the top, but are not assured of being named champions for the first time in 30 years. Ceferin has now waded into the argument on whether Jurgen Klopp’s men should be given the trophy, if the fixtures are not completed. “I’ve seen and heard some again fake news that UEFA will advise leagues to finish the championships now and decide that the winners are the ones who are number one now. “I can say that it’s not true. Our goal is to finish the leagues and we didn’t recommend anything like that to any association or league,” Ceferin said according to Daily Mail.

Tyson Fury’s promoter, Bob Arum, has confirmed that the newly crowned WBC champion is targeting fights against both British boxers, Anthony Joshua and Dillian Whyte once he has seen off American fighter, Deontay Wilder again in July. DAILY POST recalls that Fury is set to fight Wilder again after Wilder’s camp has officially triggered his rematch clause. The 31-year-old British fighter defeated Wilder in the 7th round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, USA, last month to regain the WBC world heavyweight title. “I agree with WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman and what he has said regarding Tyson Fury,” Arum World Boxing News. “Fury will fight Wilder in July. He could then possibly fight the Anthony Joshua vs. Kubrat Pulev winner in November. “Then Dillian Whyte in February. Why not?”

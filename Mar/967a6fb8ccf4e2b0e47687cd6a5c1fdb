Governors of North-Eastern states will meet in Gombe on Thursday. Top on the agenda is insecurity in the region. Ismaila Misilli, spokesman to Gombe Governor, Inuwa Yahaya, made this known in a statement. He added that the meeting would also discuss other regional challenges bordering on the economy and infrastructure. Other issues to be discussed included the discovery of hydrocarbon deposits in the North-East, prospects and problems of power generation, and the role of Distribution Companies. “The Governors will receive presentations from the North East Development Commission (NEDC), on exploring the potentials of the commission for infrastructure and human capital development of the sub-region. “At the end of the meeting, the governors will issue a communique outlining areas of common interests and agreements among the six North-Eastern States of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Yobe and Taraba,’’ he said. Misilli said that the meeting was expected to set the stage for regular engagements and consultations among governors in the region. The North-East has witnessed an increase in attacks, a situation decried by the international community.

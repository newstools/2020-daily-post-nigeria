Anthony Martial and Aaron Wan-Bissaka were not pictured with the rest of the squad, as Manchester United players flew out on Wednesday afternoon, ahead of their Europa League last-16 clash with LASK. Martial did not train at Carrington during the open session and is a doubt for the game in Austria. However, Odion Ighalo made the trip and is very likely to start for Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s men. Jesse Lingard and Diogo Dalot were also not spotted as part of the travelling squad. Tahith Chong has made the trip to Austria along with fellow youngsters Mason Greenwood, Brandon Williams and Angel Gomes. United go into the game unbeaten in their last 10 fixtures in all competitions. Confirmed United squad members to face LASK: De Gea, Romero, Bishop, Williams, Lindelof, Maguire, Shaw, Tuanzebe, Bailly, Gomes, Pereira, Matic, McTominay, Fernandes, Fred, Mata, Greenwood, James, Chong, Ighalo

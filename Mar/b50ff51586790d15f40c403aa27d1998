The Minister of Information and Culture, Alh. Lai Mohammed has said the military and the police would be involved in tracking some Nigerians who made contact with people with Coronavirus. Mohammed made the disclosure at a briefing in Abuja, on Monday. He spoke while expressing worries that more than 1,300 contacts who have dissolved into the society and yet to be traced. Speaking during a press conference in Abuja, the Minister said: “We should be ready for tougher measures. The forms they will take will be out from the end of today or tomorrow. But Nigerians should be ready for tougher measures. “If we don’t do proper contact tracing, the figure will multiply every five days. Nigerians must take ownership of this initiative. “We won’t hesitate to use whatever measure to ensure that you do not endanger other Nigerians. Containment is very cheaper than cure. “A few people have helped. If you know you traveled recently, give yourself up to relevant agencies. ”If the situation warrants, we may be forced to use the police and the military for contact tracing. The police is already working on that. We don’t want the figure we have now to multiply. We should work towards containment which is cheaper.”

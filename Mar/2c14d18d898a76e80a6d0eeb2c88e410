The Catholic Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Reverend Callistus Onaga has ordered all parishes in the diocese stop placing holy water at the entrances of the church. Reverend Omaha in a statement released on Saturday in Enugu State said the move is part of measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 in the state. The cleric said it was also necessary because of the churchâ€™s tradition of people touching holy water at church entrances and making the sign of the cross on their faces, NAN reports. He urged priests to thoroughly wash their hands before distributing Holy Communion as well as avoid touching the tongue of recipients in the process. Onaga advocated for constant washing of hands with antiseptic soap, especially after using the toilet, counting money, playing with a pet or visiting a sick person to contain the spread of the Coronavirus. Onaga warned priests and religious groups visiting sick persons to be extra cautious by wearing mouth covers and hand gloves while administering sacrament to them. The Catholic Prelate added that more stringent measures might be put in place as the situation developes.

Former Super Eagles player, and Assistant Coach, Daniel Amokachi, has named former Chelsea midfielder, John Mikel Obi, as the greatest Nigerian player ever. Amokachi, who was recently appointed as Nigeria’s Football Ambassador by President Muhammadu Buhari, believes Mike Obi is ahead of Nigerian legends, Austin Jay Jay Okocha and Kanu Nwankwo because of his achievements in football so far. “Mikel Obi is the greatest Nigerian player,” Amokachi told Brila FM. “He has won everything that a player can hope to – the Champions League, Europa, AFCON in 2013, and he also captained the national team. “As a footballer, your laurels count, and that will surely count for Mikel because nobody has won that much in Nigerian football.” Mikel Obi retired from international football in 2019 after leading the Super Eagles to win the third-place bronze medal at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt. The former Trabzonspor star has won nine major trophies in his career so far, including Champions League, Europa League, and two Premier League title

Belgian-born Heracles Almelo striker, Cyriel Dessers has reacted to his call up to the Super Eagles. Dressers, who has netted 15 goals for the Belgian side this season, said he is excited to receive his first ever invitation to the Nigeria national team. The striker who has a Belgian father and a Nigerian mother was invited ahead of their Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Sierra Leone on March 28. The 25-year-old Dessers tweeted, “So honoured and proud. Can’t wait to wear the Green-White jersey and meet the team! @NGSuperEagles #naija.” Head coach of the Super Eagles, Gernot Rohr, named 24 players for the game against Sierra Leone. FC Cologne’s Kingsley Ehizibue and Heracles Dessers are the new additions to the team. Leicester City forward, Kelechi Iheanacho, also makes his return to the team. However, Paul Onuachu, Henry Onyekuru and Francis Uzoho have all been left out.

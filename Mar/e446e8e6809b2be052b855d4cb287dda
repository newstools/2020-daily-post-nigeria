The Nigeria Police have deployed more officers and men to the national headquarters of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja. Although, the building is usually under police protection, more personnel have been sent there. This might not be unconnected to the court order which suspended National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. FCT Police Public Relations Officer, DSP Anjuguri Manzah, told DAILY POST Wednesday night that the deployment “is a normal police routine”. Justice Danlami Senchi of FCT HIgh Court, earlier in the day, told Oshimhole to stop parading himself as the party’s leader. He ruled in the application filed by Mustapha Salihu and five others through their counsel, Oluwole Afolabi. The plaintiffs contended that Oshiomhole is currently suspended and was yet to challenge his suspension as a member of the APC by Etsako ward 10 in Edo State. The judge asked the APC to desist from acknowledging the former Edo governor. He also warned the ruling party not to grant Oshiomole access to the national secretariat.

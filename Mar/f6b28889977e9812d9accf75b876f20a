UEFA president, Aleksander Ceferin has predicted that the 2019/20 Champions League and Europa League could resume in mid-May, June or late June. DAILY POST recalls that the Europe top-flight competitions were suspended earlier this month due to the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) across the world. “We could start again in mid-May, in June or even late June,” Aleksander Ceferin told Italy newspaper, La Repubblica daily. “Any time after that and “the season will probably be lost.” He added: “There is also a proposal to end this season at the beginning of the next one and then start the next one a little later.” Meanwhile, Belarus remains the only European country still playing football despite the COVID-19 pandemic that has officially claimed around 28,000 lives worldwide.

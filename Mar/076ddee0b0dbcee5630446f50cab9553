The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, has dismissed claims by Junaid Mohammed, Second Republic lawmaker that Muhammadu Sanusi’s lineage can never become Emir in Kano again. AYCF President-General, Yerima Shettima stated that contrary to Mohammed’s opinion, Sanusi’s children or grandchildren can still emerge as Emir of Kano. In a chat with DAILY POST, Shettima explained that Sanusi’s grandfather was an Emir but failed before he got to the throne. Recall that the Kano State Government dethroned Sanusi as Emir of Kano for insubordination. Following the dethronement, Mohammed had declared that the lineage of former Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, can never become Emir. In an interview not with DAILY POST, Mohammed had said: “I don’t believe any line of his family can be emirs again because we have tried them twice and they have been a woeful disaster. He is out of touch of realities in Kano and in the North and none of the people want to impose themselves on the North.” Reacting, the AYCF President-General insisted that it is within the right of Sanusi’s family to emerge as Emir of Kano. When asked to react to Mohammed’s comment, Shettima said: “I don’t know the yardstick with which he made that assertion and I don’t think it’s so. “His grandfather was an Emir before him, his father didn’t succeed but he succeeded so it’s possible his child or grandchild will become Emir because it’s within their right. “It’s politics, we are going to lobby and we have those who still believe that justice should be done in the North.”

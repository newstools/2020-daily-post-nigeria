The Chairman Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) in charge of the 19 Northern States and Abuja (FCT) Rev. Yakubu Pam, has applauded Christians in the North for adhering to Federal and States Government’s precautionary measures in curbing the spread of COVID-19 in the country. He also noted with joy how Christians in the North respected government’s restriction, particularly in their various places of worship and maintaining the social distancing outlined by Government. Pam on Monday commended President Muhammadu Buhari for the measures taken so far to halt the spread of COVID-19 disease in the country. He said, “I am impressed with the conduct of Christians in the North and Nigeria at large for complying strictly with Federal and State Government’s directives in trying to stop the spread of coronavirus pandemic in the country. “Churches have respected the restriction with regards to Sunday worship and other Church activities. I encourage all Churches in the North to continue to adhere with these measures and pray fervently for God to do away with the disease.” According to him, the broadcast of President Muhammadu Buhari on the COVID-19 pandemic was well packaged with laudable initiatives geared towards curbing the disease in Nigeria. Pam said the package will help in cushioning the effects of the stringent measures on Nigerians. The Northern CAN chairman also said that the body under his leadership has come up with strategies to sensitize and create awareness among Christians in the region to complement government’s directive. He prayed fervently for a quick recovery of those who have tested positive and asked God not to allow the disease ravage Nigeria as it has in some developed nations of the world.

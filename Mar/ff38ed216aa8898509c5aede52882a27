There was excitement in the Ogun State political space as Gov Dapo Abiodun and his predecessor, Sen. Ibikunle Amosun, were captured in a warm handshake. DAILY POST reports that it is their first handshake since Amosun left office barely 10 months ago. The friendship between the two went sour during the 2019 governorship primary election of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State. Today, the duo of Amosun and Abiodun met at the wedding ceremony of former Governor Gbenga Daniel’s son’s in the Lekki area of Lagos State. The event also had in attendance, the Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed; the Senator representing Lagos West, Solomon Adeola, Paramount rulers from Ogun, among other dignitaries. Observers are of the opinion that Amosun and Abiodun’s cheerful handshake and the excitement that followed, might bring an end to their political differences.

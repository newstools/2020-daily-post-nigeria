Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, has made a N50m donation to fight Coronavirus across Southeast Nigeria. Kanu made the announcement in a broadcast via Radio Biafra, on Friday, stressing that the sum was from the coffers of IPOB. Kanu disclosed that part of the donation will be used to ensure some hospitals in the Southeast are equipped to fight COVID-19. He said: We never knew that the virus is coming, we have commitments all over the world, we are committing initial N50 million to make sure we educate and prepare our people for what is to come. We budget N300m for the fight against Coronavirus. “We will establish one hospital in every state of Biafra including Edo State. We are going to open food store for the people. If you are to confine the people at home, you must make sure they don’t die of hunger. We are even going to feed those who are not IPOB members. This is what advanced countries are doing for their people. “I am worried for Africa and humanity but my primary concern is for the people of Biafra.”

Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has praised his “forward-thinking” midfield, following their 4-0 win over Everton on Sunday. Mason Mount, Pedro, Willian and Olivier Giroud all scored, as the Blues won convincingly at Stamford Bridge. The victory took them to within two points of third-placed Leicester. With Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho out in midfield, Lampard opted for Billy Gilmour, Ross Barkley and Mason Mount. Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Lampard admitted he was worried whether they would be able to handle both offensive and defensive phases. “When you pick a midfield like we picked, particularly that area with players that are very forward-thinking – there’s two eights in our team – you do worry about the defensive nature of the game. “But we were spot on every part of our game, not just the midfield three but the team, the attitude, the focus and, to be honest, we’ve played like that a fair bit at home this year but we haven’t had that last bit which is the unpredictable bit. “Today we had it but the overall performance was brilliant,” he said.

The convener of Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju, on Tuesday reacted to the dethronement of Muhammadu Sanusi as the Emir of Kano. Speaking exclusively with DAILY POST, Adeyanju said President Muhammadu Buhari should stop Governor Abdullahi Ganduje-led government from using security operatives to trample on the rights of Sanusi. Recall that the state Government had Monday dethroned Sanusi as Emir of Kano. Following his dethronement, the state government immediately named one of the sons of late Emir of Kano, Ado Bayero, Aminu Ado Bayero as the 15th Fulani Emir of the state. Against the backdrop of his dethronement, the former Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, was banished from the state. Reacting to Sanusi’s banishment by the state government, Adeyanju said Buhari should ensure that security agents are not used against the former Emir. According to Adeyanju: “The dethronement is okay. We have nothing against it. What we are more concerned about is the unlawful arrest and detention of the Emir, and we are really looking at the human right angle. “We just wrote a letter to the president now, urging him to kindly direct action on the petition that if Sanusi’s unlawful arrest and detention continue, it would violate his rights to liberty, freedom of association, movement and assembly. It would also amount to some forms of discrimination in line with section 35 of the constitution. “The president has to ensure that the Kano State Government does not use security operatives to trample upon the rights of the former Emir. Security agents were used to unlawfully arrest and detain the former Emir and this goes against every constitutional provision that Sanusi should naturally enjoy.”

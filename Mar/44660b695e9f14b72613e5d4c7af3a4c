Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has confirmed that both Willian and Mateo Kovacic, suffered Achilles’ injures during their 2-0 win over Liverpool in the FA Cup on Tuesday. Willian, who opened scoring in the game, went down off the ball less than five minutes into the second half. Kovacic had already gone off before the interval, after he was tripped slightly by Reds youngster, Neco Williams. The Croatian midfielder initially carried on, but had to be helped from the pitch. “Both have got an Achilles’ issue. “Willian hopefully is not too bad, that is what he is reporting there so we will see how he is tomorrow. Kovacic’s feels slightly worse. Hopefully not too drastic, so we’ll see,” Lampard told reporters afterwards.

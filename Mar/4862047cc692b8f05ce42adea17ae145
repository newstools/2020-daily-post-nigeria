The Lagos State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria, CAN, has faulted the call for ban on religious activities in the country, following the outbreak of Coronavirus. Chairman of CAN in the state, Apostle Alexander Bamgbola, made the remark shortly after the House of Representatives advised that places of worships should be shut down from the outbreak of the disease in Nigeria. However, Bamgbola, while addressing journalists on Wednesday in Lagos, urged government to do everything possible to win the war against the disease. Bamgbola stated that the level of Coronavirus infection across the country does not yet warrant ban on religious gathering and activities. He also urged churches and mosques to take proactive measures in safeguarding their members from getting infected. According to Bamgbola: “The Federal Government must further secure our borders. Many nations are doing this very seriously now. We must also act now as a nation. CAN LATEST NEWS ON COVID-19“Our nation cannot afford to welcome or accommodate coronavirus in our land.

Amnesty International has spoken on decision of the Kano State Government led by Governor Umar Ganduje to remove Muhammadu Sanusi as the Emir of Kano. Secretary to the Government, Usman Alhaji, on Monday, announced Sanusi’s dethronement. He accused the former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor of disrespecting “lawful instructions from the office of the Governor and lawful authorities including his persistent refusal to attend official meetings and programmes organized by the government without any lawful justification which amount yo total insubordination”. The SSG stated that in many instances, Sanusi “breached part 3 section 13 (a-e) of the Kano State Emirate law 2019 and which if left unchecked will destroy the good and established image of the Kano Emirate ” “This removal is made after due consultations with the relevant stakeholders and in compliance with part 3 section 13 of the Kano State Emirate law 2019 and other reasons stated above.” Reacting on Tuesday, Amnesty International called on Nigerian authorities to respect Sanusi’s human rights, right to dignity, freedom of expression and freedom of movement. “Restricting the former emir and placing him incommunicado violates his human rights as protected under the constitution and international human rights law”, a statement by AI spokesman read. “Amnesty International calls on the Nigerian authorities to take steps to protect and respect the former Emir’s fundamental human rights in accordance to the rule of law.” Hours after Sanusi’s removal, the Ganduje government announced Aminu Ado Bayero as the new Emir of Kano.

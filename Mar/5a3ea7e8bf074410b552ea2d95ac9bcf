Liverpool ace, Mohamed Salah, has surpassed former Reds strikers, Luis Suarez and Fernando Torres’ goals record after scoring a goal in his side’s Premier League 2-1 win against Bournemouth on Saturday, Metro UK reports. Two goals from Salah and Sadio Mane ensured Jurgen Klopp’s side defeated Bournemouth in front of their home fans. Salah’s goal against Bournemouth means the Egyptian international has now become the first Liverpool player since Liverpool former striker, Michael Owen, to score 20 goals for the Anfield club in three successive seasons. Salah is arguably one of the most prolific goalscorers in world football since he joined the reigning UEFA Champions League winner in 2016 from AS Roma. The former Chelsea star scored 44 goals in 52 games in his first season at the club. He also scored 27 goals in his second season at Anfield. The forward has now scored his 20th goal this season on Saturday against Bournemouth. Salah will hope to lead Klopp’s men to victory when they take on Atletico Madrid in their next fixture in the UEFA Champions League round of 16 second-leg at Anfield on Wednesday.

Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has cautioned security agencies to be friendly in enforcing the lockdown effective Tuesday. The order was announced on Sunday by President Muhammadu Buhari. It also affects Abuja, Ogun and seeks to curtail the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). Sanwo-Olu, during a Security Council meeting held at the State House, Marina, on Monday, urged the operatives to show civility in dealing with erring persons. He observed that the world is watching and that high-handedness may lead to violation of human rights of residents. Commissioner of Police, Hakeem Odumosu, declared that the presidential directive would be fully implemented. Odumosu said that commanders of each security agency had resolved to comply with the governor’s message. Noting that the enforcement would be executed with professionalism, he pleaded with citizens to exercise self-compliance. ”They must try as much as possible to comply voluntarily to the laid down regulations, so that we can collectively defeat the pandemic,” he said. The ComPol assured that those exempted in the presidential directive would be allowed to move unhindered. Odumosu said such persons included certain professionals and government officials on essential duties. The Police boss advised their leadership to obtain clearance from security agencies before sending out staff to work. ”The exemption is not blanket. Some other measurements will still be attached to it and sent to various government ministries in the state. ”The Commissioners will have to review and confirm those who are exempted are actually qualified to be exempted,” Odumosu added.

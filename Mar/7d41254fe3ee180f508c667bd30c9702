Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar, has returned to his native Brazil, due to the coronavirus pandemic, ESPN reports. Neymar left France with his international team-mate, Thiago Silva, before the country went into lockdown on Tuesday. PSG gave all the players permission to leave the country and self-isolate where they wanted or stay home in Paris. It is believed that another of Neymarâ€™s compatriot, defender Marquinhos chose to remain in France over returning to Brazil. The players have been given instructions by the PSG coaching staff to maintain their fitness levels. These plans include eight minutes of warm up, 10 minutes of doing weights (pushing at least their own weights or more), 40 minutes of running on the treadmill with a change of pace and five minutes of warm down.

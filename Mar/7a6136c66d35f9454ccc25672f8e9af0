Former Nigeria captain, John Mikel Obi, has denied that Chelsea owner, Roman Abramovich, asked him to return to the club and take up a coaching role. There were speculations that Mikel Obi had been approached, to either work in the Blues’ Academy or as an assistant in the first team. It was believed to be Abramovich’s reward to a player who spent 11 years at Stamford Bridge. But Mikel Obi, speaking with AOIFootball, described the rumours as “lies”. He said: “Honestly, I do not know where such stories are emanating from. I’m surprised at the news because no such discussion or meetings have taken place between me and the club’s hierarchy as regards any form of coaching job. “Chelsea will forever be like home to me and if such contact were made I would gladly make it known but for now they are all lies and rumours.” Mikel Obi is expected to return to action this weekend for Trabzonspor after serving his suspension, following his red card against Caykur Rizespor.

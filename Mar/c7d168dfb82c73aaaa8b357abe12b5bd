Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has refused to blame goalkeeper Ederson, following their 2-0 defeat to Manchester United on Sunday. Anthony Martial’s volley squirmed under Ederson’s body to give United a 1-0 lead. The Brazilian also almost allowed Joao Cancelo’s back pass slide under his leg and into the net. Ederson’s throw out in the final minute went straight to Scott McTominay, who lifted the ball into the net to make it 2-0. Guardiola, speaking to Sky Sports afterwards, hailed his goalkeeper as, “extraordinary”. The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss said: “He’s an extraordinary keeper. That’s the only thing I can say. “It’s part of the game so next time he’s going to do better. He’s an extraordinary player. The way we played needed the build-up, sometimes it happens.” It is the first time City have lost in the league at Old Trafford since 2015.

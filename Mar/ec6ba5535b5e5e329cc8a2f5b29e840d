Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, has admitted that he has a selection problem with his strikers. Arteta started Eddie Nketiah against West Ham in the Premier League, after the 20-year-old scored in the 2-0 win over Portsmouth in the FA Cup. However, Nketiah struggled to impress against the Hammers and was replaced early in the second half by Alexandre Lacazette. Lacazette, who has endured poor form lately, struck the winner for the Gunners as they kept their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League alive. Speaking to reporters after the game, Arteta said about Lacazette: “I have two strikers that are making things very difficult for me which is a good thing. “I saw straight away he was alert, focused and determined.”

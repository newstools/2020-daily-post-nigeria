Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has backed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men to finish in the third position on the Premier League table ahead of Leicester City and Chelsea this season. Neville said this ahead of Man United’s Europa League round of 16 first-leg tie against LASK on Thursday. Man United are currently in the fifth position on the Premier League table with three points behind fourth-place Chelsea and eight points behind third-place Leicester City after 29 matches. Asked if Manchester United should be aiming third place ahead of Leicester City and Chelsea, Neville told Sky Sports: “Absolutely. “Manchester United have got a game against Tottenham Hotspur next week, and that is a big match because if Tottenham wins, they go within a point of United. “Then United have, on paper, a favourable run of fixtures which they should be happy about.” Man United finished in sixth position on the Premier League table last season and missed out on the Champions League 2019/20 season. The Red Devils still have hope of qualifying for next season’s Champions League if they finish ahead of Leicester City or Chelsea this season.

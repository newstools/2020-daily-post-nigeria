Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodinma, on Friday, sworn in Justice Ijeoma Agugua, as the first female Chief Judge of the state. Agugua replaces Justice Paschal Nnadi, who retired from service. Speaking at the ceremony in Owerri, Uzodinma assured that judiciary under his time will be different. He vowed to make the Imo State judiciary one of the best in the country and also make it autonomous. “Judiciary is an important arm of government, and if our democracy must grow with its attendant dividends, we must have an efficient judiciary”, he said. “This is why every government must take seriously the leadership and membership of the judicial arm of government,” “I am not unaware of the little bickering here and there in the past, the past government in the state could not foster a robust relationship with the judiciary, in my own time, it will be different.” Uzodinma urged Agugua to improve on all those things her immediate predecessor put in place and possibly drive new ideas that will take the state judiciary to greater heights. “I will give you all the necessary support to ensure that you have an outfit worthy of commendation,” the governor promised.

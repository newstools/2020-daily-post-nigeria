Tougher times history may have shown reveal better leaders. The political exploits of the PDP in Benue State would not be successfully scribed without recourse to the 2015-2019 era that was predicated with and admixture of losses, pains and finally victory. To many, the outcome of the 2015 elections was what the Benue PDP would never recover from. It was the last stroke to break the camelâ€™s backbone. There was an emergency and tasking vacuum created by the then chairman, Emmanuel Agbo. More challenging was the fact that the party was bedevilled with monumental losses at the polls. There was a curious search for who could man up to the responsibility. With proficient knowledge of developmental and contemporary politics, John Ngbede enjoyed popular support to emerge Chairman. Not oblivious of the challenges that lay in wait, he did not have to think a second to deploy his sagacity on the job. He repositioned the party for greater exploits and the outcome of the 2019 elections speaks volume on what his style brought home. John Ngbede successfully fathered the family in her lowest moments, rebuilt confidence, earned popular support and marched the party in a vociferous battle of victory. Long before this time, Ngbede a grassroots party man had excelled at different fora of responsibility and became the political arrow head in Agatu. From Agatu, he explored the bigger stage and rose to national and international affluence. With such excellent performance and weeks to the wake of the Benue PDP Caucus, it is only wished that, Ngbede be permitted by the party to ride on for another term to consolidate on his sterling achievements of rebranding and sustaining the party for bigger things. He is more or less a round peg in the round hole.

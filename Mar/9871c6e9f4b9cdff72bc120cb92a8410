Reacting to the development, Ezekwesili, in a tweet on her Twitter page on Tuesday, prayed for Kyari’s safe recovery. She wrote: “We wish the Chief of Staff to @NGRPresident and all others who are receiving care for #CoronaVirusPandemic, speedy recovery. “All those who know they were in contact with Mr. Kyari should immediately take the @NCDCgov recommended mandatory Self-Isolation. “Stop risking yours and others’ lives. All who are acting irresponsibly at a time of a Pandemic must know that their education should be questioned.” Meanwhile, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Nigeria presently stands at 42.

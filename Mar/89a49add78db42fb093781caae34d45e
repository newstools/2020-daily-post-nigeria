Management of the National Youth Service Corps has debunked reports making the rounds that the scheme has postponed 2020 Batch A orientation programs. NYSC in a statement by its Director, Press and Public Relations, Adenike Adeyemi (Mrs) described the reports as false and misleading. The scheme noted that 2020 Batch “A” Orientation programme, scheduled to commence nationwide on 10th of March, 2020, will still hold despite the Coronavirus scare. NYSC advised all intending corps members not to panic, adding that preventive measures have been adopted by the scheme at all camps. The statement read in part: “Management of the Scheme wishes to assure Nigerians, especially the Prospective Corps Members (PCMs) that like it happened during the outbreak of Ebola virus, a hemorrhagic fever with devastating consequences, the Corps has been in liaison with the Federal Ministry of Health. “As a proactive action, it has put in place certain preventive measures in the thirty – seven Orientation Camps of the Scheme, in order to guard against the contraction of the highly contagious virus by the Corps Members. “In addition to the above strategy, the NYSC Secretariats had since stepped up the sensitization of serving Corps Members, as well as other Nigerians on things to know about the virus, particularly the preventive measures to be adopted. “Accordingly, Management wishes to emphatically state that the Orientation Course for the 2020 Batch “A” Corps Members shall hold nationwide as earlier publicized. “Kindly disregard the hoax created by mischief-makers to cause unnecessary anxiety among the PCMs.”

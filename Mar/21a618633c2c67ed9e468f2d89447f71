Former Manchester United defender, Gary Neville, has compared striker, Odion Ighalo, with Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez after the Red Devils’ Premier League derby 2-0 win against Manchester City on Sunday. Ighalo came off from the bench in the 88 minutes as Man United defeated Pep Guardiola’s men at Old Trafford after goals from Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay. But Neville believes Ighalo will have a better impact at United than Lukaku and Sanchez, who left the Theatre of Dreams last year to join Inter Milan on permanent basis and loan, respectively. “A player with desperation and work ethic with less talent will do better at any club than a player that got more talent than we have had at Man United,” Neville told Sky Sports. “Think of Lukaku being here and Sanchez being here and players like that over the last few years who have not wanted to be here. “They have done okay for the club, Lukaku in particular, but if they do not want to be here, they are going to have a damaging effect in that dressing room, and Ighalo is going to have a brilliant effect in Man United dressing room.” Odion Ighalo has scored three goals for Man United since joining the club last January transfer window. The Nigerian striker will hope to lead Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side to victory when they face LASK in the Europa League on Thursday.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday condemned Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for holding a unification fally in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, amid coronavirus outbreak. The party said the event was held at a time countries all over the world were taking deliberate, coordinated and concerted measures to contain the global outbreak of coronavirus. APC noted that the disease had forced Nigeria to cancel the scheduled National Sports Festival, NYSC Orientation Camps as well as a travel ban on government officials and travellers from 13 countries. APC spokesman, Lanre Issa-Onilu, said PDP’s thoughtless action was shockingly at variance with the current world effort to contain this pandemic. “Events in most countries of the world and instructions being given by the Nigerian government do not support this criminal activity. Obviously, the PDP is incapable of applying itself to rules and commonsense”, it read. “As the APC-led government is making efforts to put in place a new national order for good governance and patriotic citizenship, PDP, living up to its legendary infamy, has continued in its malicious ways. “How could any group choose this period to pull a crowd together? What is at stake at this moment that requires this level of risk taking? Why do the leaders of PDP not realise this action is capable of putting the entire country in jeopardy?” The APC called the PDP a badly behaved and clueless opposition party with irredeemable tendency for taking actions that violate all known moral principles. It urge well-meaning Nigerians to plead with PDP leaders to be responsible for once and apply some intelligence to their actions.

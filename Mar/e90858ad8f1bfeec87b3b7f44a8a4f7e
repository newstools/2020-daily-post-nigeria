The Emir of Borgu, His Royal Highness Muhammed Haliru Dantoro, has approved the immediate suspension of five senior Councillors of the Emirate. This followed allegations that they allowed Fulani herdsmen enter communities within the Emirate. The sanction was announced on Sunday by Abubakar Jibrin, Private Secretary to the Emir. A statement he issued explained that the suspended Councillors’ action was contrary to the directives of the Borgu traditional ruler and the Niger State Government. He said the decision was taken at an emergency meeting held at the Emir’s Gbemusu Palace. “HRH announced the suspension of Wazirin Borgu, Ubandoman Borgu, Madakin Borgu, Garkuwan Borgu and Sadaukin Borgu with immediate effect. “Furthermore, a five man committee has been constituted by the Emir to investigate the activities that led to issuance of letters and subsequent entry of some Fulani into Borgu Emirate. “The members include: Alh. Adamu Dodo (VC – Borgu Local Govt) as Chairman, Alh. Adamu Isah (Iyan Borgu), Mallam Saifullah Haruna, Mallam Abubakar Sadiq (Feby President) and Alh. Idris Isah (Danburam Borgu) as Secretary,” it read. The committee has one week to submit its report for further action. The monarch appealed to the residents of Borgu to remain peaceful and law-abiding. Emir Dantoro assured that he remained committed to “securing their lives and properties without any compromise”. In February, the Niger House of Assembly urged the State Government to declare state of emergency in the state.  The call was made in response to the insecurity in local government areas including Shiroro, Munya, Rafi, Paikoro, Borgu, Magama, Mariga and Kontagora. The lawmakers demanded strategies to stop bandits’ attacks as well as and stiffer punishments for criminals and their informants.

Tottenham Hotspur captain, Harry Kane, would consider a summer switch to Manchester United, Goal reports. It is believed that Kane would prefer not to stay at Spurs, while they undergo a squad rebuild after this season. The England striker wants to start winning trophies and is ready to join a club that offers him a better chance. Kane’s current contract expires in 2021 and Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, will demand a big fee to part with the player. Stadium debt and the threat of missing out on the Champions League, means that Spurs could be working with a reduced transfer budget. There are suggestions it could be as low as £50million ($64m). Also, United’s chances of land Kane could be significantly improved, if Mauricio Pochettino becomes their manager.

Two persons were on Friday killed in a fatal accident involving two vehicles and a tanker at Kwata junction, on Awka-Onitsha Expressway in Anambra State. Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Anambra Commander, Mr Andrew Kumapayi, who confirmed the incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said the accident, which occurred at about 10:57.a.m could be attributed to over-speeding and loss of control. “The fatal crash involved a tanker with registration number ENU921ZK, a truck with registration number XQ679EPE and a Toyota Hiace bus without a visible registration number. “The crash which also involved a total of 18 people – 14 males and 4 females, led to the death of two persons and four others sustained various degrees of injuries. “The injured persons have been taken to Princeton Orthopaedic Hospital, for medical attention while the corpses of the deceased have been deposited at the mortuary,” he said. Kumapayi, therefore, warned drivers against speed limit violations and to shun all forms of dangerous driving that could only lead to avoidable road mishaps and deaths.

Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has warned his players that they will look to Manchester United on Sunday, if they feel the game is more important to the Red Devils. City go into Sunday’s Derby, knowing they have little to no chance of catching runaway leaders Liverpool, who hold a 22-point lead over them. Guardiola’s side are however ahead of fifth-placed United with 15 points, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men fighting to play Champions League football next term. “When we believe it’s more important for them, we’re going to lose. “We have to have belief that it’s more important to us. I’ve never played a game thinking about points or that the game is more or less comfortable. “I’ve said many times about the determination we’ve shown in these moments, the desire and commitment in every single game, not just for the last year,” Guardiola told a press conference on Friday.

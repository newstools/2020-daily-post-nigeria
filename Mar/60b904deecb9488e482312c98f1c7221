Some Landlords and house owners in Okoria community in Agudama-Epie, Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa State, protested against the alleged forceful eviction and demolition of their property by the Central Naval Command in Yenagoa. The angry landlords marched through the Melford Okilo Road and terminated at the Government House in Yenagoa, on Thursday. They also appealed to the Governor to intervene and prevail on the Naval Authorities to stop the planned demolition of their houses and forceful take over of their properties. The aggrieved protesters carried placards with different inscriptions such as ‘we no go gree , our sweat no go go in vain’, ‘they want to destroy our property, Mr. President and Governor please save us’, and ‘we say no to oppression, Nigeria Navy you can’t destroy our houses without compensation’ amongst others. According to Asaye Ebikebina and Emmanuel Efrisou, “Men of the Central Naval command had given us until this Saturday to demolish their property without compensation while the matter is still in court. “Where is such thing done in this country, has the level of lawlessness, relegated to that point? There should be agreement between people before anything is done and not by force. Mrs. Sokore Blokore, a aged woman with six children said she lost her husband recently and has no where to go to if the house built by her daughter, also now late is demolished. In his view, a landlord, Mr. Christopher Brik, whose house had already been demolished noted that he has been going through a lot since his house was demolished. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Domestic Matters, Mr. Lucky Yubogha commended the protesting landlords for their peaceful and orderly conduct, promising to table the issue before the Governor. When DAILY POST contacted, the Spokesperson for the Central Naval Command, Sub Lieutenant Patricia Dike, promised to get back for the Navy’s reaction to the allegations.

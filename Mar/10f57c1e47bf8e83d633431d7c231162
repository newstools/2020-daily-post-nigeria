The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiohmole, on Thursday, said he updated President Muhammadu Buhari on the activities of the party and his battles at the courts. Oshiohmole was on Wednesday suspended from office by an FCT High Court presided over by Justice Danlami Senchi. However, a Federal High Court sitting in Kano, presided over by Justice Lewis Allagoa, set aside Wednesday’s interim injunction today. Oshiohmole, told State House correspondents after a closed door meeting with the President, that God would see him through. The former Edo governor described himself as “a child of light who will always defeat darkness”. He said: “I thought that I had a duty to brief Mr President as the overall leader of our party about this development. Incidentally when I requested for the audience yesterday, I wasn’t sure what has happened today will happen. “But I had a duty to inform him about the court order. But happily before coming here, the order from a Federal High Court that has made nonsense of what the FCT court purported to have done has already settled the question. “And I showed to the president the resolutions of my ward even though a ward executive does not have the powers to remove a national chairman, just to say that the document that we have says clearly that my ward passed vote of confidence in me. “How the court can hold a vote of confidence and twist it to mean a vote of no confidence, only that judge can explain it to himself. “But the good news is that this is not a final court nor is it the only court, incidentally it is just the court that didn’t have the jurisdiction even to listen to this matter. And our lawyers so pointed it out but the judge was determined to obliged those who want to destabilise the All Progressive Congress.”

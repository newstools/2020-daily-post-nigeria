Former Ajax midfielder, Abdelhak Nouri has woken up from a coma after two years and nine months. Nouri is currently being treated at home as he seeks to recover from brain damage. This was disclosed by his brother, Abderrahim Nouri, during an interview with Dutch TV show De Wereld Draait Door. DAILY POST recalls that Nouri had a cardiac arrest during Ajax’s pre-season friendly against Werder Bremen in July 2017, leaving him with permanent brain damage. Nouri has not played football since the incident, but Abderrahim is now saying that the 22-year-old can now sit up and watch football matches with the rest of his family. “Abdelhak has not been home for a very long time, we take care of him at home now,” Abderrahim said. “I have to say that since he is at home, he is doing much better than before in the hospital. “He is aware of where he is, and he is back in a familiar environment with his family. “He’s no longer in a coma. He’s just awake. “He sleeps, he sneezes, eats, burps, but it’s not like he gets out of bed. “He’s acutely bedridden and still very dependent on us. “On his good days, there is a form of communication with him like confirmation with his eyebrows or a smile, but you notice that he can not last very long. “We talk to him like he is not sick. We take him into our conversations, and we watch football with him in the living room. “Then, he watches. You notice that he likes that very much. He often shows emotions. Sometimes he is emotional, but often you see him smiling.”

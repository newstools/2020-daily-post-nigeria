The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Yola zonal branch has asked the Federal Government to jettison its IPPIS template for the Universities Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) proposed by ASUU. Prof Augustine Ndaghu, Coordinator of the Yola zone of ASUU which includes universities in Adamawa, Borno, Taraba and Yobe states, said at a press briefing in Yola on Monday that controversies and contradictions following payment of February 2020 salaries through IPPIS are enough for the template to be put aside immediately. He said, “Currently, issues emanating from the payment of February 2020 salary via IPPIS have vindicated ASUU’s position of total rejection of IPPIS which generated lots of controversies and contradictions. “For instance, the payments were replete with underpayments, overpayments, lack of third party deductions and outright omissions, among other cases.” Prof Augustine elaborated, during a question and answer session of the news briefing which took place at the NUJ Press Centre in Yola, that lots of staff were paid salaries that were either ridiculously low or high, with some professors receiving as low as N35,000. “Those who were paid higher than they were due kept quiet, but of course, those paid lower than they should get complained bitterly, even if not to people like us who have remained opposed to IPPIS,” Augustine said. He urged the Federal Government to welcome ASUU’s “innovative alternative to IPPIS,” being UTAS, which he described as “a robust human resources management and compensation system capable of addressing the peculiarities of university staff.”

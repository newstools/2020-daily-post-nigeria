Pastor Tunde Bakare, General Overseer of the Latter Rain Assembly, on Saturday, met with the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai. Bakare hosted El-Rufai to his 60th birthday celebration and presentation of his book in Lagos State. The event also had the Ekiti State Governor, Kayode Fayemi and other top dignitaries in attendance. A post on the verified Twitter handle of Kaduna State Government, reads: “Pastor Tunde Bakare is hosting Malam Nasir @elrufai to a Lagos version of his 60th birthday and presentation of his latest book, These Times.”  This is coming less than 24 hours after El-Rufai had met with the dethroned Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi in his exiled residence in Awe, Nasarawa State. Sanusi, who was dethroned by the Kano State government was banished to Awe area of Nasarawa State where he was kept in confinement.  However, a Federal High Court in Abuja had on Friday ordered his immediate release. Shortly after the ruling, El-Rufai had visited and the duo had departed Awe together.

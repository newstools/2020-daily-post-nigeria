Barcelona captain, Lionel Messi, has said he and his team-mates would be happy to take a 70% pay cut on their salaries, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Messi, in a statement on Monday, also said the players will make an additional contribution, so that none of the non-sporting staff’s earnings will be reduced. Spain has been in a state of emergency since March 12 due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Messi, 32, has a wage in excess of €600,000 per week from Barcelona. The reduction will not only affect the men’s first team, but all of the club’s professional teams, including the basketball side, among others. “We want to clarify that our desire has always been for a reduction to be applied to our salaries because we understand that this is an exceptional situation and we are the first that have ALWAYS helped the club with what they have asked of us. “Many times we have even done things on our own accord, at moments when we felt it necessary or important to do so. “For that reason, it doesn’t cease to surprise us that from inside the club there would be people that want to put us under a magnifying glass or try to pressure us into something that we were always clear we wanted to do. In fact, if the agreement has dragged on, it’s because we were looking for a formula to help the club and its workers in these difficult times. “For our part, the moment has arrived to announce that, aside from the 70% wage cut during the State of Emergency, we are going to also make contributions so that all the club’s employees can earn 100% of their salaries for as long as this situation lasts,” the statement read.

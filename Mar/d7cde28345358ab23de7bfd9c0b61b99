Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom has described a misleading report by a blog that he was among 26 other Nigerian Governors who have refused to go into self-isolation. Governor Samuel Ortom in statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase maintained that he is healthy and doesn’t need self- isolation. According to him, he has neither travelled out of the state in the last one month nor had contact with anyone suspected to have contracted coronavirus. “Ortom became one of the first Governors in the country to set up an action committee on Coronavirus and has released funds to enable the committee take quick steps to prevent the disease from entering the state. “If there was any reason for him to go into self-isolation, he would since have done so. He understands the need to adhere to the directive by medical experts on social distancing among other preventive measures against COVID-19. “In the last few days, Governor Ortom has taken proactive measures against COVID-19 such as establishment of isolation centres in the three zones of the state and intensified awareness on the danger posed by the virus.”

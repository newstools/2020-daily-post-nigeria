Lagos Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has raised alarm over fake news circulating about coronavirus. He spoke on Tuesday at a Stakeholders’ Forum on the Management and Control of COVID-19 (coronavirus). Represented by his Deputy, Obafemi Hamzat, Sanwo-Olu called on community, religious and traditional leaders, associations, educationists and other stakeholders to spread information essential for containment of the virus. “Apart from the threat of coronavirus, an issue of great concern is fake news on social media about the patient currently receiving treatment at a government facility,” he said. Sanwo-Olu advised that information which did not emanate from the Federal Ministry of Health, Lagos State Ministry of Health or the National Centre for Disease Control should be authenticated. He assured that the government was prepared to handle any further incidents of the case. Sanwo-Olu said that owing to the state government’s experience with Ebola in 2014, the government, in partnership with the Canadian Government, set up Biosafety Level-3 Laboratory at the Mainland Hospital Yaba. He said that the laboratory was to enhance the capacity to manage any disease outbreak. The governor appealed to persons with fever, cough or difficulty in breathing, to seek medical attention immediately.

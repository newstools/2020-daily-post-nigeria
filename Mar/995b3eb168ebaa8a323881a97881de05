The chairman of Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria, RTEAN, has advised government at all levels to announce and ensure a near total lockdown in the federation. Chairman of the association in Edo State, Pastor Sunday Erhahor said this when speaking to DAILY POST on Friday in Benin city, the state capital, saying he will support a total lockdown which will be of great help at this critical time when the whole world is battling the deadly COVID-19. According to him, ” I would want the government to order the law enforcement agents to ensure close to a total shutdown in the society. We are doing our best as transporters, everyone, be you a commuter, must adhere strictly to government directive. “The virus is a virus that has ego, the virus does not come to you but you are the one that will go to it and by the time you go close, it comes totally to you and affects your system negativity. Meanwhile, traders and drivers within the city centre have called on the government to save them from the hands of its revenue agents who they alleged had been harassing them by seizing their goods. According to one of the drivers who spoke on the condition of anonymity, government and their agents are making life difficult for Edo people by mounting pressure on revenue generation. They said government should have either reduced or made it a total ticketing free due to the fact that they can’t even afford to feed for now, let alone, paying for tickets that may not yield anything in return.

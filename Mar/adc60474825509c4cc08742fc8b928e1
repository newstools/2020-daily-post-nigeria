Floyd Mayweather has offered to train Deontay Wilder, ahead of his third fight with Tyson, assuring him that he will win. Wilder’s camp on Sunday confirmed that they have activated a rematch clause in his contract, following the defeat against Fury in seven rounds in Las Vegas. Mayweather, who had an incredible unbeaten record of 50-0 during his boxing career, believes he can provide Wilder with ammunition to exact revenge. “If I train him I can teach him how to win,” Mayweather said according to SportsMail. The trilogy fight is provisionally slated for July 18 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas.

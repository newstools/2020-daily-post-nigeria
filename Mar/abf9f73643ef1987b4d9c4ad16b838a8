Watford coach, Nigel Pearson, has said that his side defeated Liverpool 3-0 in the Premier League on Saturday night because his players were at their best. He also singled out Senegalese winger, Ismaila Sarr, for praise following the 22-year-old’s impressive display against the Premier League leaders. Watford defeated Jurgen Klopp’s men at Vicarage Road to end the Reds’ 44-game unbeaten run, thanks to two goals from Ismaila Sarr and a strike from Troy Deeney. Speaking after the match, Pearson was quoted by Watford’s official website as saying: “To beat the best club side in the world at the moment is testament to how we played. “We were at our best today [against Liverpool], and I am proud of my players’ performances. “It is a vital three points, and we have got ten games left, and they’re all going to be very important.” He added: “Sarr is an excellent player and young as well. “His impact against Liverpool was outstanding today. “We need to do everything we can to keep him available.”

The main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has cried out over the Supreme Court decision to reserve judgment in the Zamfara State governorship election review case. Recall that the All Progressives Congress (APC) had returned to the Supreme Court, seeking to overturn the apex court’s earlier judgment that voided the party’s victory in all state elections in the State in 2019 and awarded the same to the PDP. The court at its sitting yesterday, reserved judgment in the case. The Court’s decision triggered apprehension in the main opposition party, leading to an emergency media briefing late yesterday. PDP’s National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan who addressed newsmen on Tuesday alleged “another plot by the APC to once again manipulate the judicial process and secure judgment through the back door. According to him, “Nigerians will recall that the Supreme Court had consistently decided on the finality of judgments reached at the court. “As such, all issues bordering on review were never reserved for judgment because of its belief in the infallibility of its own judgment. “Our party is concerned that the surprising decision to reserve this judgment is not in tandem with the established practice of the highest court, which was reaffirmed in its judgments on the Bayelsa and Imo state governorship elections, where it dismissed the applications for review on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction to review its own judgment.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that Paul Pogba, Marcus Rashford, Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka will miss the Red Devils’ FA Cup fifth-round clash against Derby County on Thursday. Pogba and Rashford remain on the sidelines due to injury after undergoing surgery. At the same time, James picked up a knock in Man United’s Europa League win over Club Brugge, and Wan-Bissaka obtained a back problem. Man United head to the game after playing a 1-1 draw against Everton in the Premier League last weekend. “James will probably miss out against Derby as well, and Marcus and Paul are still out, and I think Aaron might be struggling,” Solskjaer was quoted by Man United’s official website as telling reporters at his pre-match press conference on Wednesday. “He will take a test today, but he struggled in our last game against Everton with his back so that he might be out. “Paul’s still working with the physios outside, and he won’t be training with the first team still next week. “So then let us see how long that will take, but he’ll need some time to train to get his football fitness back.”

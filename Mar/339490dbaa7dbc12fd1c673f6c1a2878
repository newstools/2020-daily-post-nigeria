An activist lawyer, Barr. Paul Ede on Wednesday aligned himself with the position of Justice Chima Nweze on the application filed by former Governor of Imo State, Emeka Ihedioha. Recall that the Supreme Court had dismissed Ihedioha’s application seeking a review of its earlier judgment that sacked him and declared Hope Uzodinma governor of Imo State. In a majority judgment of a seven-man panel of judges led by the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Tanko Muhammad, the apex court had ruled that its verdict was final on the governorship tussle in the state. However, Nweze who is one of the Supreme Court Justices had disagreed with the judgment against Ihedioha, stressing that the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, governorship candidate’s application had merit Speaking with DAILY POST, Edeh commended Justice Nweze for outlining the truth, stressing that only God can make laws that can’t be reversed. According to Edeh: “I totally align myself with the dissenting judgment of Justice Nweze who was bold enough to state what some of us believed the law truly is because any court ruling not predicated on the rule of law and in accordance with laid down principles of justice should not be encouraged. “Justice Nweze if I may quote him verbatim said ‘In my intimate reading of the January 14 judgment, the meat and substance of Ihedioha’s matter were lost to time frame. “This court has set aside its earlier judgment, therefore, it can’t use time frame to extinguish the right of only person. This court has the power to overrule itself and can revisit any decision not in accordance with justice.” “This opinion by Justice Nweze shows that the judgment given on January 14 was not in tandem with the true position of law and because the six wise men thought the Supreme Court won’t be able to visit it’s judgment because it’s sacrosanct which is not the position as its only God that can make an absolute decision that can’t be reversed and not the Supreme Court.”

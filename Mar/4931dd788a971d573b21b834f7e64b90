Femi Fani-Kayode, a former Minister of Aviation, has challenged President Muhammadu Buhari to assure Nigerians that he (Buhari) is not sick by conducting a live broadcast. Fani-Kayode wants President Buhari to prove that the rumour flying about that he and his Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari have been secretly flown abroad for treatment is not true. There is a rumour making the rounds that Buhari and Kyari are no longer in Nigeria but have been flown abroad for treatment of Coronavirus which the Chief of Staff had tested positive for. The former Minister said the rumours are heartbreaking and disheartening, adding that Nigerians deserved to be reassured that they have not been abandoned midstream. “I urge President Buhari to conduct a LIVE TV broadcast to assure the Nigerian people that he is well and that he has not fled our shores to seek medical treatment elsewhere,” Fani-Kayode tweeted. “The rumours are heartbreaking and disheartening. We deserve to be reassured that we have not been abandoned midstream.” The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed on Thursday debunked the rumours that Buhari has also contracted the dreaded virus.

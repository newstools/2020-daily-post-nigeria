The Senior Pastor of the Covenant Nation, Poju Oyemade, has urged churches to respect the government’s call for social distancing. Most states in Nigeria have shut down large gatherings, as the country tries to curb the spread of the coronavirus. Oyemade, in an online service on Sunday, explained that social distancing is a biblical concept. He called on other churches to regulate themselves, in order to be ahead in its dealings with the state. “God designed us to protect the honour of His Church through a principle known as self-judgment. This way we always stay far ahead of the curve when it comes to interaction with the State. “This principle is outlined in 1 Corinthians 11:31-32: ‘For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.’ “This implies that we protect ourselves from external discipline if we have very strong self-governing mechanisms. As our country therefore contends with the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important for us to understand that it has no religious affiliation,” he said. Nigeria on Monday, recorded its first coronavirus-related death.

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hailed David De Gea as the best goalkeeper in the world, despite his howler during their 1-1 draw with Everton on Sunday. De Gea’s clearance cannoned in off Dominic Calvert-Lewin to give the hosts an early lead. Bruno Fernandes drilled in a low shot in the second half, to earn United a share of the points at Goodison Park. De Gea made up for his error with a fine save to deny Gylfi Sigurdsson in the final minutes. However, he now made seven errors leading directly to a goal since the start of last season. “David has shown here his reaction, the way he made amends and saved Sigurdsson’s shot at the end. “David is, for me, the best goalkeeper in the world. He went through a difficult patch last season but he has been very, very good this season. “I can’t remember any goals this season apart from the Watford one. I trust David 100%,” Solskjaer told the media after the match.

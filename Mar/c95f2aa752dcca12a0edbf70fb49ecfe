The secretary to the Anambra State government, Prof Solo Chukwulobelu has said all the samples from the state sent to Irua in Edo State for testing have come out negative. Chukwulobelu said in a press briefing that currently, there is still no case of Covid-19 in the state, and that this was attributable to the state governor, Chief Willie Obiano, who he said had spared nothing to ensure protection of the people of the state. He said, “All our samples have have been negative. In fact, we almost went into panic last week over a case, but when the result came out, it was negative. “The governor has done so much. For now we are focusing on prevention, and we have largely succeeded. We don’t want protection and treatment yet for now.” The joint press briefing also featured the commissioner for health, Dr Vincent Okpala who said the state was making efforts to establish a testing center in Anambra. “By next week, we should be able to start testing people. All these things invole money and we urge people to donate to the state government. “We need ICU equipments, ventilators. Personal protective equipments, PPE. PPE are very expensive, and you can use over 200 of them during the period of treating just one patient. “Prevention, protection and treatment need money. We have an estimate of 7million people, but we have already been able to procure 3million PPE which has already cost N1billion. All the cases we have sent for test have turned out negative.”

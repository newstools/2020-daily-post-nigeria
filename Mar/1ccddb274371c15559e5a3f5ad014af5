Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, expects to have Marcus Rashford available for the last few games of the season. There were fears Rashford would not play again until next season, after suffering a back injury against Wolves in January. However, latest scan results have offered good news. The 22-year-old could feature in the final three rounds of the Premier League and potential FA Cup and Europa League finals. “The scan came back quite positive. We cant rush it and it’ll probably be another couple of months before we see him but when he’s fit, he will be stronger for it. “He’s around the place, in the dressing-room before games, at half-time. He wants the boys to do well so he can come back and play in the Europa League, the FA Cup Final. He wants to be there when the business end comes,” Solskjaer told reporters ahead of the Everton clash.

Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has called for Premier League fixtures to be cancelled. According to the Spaniard, it is better to suspend games than play behind closed doors, as coronavirus continues to affect sporting events. So far in the UK, the government has allowed football matches to continue as normal. But on Tuesday, the Premier League decided to move City’s clash with Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday over fears of the spreading coronavirus. Authorities in Italy have postponed Serie A games, while league matches in Spain will be played without fans for two weeks. “I would not love to play matches in the Premier League or Champions League or the cups without the people. But we are going to follow the instructions of the government. “Everybody around the world is involved in that and we just follow what we have to do and follow the instructions,” Guardiola said according to ESPN.

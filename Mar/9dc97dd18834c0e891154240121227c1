The bill, which was sponsored by the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege said, “pre-election disputes emanating from Congresses, Conferences, Conventions or other meetings” should no longer be the business of the State High Courts. Moreso, the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory which has coordinate jurisdiction with State High Courts was also affected in the bill. Both bills to alter the affected provisions in the Constitution passed second reading on the floor of the Senate. There were referred to the Ad-hoc Senate Committee on Constitutional Review for a detailed consideration at the public hearings. Senate President, Dr Ahmad Ibrahim Lawan urged the Committee to expedite action, saying that there was a need to tidy the judicial system in the handling of election issues.

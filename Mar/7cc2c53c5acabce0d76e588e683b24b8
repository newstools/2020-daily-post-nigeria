Arimogija community in Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State has been thrown into mourning following the killing of a farmer earlier declared missing in the community. The farmer, Vincent Ejeh, who had been missing for almost a month was discovered buried in a shallow grave on another farmer’s farm in the community. Recall that DAILY POST had reported how the farmer who left for his farm on February 13, 2020, never returned home. Speaking on the development, Mr. Abu Ejeh, a brother of the deceased said that the corpse of Mr. Vincent Abu was discovered in a shallow grave by some farmers who were working on a farm. While emphasizing that the family demands justice for the gruesome murder of his brother who is the breadwinner of the family, Mr. Abu called on security agencies to ensure that the perpetrators of the dastardly act are nabbed and brought to book. He added that his brother was an easy-going man whose death remains a mystery as to why anyone would kill him in such a manner. “We are still confused over what had happened. Our hope was that we would find him since the search for his whereabouts began but with this, we are in a fixed. “His body was found by some youths who were clearing a farm. They saw a grave which made them raised the alarm before the grave was dug and his corpse was found. “We want the police to get to the root of this matter because my brother was the breadwinner of the family. He had eight children who are all still very young. “We don’t even know how the wife will cope. Those who did this to us are nothing but wicked souls because he had no issues with anyone. So, we don’t understand why anyone will just take his life in that cruel manner.

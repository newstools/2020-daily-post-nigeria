National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Tinubu, on Saturday described Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as a dependable ally of President Muhammadu Buhari. Tinubu made the remark while felicitating with Osinbajo on his 63 rd birthday. Osinbajo, who was a former Attorney General of Lagos State during the tenure of Tinubu as governor, turns 63 on Sunday. However, Tinubu commended Osinbajo for his loyalty, dedication and selflessness. In a congratulatory statement sent to DAILY POST by his Media Office, the APC National Leader said: “I congratulate Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on turning 63. “Erudite legal luminary, Osinbajo’s reputation for loyalty, dedication, selflessness is well deserved. He is resolutely committed to the causes he believes in. “Osinbajo has proven to be a dependable ally of President Muhammadu Buhari, working harmoniously with the president to deliver for the country. “I recall with fond memories of the time we worked together along with other technocrats to help lay a solid foundation for an egalitarian and prosperous Lagos.” Tinubu recalled how Osinbajo teamed up with him and they restructured Lagos State during his tenure as governor. He stated that most of the cases Lagos State won at the Supreme Court had the “imprint” of Osinbajo. “We used the instrumentality of the law to advance the course of restructuring and get for Lagos what rightly belongs to her. “Most of the landmark cases Lagos won at the Supreme Court bore Osinbajo’s imprint. “I wish his wife, Dolapo Osinbajo, and other members of the family a most memorable celebration. “My prayer is for God Almighty to grant Osinbajo continued good health, renewed vitality and many more years of service to the country,” he added.

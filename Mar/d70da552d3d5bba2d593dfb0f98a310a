Arsenal midfielder, Lucas Torreira, has said manager Mikel Arteta is “better” and has been communicating with the players. Arteta was forced into self-isolation after he was infected with the coronavirus. The Gunners also shut down their London Colney training ground, even as the Premier League decided to suspend fixtures until at least April 4. Torreira is currently out of action, after suffering an ankle injury which is set to keep him sidelined until late May. The Uruguay international has now revealed Arteta is keeping in touch with the rest of the squad. “The truth is that we didn’t expect this virus to reach the club, the locker room. Mikel Arteta is better. He was able to communicate with us and he is improving,” he told Sport 890. “In recent days, many cases of coronavirus were discovered in London and people were nervous. In some supermarkets, you can no longer find toilet paper or gel alcohol,” he added.

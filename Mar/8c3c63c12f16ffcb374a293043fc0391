Academic Staff Union of Universities, (ASUU) Yobe State University Branch has joined the two-week warning strike called by the national body of the union. The notification of the strike action was contained in a letter dated 12th March, 2020 and signed by the Branch’s chairperson, Mohammed Saje Jajere. Part of the strike notification read: “Sequel to the National Executive Council, (NEC) meeting of ASUU held on 7th-8th March, 2020, the NEC has resolved and directed its members to embark on two weeks warning strike with effect from Monday, 9th March, 2020. “In view of the said directives, the university management is hereby formally notified that the congress of ASUU-YSU Branch resolve to join strike from 12th March, 2020”. A visit to the university by DAILY POST Correspondent showed that, academic activities have been paralysed following the warning strike. It was learnt that most students of the university have already vacated hostels and have traveled out to their various communities, pending the expiration of the warning strike. However, an observation also showed that, few undergraduates particularly final year students have decided to stay back and deal with their projects and other assignments. Recalled that the national body of ASUU had directed its members to embark on a 2-week warning strike in protest against federal government planned move to enroll university teachers into the Integrated Personal Payroll Information System, (IPPIS) for the payment of their salaries. ASUU, among other reasons, is viewing the move as a deliberate attempt to infringe on the financial autonomy of the Nigerian universities.

NUJ made this declaration via a statement jointly signed its Chairman, Mr Ademola Babalola and Secretary, Mr Sola Oladapo. DAILY POST gathered that the state Governor, Mr. Seyi Makinde had imposed a curfew in the state (7pm-6am) as parts of measures to curtail the spread of Coronavirus also known as Covid-19. The curfew took effect from Sunday evening. It was, however, gathered that some overzealous security agents Sunday evening harassed some journalists in the course of performing their duties. NUJ while reacting, said that journalists were major stakeholders in the efforts to curtail the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19). The union called on heads of security agencies in the state to caution their officers from harassing journalists in the discharge of their duties during the period of the curfew. It also called on media organisations to provide kits and sanitisers to their crews and ensure only experienced reporters are made to handle critical report at the period. The NUJ urged members to maintain social distancing at their live interview programmes, while handwashing basins and sanitisers be provided at every important corridor. The union also called on media managers to allow colleagues work from home except where it was absolutely necessary to come to office or studio.

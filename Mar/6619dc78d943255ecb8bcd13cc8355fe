Despite the ban on all social activities, including weddings, traditional marriages, burials, clubbing and others, some communities in Anambra state still hold such gatherings. DAILY POST gathered that the flaunting of the order in the communities has angered Governor Willie Obiano who has vowed to deal with the leaders of the community if they failed to cause their subjects to heed his order. A memo which was sent to all the president-general of the communities in Anambra, which was obtained by DAILY POST’s reporter showed that the governor expressed dismay on the actions of the people in the affected communities. The Memo was signed on behalf of Commissioner, Ministry of Local Govt Chieftaincy and Affairs, by Greg Obi by Henry Nwasike, the PRO of the ministry. It reads, “Dear President-General, please, I am directed to inform you that His Excellency, Gov Willie Obiano has expressed dismay that most communities, despite continuous awareness, are not carrying out the State Govt’s directive on measures put in place to prevent the COVID-19 in our dear state. “The Governor noted that people in most Communities still engage in social events, funerals, weddings etc and other gatherings numbering above thirty persons. To this end, the state Govt will hold the President-General accountable in any community where this directive is abused, and appropriate sanctions may be applied where applicable. Let’s help ourselves to stay alive and safe.”

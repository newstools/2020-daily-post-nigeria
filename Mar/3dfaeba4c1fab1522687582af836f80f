Zimbabwe’s defence minister Oppah Muchinguri has described the coronavirus pandemic as a “punishment” to the US and Europe. Muchinguri said this while speaking at a rally in the northern town of Chinhoyi on Saturday. According to her, it’s a punishment to Europe for imposing sanctions against members of the ruling regime over human rights abuses. She said/ “Coronavirus is the work of God punishing countries who imposed sanctions on us. “They are now staying indoors. Their economies are screaming just like they did to our economy.” Muchinguri added that COVID-19 would teach US President Donald Trump that “he is not God”. “They must feel the effects of coronavirus and understand our pain,” she added. The United States and the European Union had imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe’s Hugh ranking officials during the despotic rule of the country’s late ex-president Robert Mugabe Since its outbreak in Wuhan, Coronavirus has killed almost 6,000 people worldwide and caused cancellations of sports events.

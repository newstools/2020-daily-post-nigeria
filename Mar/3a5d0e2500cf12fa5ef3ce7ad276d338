Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has urged Barcelona midfielder, Philippe Coutinho, to make a transfer move to join Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham Hotspur this summer. According to Ferdinand, Coutinho, who is currently on loan at Bayern Munich would hundred percent improve Mourinho’s side. Coutinho, a former Liverpool player, left Jurgen Klopp’s side in 2018 to join Barcelona in a £130million deal. The Brazilian could be available this summer transfer window, but Ferdinand believes Tottenham should explore to bring the 27-year-old to Spurs. “At Liverpool Coutinho was an amazing player, but since he left the club, he hasn’t really done it yet,” Ferdinand said in an Instagram Q&A on Monday as quoted by Manchester Evening News. “He struggled at Barcelona, struggled to fit in there, and then he hasn’t done amazingly well at Bayern. “Coming into the Premier League to the right team would be a saviour for him, he needs that. “I would have said Man United before Bruno Fernandes turned up, but not now. Would he improve Spurs? Yes, he would, 100 percent but not Man United, though.” DAILY POST recalls that Coutinho had drawn interest from Liverpool, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain in the past.

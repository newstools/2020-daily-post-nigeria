The Governor of Imo State, Senator Hope Uzodinma has advised his Rivers state counterpart, Nyesom Wike to be mindful of utterances capable of fanning the embers of disunity both in his own party, PDP and the nation at large. Governor Uzodinma was reacting to the position of the Rivers State Governor on the crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress, APC, wherein he chided Uzodinma. In a press release signed by the Chief Press Secretary to Imo state Governor and made available to newsmen, Governor Uzodinma accused Wike of arrogating power to himself, adding that he has no regret in his comment that the PDP and characters like Wike were instrumental to the attempted plot to remove the National chairman of APC, Adams Oshiomhole. “It is unfortunate that Governor Wike pretends to have a court injunction on how to speak carelessly, the reason many erstwhile members of the PDP including founding members, had abandoned the party which is about to collapse on Wike’s head. “Rather than engage in introspection on what went wrong with his party, the Governor thinks that trivializing serious issues of national and international importance will bring accolades to his way. “If Governor Nyesom Wike did not have a hand in Oshiomhole’s attempted removal, why the insults on Senator Uzodinma whose only crime was that he brought Wike’s mischievous tendencies to the fore for everyone to see,” he said. The release further warned the Rivers state Governor to steer clear of Imo government and Governor who is at the moment occupied with issues of how to move his state (Imo) forward. Similarly, it advised the Governor to have respect for the rule of law and stop denigrating the Supreme Court that adjudicated over Uzodinma’s case by carelessly describing it as synonymous with fraud. Meanwhile, the Imo Governor has reiterated his commitment to deliver on his 3Rs of Reconstruction, Rehabilitation and Recovery, promising that utterances such as Wike’s won’t make him lose concentration.

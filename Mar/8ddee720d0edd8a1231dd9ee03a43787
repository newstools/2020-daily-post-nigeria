Senator Peter Nwaoboshi has warned Senators on the dangers of balkanising the nation in the guise of making laws that is favourable to their zones. His position was at the backdrop of a bill sponsored by Senator Ibikunle Amosun representing Ogun Central Senatorial district, asking for the creation of South West Development Commission (SWDC). The need for creation of South West Development Commission, Amosun argued, was for the development of the South West, adding that the zone has sacrificed immensely for the country in terms of economic derivatives. As other Senators looks towards the importance of the bill, Peter Nwaoboshi, however, dissented, saying that creation of geopolitical Commissions would divide the country. He reminded the red Chambers how the President declined assent to the South East Development Commission which was passed into law in the eight Senate. “Mr. President, distinguished colleagues, let us not sit down in this Chambers to balkanise the country. “The idea of creating Commissions for zones would divide the country. Remember how President Buhari in his wisdom refused to sign South East Development Commission bill and for me, I will not support this bill. ” The bill passed second reading preparatory for the public hearings.

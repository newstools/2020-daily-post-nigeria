The camp of Emeka Ihedioha, Wednesday night, condemned the Imo State Government’s accusation that the former governor was planning a massive protest in Imo. It stated that there was no plan for a protest on Thursday, even though the natural demonstrations by aggrieved Imolites, who still believe that Ihedioha was robbed of his victory, will continue A statement by AIC Akwarandu, a spokesman to the ex-governor, said: “Ihedioha the man Imolites voted for and declared winner on this day last year, 11th of March, 2019, will be arriving Imo State tomorrow Thursday, 12th March, 2020, after the Supreme Court Injustice.” Akwarandu, former Special Assistant on New Media to Ihedioha, observed that “There is a spontaneous and unforced desire by the majority of Ndi Imo that Ihedioha, the Democratic Hero of our day, must be received accordingly, as a matter of appreciation for his giant strides within the period of 7 months he held sway. “The Press Statement by the illegal government is unnecessary and uncalled for. It is simply an attempt to beg for attention and be noticed. “It is on record that since January 14th, even in the face of every provocation, Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha has remained calm, and has continued to urge his supporters and the entirety of Ndi Imo remain peaceful and law-abiding.” The statement warned that any attempt to infiltrate the peaceful reception organized by Ndi Imo with thugs shall be totally and comprehensively resisted. “Imo State belongs to all of us and we must live to respect the rights of those who may oppose us, same way we respect the rights of those who support us”, Akwarandu added.

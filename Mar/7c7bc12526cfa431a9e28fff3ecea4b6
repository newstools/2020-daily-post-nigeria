UEFA say European leagues have committed to ending all domestic seasons by June 30. All the major leagues in Europe including the Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1 are on hold until April. It is however hoped the coronavirus pandemic will relent and allow fixtures to resume, as authorities will prefer to complete the season. Should that be the case, it would see leagues round up exactly one month after the original end date of May 30. A UEFA statement says there may be “possible limitations or drops of current exclusive calendar slots, potentially resulting in the scheduling of domestic league matches in mid-week and scheduling of UEFA club competitions matches on weekends”.

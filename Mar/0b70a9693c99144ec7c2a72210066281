Former England striker, Wayne Rooney, has said football in England would be on hold until it is safe for both players and supporters. The FA decided to suspend fixtures on Friday, after Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta and Chelsea winger Calum Hudson-Odoi, tested positive to coronavirus. April 3 has been fixed as a tentative date for resumption of football. But Rooney, writing in his The Times column, made it clear they were ready to play until September if need be. “Thankfully football made the right call in the end. We had to put the season on hold. Some people won’t be happy but I just think, in this case, football has to come second. It’s a sport. It’s just a sport. “We’re happy to play until September if the season extends to then, if that’s how it has to be. That’s our job. As long as we know we’re safe to play and it’s a safe environment for spectators, we’ll play,” the Derby County star said.

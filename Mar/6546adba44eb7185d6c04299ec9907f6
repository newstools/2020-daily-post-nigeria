Manchester United players will return to training on April 10, the UK Mirror reports. Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sent his squad home last week, with individual fitness programmes for each player. Their AON training centre at Carrington was then closed due to the spread of the Coronavirus. Solskjaer has met with coaches Michael Carrick, Mike Phelan and Kieran McKenna, to work through plans for the coming weeks. They all reached a decision to give the players another three weeks in effective self-isolation, managing their own fitness and training before bringing them back to Carrington on April 10. United’s fitness team believe that would give them the required time to prepare players for the resumption of the Premier League in early May. “It’s being reviewed weekly but April 10 is the plan for now,” a spokesperson confirmed.

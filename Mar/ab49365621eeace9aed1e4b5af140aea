Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki has gone into self-isolation after he made close contact with the Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Muhammed and the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, who have both tested positive for Coronavirus. Bauchi governor tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday after having contact with Atiku Abubakar’s son. Obaseki in a statement sent to DAILY POST by his Special Adviser to the Governor on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, said he has sent his samples for testing. He, however, said he has not shown any symptoms of COVID-19 but is presently taking necessary precautions to protect his family and aides. The statement read in part: “The governor has gone into self-isolation after the Governor of Bauchi State, Senator Bala Mohammed and Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari, tested positive for coronavirus. “The governor had met Senator Mohammed at the Nigeria Governors Forum (NGF) and National Economic Council (NEC) meetings. He also visited Mr. Kyari.” Kyari’s status may have put the lives of some governors and ministers at risk as he was seen at Kogi State with many of them after he returned from Germany. Kyari was among the presidential delegates sent by Buhari to commiserate with Yahaya Bello over his mother’s death. Others present were; Minister of Special Duties, Senator George Akume, Minister of Information, Culture and Tourism, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the Minister of State, FCT Dr. Ramatu Tijjani, the Minister of State and Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubair Dada

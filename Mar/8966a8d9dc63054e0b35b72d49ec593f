Jamie Carragher has claimed that senior Liverpool players expressed their concern over the club bringing in Jose Mourinho before Rafa Benitez was appointed. Mourinho was still manager of FC Porto at the time and went on to manage Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur in England Having just clinched the Champions League with Porto, Liverpool were considering Mourinho to replace Gerard Houllier. However, the players at Anfield at the time, felt the Portuguese would not fit the ‘Liverpool way’. “Gerard Houllier had lost his job and Rick Parry had interviewed Rafa Benitez at some stage. He was just keeping the senior players informed of where they were up to. “But I think the feeling was that Jose Mourinho couldn’t be a Liverpool manager. Possibly, in some ways, because of the way he conducted himself at times,” Carragher told Sky Sports.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic has decided to leave AC Milan, less than three months after re-signing for the club, Sport Mediaset reports. Ibrahimovic will leave as a free agent at the end of June, as he is unhappy with the recent sacking of chief football officer Zvonimir Boban. Boban was instrumental in bringing the Swedish striker back to Milan, where he first played between 2010 and 2012. The departure of Boban has convinced Ibrahimovic to leave at the end of this season rather than 2021. It is believed that Ibrahimovic has made up his mind and will inform Milan CEO, Ivan Gazidis. The 38-year-old has netted four times in 10 appearances since his return to the Serie A club. He is now considering a career in management.

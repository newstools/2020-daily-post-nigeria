The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has warned Bola Tinubu, National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, APC, against attempts to hide under social palliatives for Coronavirus impact to covertly sell the agenda of APC leaders and the cabal. PDP claimed that Tinubu’s sudden interest in palliative measure could be seen as an attempt to prey on Nigeria’s economy at such a critical time. The former ruling party stated this in a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan. According to PDP: “We alert that Senator Tinubu’s sudden and unsolicited interest in palliative funds, without proffering instruments that will guarantee direct disbursement to the poor masses and check diversions, raises serious issues of ostensible attempt to prey on our national economy at this critical time. “It indeed speaks volumes that while the PDP and other patriotic Nigerians and organizations have been rallying for solution, the APC has not made any meaningful suggestion for a solution. “Rather, its leaders are busy seeking to use the unfortunate situation to further plunder our national economy.” PDP urged the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, to “hedge its system from APC leaders and immediately develop strategies that will enable it to directly reach the poor masses in the informal sector for disbursement of fiscal palliative to cushion the effect of COVID-19.” The party added: “The CBN should explore ways of routing the intervention to the people using their Bank Verification Number (BVN) data in various banks in addition to other social welfare programmes that would directly reach the unemployed and the elderly.”

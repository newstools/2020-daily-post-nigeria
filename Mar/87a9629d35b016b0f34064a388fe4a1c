A medical expert, Dr Olufemi Ogunyemi, has warned the Nigerian government to immediately lockdown Nigeria to stop the spread of coronavirus. This was contained in a statement he sent to DAILY POST Monday night. The Anesthesiology doctor said Nigeria must act fast to ensure the global pandemic does not affect too many citizens. Ogunyemi advised the government to enforce stay-at-home order, adding that such was mandatory at this time. He stated that Nigeria must urgently get Personal Protective Equipment and that everyone taking care of Covid-19 patients is going to need one. “Get them now in thousands”, Ogunyemi added. “Get ventilators now. Death from COVID-19 usually results from respiratory failure and/or underlying medical disease. “Once the lungs fail to deliver oxygen to the muscles and vital organs, they start to fail. Organ failure is precisely what ICU is designed for. Nigeria does not manufacture ventilators so we must buy, beg and borrow,” he said. He also called for better training of health personnel, including doctors, nurses, technicians, porters and others in the healthcare setting. The expert added that “Social distancing is NOT lockdown; Shutting the airspace is NOT a lockdown. This is the time for a mandatory and enforced lockdown. “This is hard to do in a free society with individual rights and freedom of movement. It was easier for China but has been difficult for Italy. A delay in placing a lockdown makes it less effective. “Essential services can still be provided in a lockdown scenario. This is what Government is for. A lockdown in Nigeria now will significantly limit the spread of Covid-19. It must be mandatory and enforced.” On Monday, Nigeria shut all land borders. Flights have also been restricted to Lagos and Abuja.

Former Venezuelan and Major League Soccer hero, Alejandro Moreno, has urged Liverpool to let four of their key players, including Mohamed Salah leave Anfield this summer. Moreno believes Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp should have a refresh of his squad at the end of the season by allowing Salah, Adam Lallana, Adrian, and Dejan Lovren leave the Champions League holders. Speaking on the players he wants to leave Liverpool this summer, Moreno told ESPN FC: “Yes, Adrian is gone. “I need to tell you something, and there are going to be some Reds fans waiting outside his house and packing the boxes for him, ‘Alright Adrian, go.’ “I feel the time for Dejan Lovren at Liverpool is over because the defender offers you something but not quite good enough. “I also feel Liverpool should go for a better player that can give a better quality of the job that Lallana was doing. “Mohamed Salah. This is a tricky one because a lot of Liverpool’s hearts will say, ‘Oh, we’ve got to keep Salah.’ “I am going to say you can do better than the Egyptian star. “I admire the number of goals he has scored for Liverpool, he has been great for the club but and I think there are a lot of opportunities that he misses and Liverpool can go for a better version of Mohamed Salah.” Liverpool is currently on top of the Premier League table with 25 points ahead of second-position Manchester City. The Premier League had postponed the English top-flight competition until April 30 due to the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) across Europe.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Monday arraigned one Idongesit Eyibo before the Federal High Court, Uyo division, for allegedly providing misleading information. Eyibo participated in the 2013 lottery competition organised by the Papi Events and Promotion Limited in conjunction with the Akwa Ibom State government as part of activities to commemorate the Silver Jubilee Celebration of the state. The participant who allegedly won about eight houses at the competition  was said to have given false information to the Commission punishable under section 39(2)(b) of the Commission’s Act,2004. The charge with registration number FHC/Uyo/109c/2019 was signed on behalf of the Commission by Barrister Adebayo Soares, Esq. The charge reads “That you Idongesit Eyibo ‘M’ on or about the 24th day of July, 2019 at Uyo within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, did make a statement to officers of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission via a written petition addressed to the office of the said Commission which to your knowledge was intended to mislead the officers of the Commission in investigating the petition and thereby committed an offence contrary to section 39(2)(a) of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission Establishment Act 2004 and punishable under section 39(2)(b) of the same act” It was gathered that the accused allegedly authored a petition to the EFCC against Papi Events and Promotion Limited on conduct bordering on fraud. But upon preliminary investigation, the Commission perceived the transaction to be a purely civil and commercial transactions rather than criminal and worthy of investigation. It was gathered that Eyibo proceeded to the Human Rights Radio,(Brekete) in Abuja and allegedly accused the EFCC of dereliction of duty and bias, prompting the Commission to commence full-scale investigation into the matter. He has been arraigned before the court and the case adjourned till March 26, 2020 for commencement of hearing.

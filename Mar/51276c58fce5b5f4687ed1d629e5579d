Former senator representing Abia North, Senator Mao Ohuabunwa, has been accused of pushing for the declaration of the seat of jailed Senate Majority Whip’s seat, Senator Orhi Uzor Kalu, vacant. A release by Amara Umunna, the media officer of Chief David Onuoha-Bourdex and made available to DAILY POST, stated that Ohuabunwa was working to get the Senate President, Ahmed Lawan to declare Kalu’s seat vacant. The release said, “In his desperate quest for another opportunity to return to the Red Chamber, Ohuabunwa and his hired hands have resorted to verbal attacks on the billionaire businessman and member of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Chief (Dr.) Onuoha-Bourdex, whom he accused of lacking political discipline. “While we urge the good people of Abia North and the Senate President, Dr. Ahmed Lawan, to ignore the distractions, we are constrained to ask the failed senator to first of all discharge the burden of explaining to the good people of Abia North Senatorial District what he achieved for them in the past 12 years of his sojourn in the National Assembly. “Perhaps the clamour for a new opening in the Senate is his own way of demonstrating political discipline, but the people of Abia North know that the blind desperation to return to the Senate is a scheme to prepare for his wild dream of contesting the Abia State governorship in 2023.” “Fortunately, the recent escapade of rousing a faceless Abia North-based agricultural multipurpose cooperative society to hand out a 21-day ultimatum to the leadership of the 9th Senate to declare the senate seat occupied by Senator Orji Uzor Kalu vacant or face mass action exposed the folly of his pursuit.”

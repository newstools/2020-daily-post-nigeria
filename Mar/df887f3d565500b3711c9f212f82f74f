Following moves to enforce Governor Abdullahi Gandujeâ€™s total ban on street begging, the Kano Sharia Police, the Hisbah, has arrested and evacuated 68 Almajiris on Thursday from Kano major roads. The Commander General of Hisbah Board, Shiek Muhammad Harun Ibn Sina, said they succeeded in arresting the boys while raiding Sabon Gari town at about 3 am on Thursday. Ibn Sina said surprisingly, out of the 68 adolescent they arrested at Sabon Gari, only three were confirmed to be truly Almajiris begging at the area. He said already they have concluded plans to send all the 68 boys they arrested to the new Tory homes built by Governor Ganduje to teach them some educational basics of both western and Islamic education.

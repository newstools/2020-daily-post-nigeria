Real Madrid manager, Zinedine Zidane, has refused to guarantee he will be at the club next season. Zidane however denied he has been contacted by Juventus and a possible reunion with Cristiano Ronaldo was on the cards. The 47-year-old spent five years with Juve as a player, before moving to Real in 2001. He has now been linked with the Serie A champions, as they consider replacing Maurizio Sarri. “No, no … no one has contacted me and I don’t know anything,” Zidane said ahead of Real Madrid’s match at Real Betis in La Liga on Sunday. “You know what it’s like, people say a lot of things.” However, the Frenchman was less confident when asked if he’ll be in charge at the Bernabeu next season. “It’s not like that. Knowing what comes next doesn’t exist. “I feel supported by the club, yes, that’s clear. The people that work here, we’re all pulling in the same direction. But after all that, I know how this works. I’m coach of Real Madrid today but tomorrow that could change,” Zidane added.

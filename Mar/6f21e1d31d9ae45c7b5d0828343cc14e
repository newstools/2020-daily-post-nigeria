A human rights group, International Society for Civil Liberties and the Rule of Law, Intersociety has said that no fewer than 350 Christians have been killed in Nigeria between January and February of 2020. Intersociety in a report signed by its board of trustees chairman, Mr Emeka Umeagbalasi and made available to to newsmen in Awka said, “Nigeria has fully become a killing field of defenseless Christians. “Available statistics have shown that no fewer than 11,500-12,000 Christian deaths were recorded in the past 57 months or since June 2015 when the present central Government of Nigeria came on board. Out of this figure, Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen accounted for 7,400 Christian deaths, Boko Haram 4000 and the ‘Highway Bandits’ 150-200.
“Also, in the past two months of January and February 2020, no fewer than 350 Christian deaths have been recorded and between 100 and 150 Christian travelers abducted on highways. “And out of the 350 Christian deaths, Jihadist Fulani Herdsmen accounted for no fewer than 250. Boko Haram and ‘Highway Bandits’ are responsible for the remaining 100 deaths. The Killings targeted at Christians in Nigeria have continued into the first week of March 2020 leading to hacking to death of over a dozen more.” The group said it had monitored and documented killing of Christians in Nigeria since 2010 and spoken out against it using several dependable mainstream and online media platforms of local and international credibility. “We usually rely on credible local and foreign media reports, eyewitnesses’ accounts and reports from Christian bodies and church media. Also relied upon are reports from local and international rights and research organizations and credible Government accounts (if any).” It called on government to decide proactive measures to tame the incessant killings.

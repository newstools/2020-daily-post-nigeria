Liverpool has been handed an important double injury boost ahead of their FA Cup fifth-round clash with Chelsea on Tuesday night. The Premier League leaders confirmed this in a post on their official website that defender, Joe Gomez, and midfielder James Milner, have returned to Liverpool’s first-team training at Melwood after recovering from injuries. Gomez and Milner are now in contention to feature for the Reds against Frank Lampard’s men at Stamford Bridge. Speaking at his pre-match press conference on Monday, Liverpool manager, Jurgen Klopp, said: “No news on new injuries, I think Joe and Millie are back. “The others, Jordan Henderson (hamstring) and Xherdan Shaqiri (calf), aren’t.” The match kick-off time is at 8:45 pm.

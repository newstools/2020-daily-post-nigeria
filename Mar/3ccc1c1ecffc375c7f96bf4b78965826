President of the United Nations General Assembly, Amb. Tijani Muhammad-Bande, has warned against the politicisation of the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) emergency. Against the backdrop of the rapid spread of the virus around the world, Muhammad-Bande in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in New York on Monday evening said all countries and government agencies are on their toes to curb the spread of the disease. He warned that the issue on ground is not an issue of politics but a technical issue which should be handled by WHO and health professionals, hence no need to blame the government. “Coronavirus is not an issue of politics, but a technical issue concerning health matters, and let those who are trained on public health guide us about it. “The spread is a serious global challenge and every country is doing its very best because no country jokes about public health of this magnitude. “The most affected country is China, and the Chinese effort is commendable. Everybody has seen what measure they have undertaken. “Nobody should make a pronouncement about what is unfolding other than to say we should listen to the advice of the WHO (World Health Organisation). “There is great coordination between the WHO as a body and national governments or health institutions in tackling the challenge.’’ The spread of COVID-19 threat has become a subject of political blame game in some of the 60 countries affected. In Nigeria, the People Democratic Party, PDP after the announcement of its first case of Coronavirus told Nigerians to hold President Muhammadu Buhari responsible over failure to keep the virus at bay. Meanwhile, Italy is said to be one of the countries worst affected outside China. So far, five African countries namely Algeria, Egypt, Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisia have confirmed cases of the disease.

A member of Redeem Christian Church of God whose name is yet to be known has been shot dead at Works Layout Owerri, the Imo state capital. The incident took place last Sunday while he was driving to church. DAILY POST gathered that the victim allegedly resisted an attempt by the gunman who entered his vehicle at Imo State University junction to kidnap him. He was, until his death a worker at the church’s Provincial Headquarters (Jesus Assembly). Reports further said he had dragged the steering of his vehicle with the bandit who earlier threatened to shoot him. The vehicle skidded off the road and fell into a ditch but the victim made his way out of the vehicle when the gunman quickly came out of the car and shot him dead.

They are not home. “I just ask that we take precautions to the best of our ability to avoid getting caught and even if we are caught with them it is not a problem at all, the virus goes away on its own after only a couple of days. “We are one of the countries that have been plagued by some of the biggest diseases in our growth, these ‘flu’ and not something to scare us. May we have peace in our hearts.” The pandemic in the past few days has hit Africa harder as a total number of 633 confirmed cases has been recorded so far across the continent.

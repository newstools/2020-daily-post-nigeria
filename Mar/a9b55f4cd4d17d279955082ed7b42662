The European football governing body, UEFA, has announced the postponement of the Champions League, Europa League and women’s Champions League finals. The finals of the two major clubs competitions were originally scheduled for May but has been postponed due to the Coronavirus pandemic. “No decision has been taken on rearranged dates,” said UEFA in a statement. “All three competitions are currently suspended along with almost every European domestic league because of the coronavirus,” it added. Recall that the football body had last week postponed the Euro 2020 tournament until next year.

Madeira’s regional health secretary, Pedro Ramos, has confirmed that Cristiano Ronaldo has not contracted coronavirus, SportingLife reports. The Juventus forward is being held in quarantine in his native Madeira. Ronaldo will remain at home, while the fear of infection is still high, with Italy on lockdown. His team-mate, Daniele Rugani, became the first Serie A player to contract the illness, with Paulo Dybala also reported to have tested positive. Ronaldo had flown home to visit his mother Dolores, who suffered a stroke earlier this month. There were reports that Ronaldo has been infected, but Ramos said: “Both the athlete and his family are asymptomatic.” All Serie A matches have been suspended until at least April 3.

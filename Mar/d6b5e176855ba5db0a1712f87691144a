Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has announced that the lockdown of the state would now commence on Friday, April 3. This is against the March 30 earlier announced by President Muhammadu Buhari. DAILY POST reports that Buhari, during a live broadcast on Sunday, announced total lockdown of Ogun, Lagos States and Abuja, to contain the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. But at a press conference he addressed today while inaugurating the Isolation Centre in Ikenne, Gov Abiodun said the lockdown will now take effect from Friday. The Ogun governor said he had spoken with the President, asking him to give residents of the state time to prepare for the lockdown. Abiodun said he told Buhari that the extension became important to allow people buy enough food stuffs and other essential needs for the 14 days lockdown. He said, “Mr President has graciously granted our request.”

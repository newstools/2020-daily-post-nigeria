The Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has refuted claims that results of its 2020 UTME taken on Saturday, March 14 and Monday, March 16 had been cancelled. Recall that the board on Monday, released results of 312,000 candidates who sat for the exam on Saturday. However, candidates who were not able to check yesterday and those who wrote yesterday, have been unable to access their results. Reacting to viral reports on result cancellation, Head, Media and Information, Dr Fabian Benjamin, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Wednesday said such rumours were the handiwork of fraudsters and should be disregarded. He described the rumour as wicked, malicious and misleading. ”JAMB wishes to reassure all candidates who have written this year’s Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) so far that it has not cancelled any of its examination or results. ”All results that have been released so far are intact and therefore there is no need for any panic whatsoever,”he added.

Governor Ahmadu Fintiri of Adamawa State has told his people to be careful and observe all anti-coronavirus instructions even as there is no case in the state yet. He urged the people similarly to keep indoors as much as possible even as there is no curfew anywhere in the state. Fintiri spoke on Saturday against a rumour which gained prominence that the government had imposed a curfew across the state to curb the spread of COVID-19. The governor described the rumour, which went viral on social media platforms, as baseless, and asked the people to disregard it. Fintiri, who spoke through his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Humwashi Wonosikou, advised the people to expect authentic information only from genuine government sources. A statement issued by Wonosikou reiterated nonetheless that with or without COVID-19 case in the state, and with or without curfew, the people must discipline themselves to carry out instructions issued to keep the coronavirus away. “Please, despite not having the pandemic in the state, people should observe social distancing and basic hygiene of hand washing. Avoid crowded places,” the statement said.

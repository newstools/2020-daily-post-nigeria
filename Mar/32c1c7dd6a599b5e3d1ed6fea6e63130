Tottenham Hotspur manager, Jose Mourinho, has decided to suspend Spurs’ first-team training until next month at the earliest, according to Football London. The Portuguese also instructed his players to keep on top fitness work at home with individual programmes drafted by the coaching staff. Mourinho made the decision after officials from all 20 English top-flight clubs spoke over a conference call on Thursday and decided that the Premier League, FA Cup, EFL, and Women’s football will continue to be suspended due to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak until April 30 “at the earliest.” DAILY POST recalls that England had earlier this month suspended their domestic football leagues till April 4. Tottenham had been the only London Premier League team still training, as recently as Thursday morning. But with the Premier League announcement that football will not return until the end of April, Mourinho and the club have now adjusted their current plans. Tottenham is currently in the eighth position on the Premier League table. Mourinho’s men have 41 points from 29 matches.

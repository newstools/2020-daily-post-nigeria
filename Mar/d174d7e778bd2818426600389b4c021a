Ekiti State Government will on Monday 30th March, 2020, commence teaching of Primary school pupils on the State-owned radio station, Ekiti FM 91.5 as part of efforts to minimize the effect of school calendar disruption on pupils following the coronavirus outbreak. According to a statement made available to newsmen in Ado Ekiti by the Chairman of the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB), Prof. Francisca Aladejana, the 30-minutes daily programme tagged “school on air” is also designed to positively engage school age children who are on an indefinite break as part of efforts by government to curtail the spread of the deadly coronavirus. The statement explained that primary school pupils would on each weekday be taught one out of English Language, Yoruba, Basic Science, Civic Education and National Value as well as Mathematics. Stressing that the programme would be interactive to facilitate proper appraisal of the impact of the proposed programme, the statement added that there would be a phone-in segment at the end of each edition of the programme which would allow for questions and answers on the topic of the day as well as act as an evaluation for the reach and impact of the programme. It urged parents and guardians to take advantage of the initiative by ensuring that their children actively participate in the programme starting every weekday between 3.10pm and 4.00pm.

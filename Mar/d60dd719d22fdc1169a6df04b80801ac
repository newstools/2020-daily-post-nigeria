Odion Ighalo will accept a £120,000-a-week pay cut, in order to turn his loan deal at Manchester United into a permanent transfer, the UK Sun reports. Ighalo moved to Old Trafford from Shanghai Shenhua on a six-month deal in January. Since his arrival, the Nigerian striker has netted four goals in eight appearances in all competitions. The 30-year-old’s impressive performances have led to calls for United to keep him beyond this season. Ighalo himself is ready to make a financial sacrifice to ensure it happens, as he would be willing to take half of the £240,000-a-week pay he was on in China, in order to complete a transfer move to his boyhood club.

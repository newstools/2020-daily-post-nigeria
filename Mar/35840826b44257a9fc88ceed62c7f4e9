The Chairman, Senate Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters, Opeyemi Bamidele, has explained the approval of $22.7bn loan request by President Muhammadu Buhari. Bamidele, in an interview with newsmen on Monday in Iyin Ekiti, stated that the Senate’s decision was to save the country’s economy from sliding into recession. He said the N10.8 trillion 2020 budgetary provision by the Buhari government was prepared in a way that would avert another economic quagmire. “The step we took was to avert economic recession because to prevent such, the government would have to build infrastructure such as roads, rail lines, create wealth, provide employment and carry out other social services to help the people”, NAN quoted him as saying. “The legislative and the executive arms are working toward the same goal. It is for the development of our nation. ”The planners of the economy knew that our budget must be well funded because we have to keep spending on infrastructure to avert recession. “The 2020 budget estimate of the Federal Government was high and the government must ensure that it is made implementable through proper funding and the loan will help in making the funds available. “The question the people should ask is what are the plans in place for proper spending of the loan? Our people should see it as a welcome development and way to keep our economy soaring.” Noting that criticisms were normal, Bamidele told the people to understand that the loan is well appropriated for the projects that will create wealth and lift the economy. He assured Nigerians that the Senate won’t allow corruption under any guise and will put legislation in place to stop pilfering of the nation’s money.

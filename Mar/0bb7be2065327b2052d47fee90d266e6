Liverpool now needs three wins to be confirmed Premier League champions for the 2019/2020 season. The Reds came from a goal down to defeat Bournemouth 2-1 on Saturday in the early kick-off. Calum Wilson put the Cherries ahead as early as the 9th minute at Anfield. However, Mohammed Salah made it 1-1, before Sadio Mane’s goal completed the comeback. The victory stretched Liverpool’s lead at the top to 25 points. Jurgen Klopp’s men face Everton, Crystal Palace and Manchester City in their next three fixtures.

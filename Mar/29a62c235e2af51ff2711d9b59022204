Liverpool has been handed a significant injury boost ahead of their UEFA Champions League round of 16 second-leg clash with Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night at Anfield. The Reds confirmed this in a post on their official website that captain, Jordan Henderson, has returned to Liverpool’s first-team training at Melwood after recovering from injury. Henderson is now in contention to feature against Atletico Madrid tonight. The midfielder missed Liverpool’s Premier League 2-1 win against Bournemouth last weekend due to a hamstring injury. “Henderson is ready, but what we do with that, I do not know, or maybe I know, and I do not say,” Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp, told a pre-match press conference. Liverpool was defeated 1-0 by Diego Simeone’s men in the Champions League round of 16 first leg encounter last month. Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid has since released their squad to face Liverpool. The match kick-off time is 9 pm.

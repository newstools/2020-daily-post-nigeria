Chelsea forward, Pedro, has admitted that he is going to end his contract with the club amid the spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) across the globe. The Spaniard, who joined Chelsea in 2015, also said that the self-isolation is difficult for him because he could not travel to Spain to see his children. Pedro’s current contract with Chelsea will end this summer, but the 32-year-old believes his time at Stamford Bridge has come to an end. “I’m terminating my contract, but right now, it’s not the most important thing, nor have I stopped to think about it,” Pedro told El Larguero on CADENA SER. “From there on, what has to do with my future will come, but right now, it’s not the most important thing when you don’t even know when you’re going to train again [due to the coronavirus situation].” “The quarantine is a little difficult and hard on everything,” Pedro added. “I have not been able to travel either to see my children. I had a chance to be with them, and I could not travel. “It is a situation that is sometimes uncontrollable because there are no means, no resources.” Meanwhile, the Premier League is presently on suspension until April ending, due to the coronavirus outbreak across the world.

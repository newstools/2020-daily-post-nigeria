Femi Fani-Kayode, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, has reacted to the alleged attempt attack on President Muhammadu Buhari by a young man in Kebbi State. The incident happened at the Argungu International Agricultural show and Cultural Festival in Kebbi State. As Buhari went around the arena, inspecting rice pyramids on display, and taking photographs with farmers, the young man rushed past the security and rushed towards the President but it was not clear what his intentions were. Many who have seen the video, including the former Minister of Aviation, believe the young man was on a mission to attack the President. The Presidency, through the Special Adviser to the President, Femi Adesina, had since debunked the claim of attempted attack rather, insisted that the young man only tried to greet his hero and take a selfie with him. However, this is not the thoughts of Fani-Kayode, who reacting on Twitter, described the incident as an attempted assault on Nigeria’s leader. The former Minister said, “Young man at Argungu today attempting to assault Buhari! That was a close shave. “I don’t know what that young man had in mind but this is the first time that I have ever heard of a citizen wanting to ‘greet’ his President by charging at him. “Must this Government lie about everything? Must they put a spin on every event? Do they think that we are fools? “And by the way, if all he wanted to do was to give ‘his President a handshake’ because he was ‘very excited’ to see him then why to shoot the poor boy in the leg?”   Young man allegedly attempted to attack President Buhari in Kebbi State A post shared by  nwachukwu john owen (@realjohn_owen) on Mar 12, 2020 at 7:42pm PDT

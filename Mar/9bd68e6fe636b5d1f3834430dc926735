Unknown gunmen have attacked Zangang Attakar in Kaura Local Government Area of Kaduna State and allegedly killed one Simon Nim and Tanko Niyio while Assabat Vincent is critically injured. A resident of the area who sought for anonymity told DAILY POST that the suspected herdsmen invaded the community at about 8:am on Wednesday Morning, killing the duo at a spot on their way home from a nearby village. The resident lamented that the Zangang Attakar community has been under constant attack by suspected herdsmen from Ghana Wuri Village in Ryom Local Government Area of Plateau State. The source explained, “It has become a daily routine that our communities are always under attack unabated. “We are calling on the federal government and the state to come to the aid of our communities by establishing a security outpost to put a halt to constant lives lost in the area.” He commended the local government sole administrator for his effort in organizing town hall meetings to discussed banditry issues with Ryom local government chairman to see how attacks on the communities are curtailed. Effort to reach the Council Sole administrator, Dr. Bege Katuka to comment on the issue proved abortive as his lines were switched off Meanwhile, the Police in Kaduna state are yet to make an official statement on the attack.

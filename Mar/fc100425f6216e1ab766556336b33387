The Lagos State Government on Wednesday announced that four children of the same family and their teacher have been quarantined for Coronavirus. All five persons came into Lagos from the United States of America (USA). Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, made the disclosure at a news conference in Alausa, Lagos. He added that another man from the United Kingdom was also under quarantine. Abayomi explained that the four children and their teacher were quarantined because they had contact with a Coronavirus patient. He said the children and teacher were admitted into the isolation centre in Yaba two days ago. The commissioner said the first test had been conducted on them and that they tested negative. He added another test would be conducted within 48 hours for a final confirmation. Abayomi said the man from UK would be tested today to ascertain his status.

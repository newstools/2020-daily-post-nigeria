This is coming as the committee which is preparing to wind up activities claim that it discovered more items allegedly belonging to the State Government in the House of the Former Governor Mohammed Abdullahi Abubakar. A member of the committee Barrister Lawal Husseini Ibrahim stated this in Bauchi Saturday while answering question on the activities of the committee. He said “ as the committee was rounding up its activities it received a whistleblower tip of items being carted away and transferred outside the state by the family of former governor Abubakar, the committee visited the House of the former Governor at Fadaman Mada and was able to recover only few items like 105 Pasta making machines, 10 sewing machines, cartons of surgical hand gloves and several office furniture belonging to the Bauchi Government, the committee had earlier recovered four tractors, a luxury Bus and a House belonging to the state government which the former governor Abubakar sold to himself.

Manchester United striker, Odion Ighalo, has urged the club’s fans to come out en mass and support the Red Devils this weekend when they take on Manchester City in the Premier League derby at Old Trafford. The 30-year-old said this while reacting to his side’s 3-0 win over Derby County in the FA Cup fifth-round on Thursday. Ighalo doubled Man United’s lead after Luke Shaw had volleyed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men in front. The Nigerian striker added one more in the second half after running onto Juan Mata’s pass to ensure Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side qualified for the quarter-final. “I’m happy I scored two goals today, but most especially the team worked hard today, even though we didn’t start the game well,” Man United’s official website quoted Ighalo as saying after the match. “But most importantly, we have qualified for the quarter-finals, so I’m very happy.” Ighalo added: “The fans have been great, not only about today. Since I came here the support, I have been getting from the fans is amazing. “I want to thank them for their support, not only for me but for the team. Even though some games we do not play up to our level, but they are still chanting, cheering us on to victory. “I am very happy, and I thank them, I want them to keep doing that on Sunday against Man City. It’s going to be a massive game, let’s cheer us to victory again.” Man United will now face Norwich City for a place in the FA Cup semis.

Two persons were on Wednesday reportedly killed in the aftermath of the Boko Haram attack in Damboa local government council of Borno State, northeast region of Nigeria. This was confirmed to newsmen by members of the CJTF and local hunters. DAILY POST reports that the local security outfit, who are working alongside the Nigerian Military, also said 20 people were injured, with over 30 gun truck recovered by the military from the insurgents. Musa Abdu, a member of the local hunters, who spoke to Our Correspondent on arrival from Damboa, said they joined the fight while on patrol along the Maidiguri-Damboa road. According to him, they got a call by some of their men in Damboa and joined the military as reinforcement. “So many of the Boko Haram members were killed, but they carried away their corpses. Soldiers, however, are still on the trail of fleeing Boko Haram members when we left Damboa this evening,” he said.

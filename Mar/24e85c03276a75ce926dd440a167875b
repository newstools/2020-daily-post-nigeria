Manchester City manager, Pep Guardiola, has said his side paid for their lack of sharpness in the final third, after they lost 2-0 to Manchester United on Sunday. Although, City dominated possession, they ultimately fell to their seventh defeat of the season. Anthony Martial opened scoring in the first half, finishing off Bruno Fernandes’ clever chip. As Guardiola’s men pressed for a late equalizer, Scott McTominay pounced on Ederson’s poor throw to seal the win. Speaking to Sky Sports after the game, Guardiola said: “It was a good game, we played good. “We missed a little bit in the first half when we were arriving in the final third, we needed to be more aggressive. “We conceded a goal which we should have avoided and after five minutes they have one or two counter-attacks. “The second half was good and it was a good performance.”

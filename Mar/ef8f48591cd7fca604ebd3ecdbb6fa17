Kogi State Government says it has received the approval of the National Assembly to obtain a foreign loan of $100 million (N36 billion). NAN reports that the Commissioner for Information, Kingsley Fanwo, confirmed this to newsmen in Lokoja on Thursday. He said that the loan was to establish a food processing zone and to modernise its agricultural processes. “The request has been approved by the National Assembly. The project is expected to create over two million direct and indirect jobs. “The proposed Kogi Staple Crops Zone and Agricultural Modernisation Project is set to position Kogi State and indeed Nigeria as the food corridor of Africa and an industrial hub,” Fanwo said. Fanwo explained that the loan facility would now be obtained from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and not the World Bank, as earlier announced. “The Kogi State Staple Crops Processing Zone and Agricultural Modernisation Project is aimed at making the state the food corridor of Africa and to also make the nation’s biofuel plan a reality,” he said. He dismissed the reports by a section of the media that the request was “expunged” by the National Assembly. Fanwo stated that it was only removed from the World Bank list and added to the AfDB’s list by the national assembly.

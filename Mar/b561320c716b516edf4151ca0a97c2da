Nasarawa state government has disclosed that advocacy and immediate testing will now take place at motor parks across the state to sensitize travelers on safety steps to prevent the spread of Coronavirus. Mr. Ahmed Yahaya, Commissioner for Health, made this known at a news briefing held at the Nasarawa State Government House in Lafia on Saturday shortly after a stakeholders’ meeting chaired by Governor Abdullahi Sule on measures to prevent the spread of the disease, NAN reports. Yahaya said that the measure would prevent infected travelers coming into the state from spreading the disease to residents of the state. “We are moving to parks and markets to increase sensitization, advocacy and we have ordered necessary gadgets for us to test for coronavirus on-spot travelers and traders so as to ensure the disease does not come to the state,” Yahaya said. This is coming after the Minister of Health, Osagie Ehanire, on Saturday morning said that Nigeria now has ten new cases of coronavirus in Lagos (7) and Abuja (3). The total number of coronavirus cases in Nigeria is now 22. Lagos has 16 cases, Abuja three cases, while Ogun and Ekiti States have two and one cases, respectively. Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has killed nearly 12,755 people globally in 3 months.

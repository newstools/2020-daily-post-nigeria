The Lagos State government has declared two people, who had contact with the country’s index coronavirus case, wanted. The Lagos State Ministry of Health has identified them as Enwelunta Obumnore Godfrey and Salami Abiodun Sadeeq. This was announced by the Commissioner for Health, Prof. Akin Abayomi, on Monday during a briefing. Abayomi also disclosed that suspects who had been in contact with the secondary case of coronavirus, will begin a 14-day isolation process. The secondary case of coronavirus is the individual, who had direct contact with index coronavirus case, the 44-year-old Italian man who is currently being quarantined at an infectious disease facility in Yaba, Lagos State. “The secondary COVID-19 patient has had contact with a few people and those contacts will begin a 14-day isolation process,” he said. The Commissioner also confirmed they were still searching for the remaining two passengers aboard the Turkish Airlines with the Italian coronavirus patient. “Please we need to contact you and you need to be in touch with the Ministry of Health. We have been trying to reach you by the address you put on your forms and by the numbers but none of those numbers are working,” Abayomi added.

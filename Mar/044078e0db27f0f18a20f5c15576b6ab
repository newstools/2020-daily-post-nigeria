The Commissioner of Police in Ogun State, Kenneth Ebrimson has revealed that the major security challenge facing the police in the state is cultism. Ebrimson stated this over the weekend when the Special Adviser to Governor Dapo Abiodun on Students Matters, Azeez Adeyemi, led a delegation of students’ leaders to his office in Eleweran, Abeokuta. The police commissioner expressed worries that cultists were having field days in all the tertiary institutions of learning in the state. DAILY POST gathered that the menace of cultism has extended to secondary schools in Ogun. Likewise, individuals who are not students are also members of various cult groups, terrorising major cities in the Gateway State. Speaking on the matter, the police boss maintained that cultism was threatening the relative peace being enjoyed in Ogun. He explained that the clashes between rival cult groups had on different occasions, affected innocent citizens. According to him, the problem being faced in Ogun is not armed robbery, banditry or kidnapping, but cultism. Ebrimson added that cultism gives birth to armed robbery, kidnapping, drug peddling, saying “it is the major cause of every violent crime in the society.” Speaking, Adeyemi stated that the state government had facilitated the meeting to build cordial relationship between the police and students in Ogun State, urging officers of the force to always see Nigerian students as partners in progress.

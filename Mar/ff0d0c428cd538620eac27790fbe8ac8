Chelsea winger, Willian, has asked the club for permission to return to his native Brazil, so he can be with his family amid the coronavirus outbreak. The 31-year-old’s current deal expires at the end of June, but he has insisted he would be willing to play for the Blues beyond that time. However, his immediate concern is to be reunited with his family, with Willian worried about his wife and daughters. “At the moment, I’m alone. My wife and daughters are in Brazil. “I had made a schedule before that. They went first, I was going to have a break and I was going too. Now, I’m checking here, if I have authorisation from the club,” Willian told Globo SporTV.

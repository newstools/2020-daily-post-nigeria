Anthony Joshua’s promoter, Eddie Hearn, is pushing for a pre-contract agreement, which will see him fight Tyson Fury this year. Although Joshua has been confirmed to face Kubrat Pulev while Deontay Wilder has activated a rematch clause to take on Fury again, Hearn is still keen for the all-British super fight. Joshua and Fury both head into their fights favourites to retain the titles. Hearn has now called for a contract to be signed off before the bouts. “There’s no reason not to get that contracted now, subject to both guys winning in the summer,” Hearn told Sky Sports. “We had numerous conversations with Bob Arum at Top Rank over making Joshua vs Fury. “But we know that once Wilder exercised that rematch clause, that fight would be made. We understand Wilder wants to win his belt back.

President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Monday, called for a constitutional role for traditional rulers as the nation battles insecurity. This was contained in a statement by Isa Mohammed, his Special Assistant on Media, NAN reports. Lawan spoke when a delegation of traditional and political leaders from Taraba State visited his office. The delegation was at the National Assembly to participate in a public hearing on a bill to establish Federal College of Education, Mutum Biyu, Taraba. Lawan said: “There is no way we can succeed in the fight against insurgency or any insecurity without the support and cooperation of traditional rulers. “One thing is obvious, when traditional rulers had the mandate and official responsibility to administer their places before the local government reforms of 1976. “I think our security situation was better because our security architecture included them. “That is not the situation today, and when we face such very profound security situation that we have today, it is time to look at giving traditional rulers more formal responsibilities in the administration of our country. “We need to do that so that we do not need to run to them only when we have issues, they should always be there to support any administration that is in power to administer the country”. Lawan added that the Senate was working hard to come up with ways to thoroughly address the security challenges in Nigeria. He disclosed that Senate had set up a committee chaired by the Senate Leader and that its report would be debated to proffer solutions. Meanwhile, former Sokoto Governor, Attahiru Bafarawa, has called those praising President Muhammadu Buhari “sycophants”. He declared that Buhari administration has failed to provide security for citizens.

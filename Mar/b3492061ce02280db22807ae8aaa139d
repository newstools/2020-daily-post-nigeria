Arsenal captain, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, has said he will still be regarded as a top striker, even if he never wins any trophy. Aubameyang is currently the Premier League’s joint-top goalscorer with 17 goals. The 30-year-old has been linked with a summer exit and clubs like Real Madrid, Barcelona and Inter Milan are interested. Aubameyang will have only one year left on his current deal by the end of the season and is yet to win silverware since joining the Gunners in January 2018. The FA Cup represents this season’s last chance for Aubameyang to win his first trophy in England and he is yet to win a league title in his career, despite spending more than four years at Borussia Dortmund. “I’m a striker so I will defend my side – I don’t think you need trophies to be a top striker. “Of course, it can help you but we’ve seen a lot of great players that didn’t win trophies but we respect them because of their quality. “You don’t need to win trophies but if you win it, it’s better,” he told Soccer Saturday.

Reno Omokri, a former aide to President Goodluck Jonathan on New Media, has described President Muhammadu Buhari’s nationwide broadcast as dishonest, disjointed, and symptomatic of the incompetence and cluelessness of a man who wants to feed school children in this period of coronavirus pandemic. DAILY POST had reported that President Muhammadu Buhari hason Sunday placed 14 days ban on all movements within Abuja and Lagos State. Buhari’s directive is aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 across the country. Speaking during a nationwide broadcast, the president said the directive would take effect from Monday at 11 pm. Reacting, Omokri, in a tweet on his official Twitter page on Sunday night, said President Buhari just told Nigerians lies. He tweeted: “Before General @MBuhari’s broadcast, Nigerians suspected they were on their own. After the ‘live broadcast,’ Nigerians were sure they were on their own. He just read the lies they gave him. No conviction in his voice. What a toy President! “Finally, if I have to describe General @MBuhari’s broadcast, I would say it was dishonest, disjointed, and symptomatic of the incompetence and cluelessness of a man who wants to feed school children while there are no children in schools. #BuhariCoronaAddress #BuhariTormentor.”

Mustapha Salihu, a National Vice Chairman, Northwest of the All Progressives Congress, APC, has reacted to the suspension of Adams Oshiomhole, the party’s National Chairman by a Federal Capital Territory, FCT, High Court. Salihu backed the ruling of the court because Oshiomhole was allegedly on the verge of creating chaos in the party. Addressing reporters shortly after the ruling in Abuja, Salihu claimed that Oshiomhole wanted to foist Arch. Waziri Bulama on the party as APC National Secretary. He alleged that the APC National Chairman was plotting to install Bulama on the National Working Committee, NWC, as its acting head. According to Salihu: “Immediately the court injunction was given, the national chairman called the party’s National Publicity Secretary to issue a statement to the press that Bulama is the Chief Secretary to the Party. “I believe you people (Journalists) are aware of the meeting held about a month ago on that matter, which ended without a decision. Since then, there has not been a decision as to the replacement of the secretary. The chairman is about to create more chaos within the party as he gave the order. “The public should know that any decision that Oshiomhole makes henceforth is an illegal decision and will not hold. “We will keep our fingers crossed until the court decides. I am saying this so that there will not be two national secretaries and there can be no affirmation from a national chairman that has been suspended.” Salihu maintained that Bulama can’t be accepted by party members because he’s not the most senior for the position. “The party cannot accept Bulama, who is the party? The person that should hold that position must be the most senior person in the party,” he said.

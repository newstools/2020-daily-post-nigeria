Reno Omokri, former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan has alleged that one of respirators in Gwagwalada Specialist Hospital has been moved to Aso Rock. Omokri’s claim followed report that President Muhammadu Buhari’s Chief of Staff, Abba Kyari contracted the deadly Coronavirus. The report that Kyari had contracted the disease had led to Nigerians calling for the shut down of the Presidential Villa in Abuja. Following report of Abba Kyari contracting COVID-19, the Presidential Villa was shut down as more people were said to have tested positive. Kyari was in Germany in early March with other Nigerian officials for meetings with Siemens AG. There are fears that the CoS didn’t isolate himself upon his return from Germany. Last week, he led a delegation to Kogi after the death of Governor Yahaya Bello’s mother. However, Omokri in a tweet wrote: “My source (a doctor) revealed that one of only 2 ventilators at Gwagwalada Specialist Hospital, has been ordered moved to an unknown location, suspected to be Aso Rock. I urge Nigerian journalists to go to the hospital to investigate and expose this government!”

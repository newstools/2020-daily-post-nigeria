Chelsea striker, Olivier Giroud, has said manager Frank Lampard promised his more playing time, after his bid to leave in January failed. Giroud, speaking with Telefoot, admitted he did all he could to leave Stamford Bridge in the winter window. The 33-year-old struggled to feature under Lampard, with Tammy Abraham and Michy Batshuayi preferred ahead of him in attack. Giroud was linked with Lazio, Inter Milan and even Tottenham Hotspur. However, the former Arsenal striker ended up staying with the Blues. “On 31 January, I still hoped that I would leave. I was very disappointed, but I’d say that by the following morning, I’d put that behind me. “Then there was the goal against Tottenham and I started playing regularly. That’s how it is now. The coach [Frank Lampard] had promised me more playing time and kept his word, so I simply tried to take my chance.”

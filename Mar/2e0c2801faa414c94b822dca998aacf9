Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta, will be without midfielder Lucas Torreira for their trip to Manchester City in the Premier League on Wednesday. Torreira suffered a broken ankle against Portsmouth in the FA Cup last Monday and missed the 1-0 win over West Ham on Saturday. The Uruguay international has now been ruled out for 10 weeks, the club confirmed today. This means Torreira is unlikely to play again this season. He will be hopeful of regaining full fitness in time for this year’s Copa America. The Gunners could leapfrog rivals Tottenham on the table with a win away at City. The game will also mark Mikel Arteta’s first return to the Etihad, since he left for the Emirates in December.

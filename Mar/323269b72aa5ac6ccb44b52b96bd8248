Chelsea will play Bayern Munich in their Champions League round of 16-second leg behind closed doors. This comes amid several adjustments to sporting events, because of the coronavirus outbreak. The Blues confirmed this in a terse statement posted on their official Twitter page. “Our Champions League Round of 16-second leg away to Bayern Munich next week will take place behind closed doors,” it read. Frank Lampard’s men will be seeking to do the impossible at the Allianz Arena next week. Chelsea trail 3-0 from the first played at Stamford Bridge and would need to win by four goals in Germany, to book their place in the quarter-final.

Kaduna State House of Assembly, on Wednesday, amended the Pension and Gratuity Law 2006 for governors. The law provides for death benefits to any of them who died while in service. The amended benefits will be “lumpsome of gross annual salary of the incumbent Governor or Deputy Governor as a death benefit to the family.” News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that lawmakers unanimously passed the amendment at plenary presided over by the Deputy Speaker, Muktar Hazo, on Wednesday. Suleiman Dabo, representing Zaria constituency, explained why the law was amended. “Looking at the critical roles and responsibilities being carried out by these two individuals, it would be unfair to say that in the event of death, which can happen to either of the two while in office, they will just go like that without anything to their families. “We believe that, in the principal law there is a problem, because it is a human document and there must be an error, as such the amendment was necessary,” Dabo added.

The station was burnt over suspension of Friday congregational prayer by the state government. The police command spokesman, SP Gambo Isah, said one of the rioters also lost his life in the encounter. According to him, some disgruntled youths, under the leadership of one Malam Hassan, conducted Friday prayer in one of the Juma’at mosques in Kusada, in defiance of the directives. “Subsequently, he was arrested for questioning at Area Commander’s office, Malumfashi, which did not go down well with some of his followers. “Consequently, today, March 28, 2020, at about 09:00hrs, this particular group organised themselves in such a tumultuous manner, rioting and attacked police station and over-powered the policemen on duty at Kusada Division. “They set ablaze the police station and DPO’s Quarters,” NAN quoted him as saying. Isah explained that the youth also burnt down seven vehicles and 10 motorcycles. He, however, said normalcy had been restored to the area, and added that the Commissioner of Police, Sanusi Buba, had deployed police patrol teams and Special Joint Security Task Force to beef up security. The police spokesman added that the 90 suspects arrested would be prosecuted after full investigation.

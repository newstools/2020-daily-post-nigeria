A pan South East pressure group, the South East Revival Group (SERG) has described the dismissal of the application filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Emeka Ihedioha, for the review of the Supreme Court judgment declaring Senator Hope Uzodinma the validly elected governor of Imo State, as affirmation of an act of God for the second time. The group, in a statement issued to DAILY POST in Abuja by its President and National Coordinator, Chief Willy Ezugwu hailed the Supreme Court for not ridiculing itself. “At the South East Revival Group, we have always maintained that the verdict of the Supreme Court declaring Senator Hope Uzodinma winner of the March 9, 2019 governorship election in Imo State was an act of God. “For us, the dismissal of the review application filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Emeka Ihedioha is nothing but an affirmation of an act of God for the second time. “Now that the distraction is over, we urge Governor Hope Uzodinma to see his second victory at the apex court as a stamp of divine ordination and use this opportunity to work for the good people of Imo State in particular and the entire South East in general. “We reiterate our strong believe that Governor Uzodinma will outperform all former governors of Imo State at the end of his tenure. “The SERG wishes Governor Hope Uzodinma a fruitful tenure and we urge the governor carry all Imolites along in the running of his administration”, the SERG stated.

Following the challenges of insecurity in Nigeria, former President Olusegun Obasanjo has urged citizens to team up and pray for the country to be better. Obasanjo said Nigerians can’t fold their hands and watch as insecurity ravages the country. He spoke while hosting a special envoy to the archbishop of Canterbury, Archbishop Justin Welby, in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, Wednesday. The former President also stressed that all Nigerians must work and pray to restore unity in the country. He said: “There are so many areas in the world where attentions are needed for peace, equity, and justice. We just cannot as children of God, fold our hands where needs abound for us to do something. “If you Nigeria cannot solve your security problem or unity, how can we look up to you for help, help comes from God and we are looking up to God for help. “We cannot fold our hands, we must work and pray, but I’m a very irredeemable optimist about Nigeria and the world. If we show love, I think all other human problems we can deal with.” This is coming at a time when gunmen suspected to be bandits killed over 30 villagers in Igabi and Giwa Local Government Areas of Kaduna State at the weekend. The affected villages are Kerawa, Rago, Marina, Zariyawa, Hashimawa, Gidan Musa Saidu, and Unguwar Barau. Also, Boko Haram insurgents have been attacking Nigerians in the Northeast. Meanwhile, Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator had blasted Northern leaders for being silent over kidnapping and killings in the region. In a post on his Facebook page on Monday, Sani wrote: “Northern political leaders don’t converge when their subservient followers are being kidnapped or massacred,they converge when their friends or family members are marrying or turbaned or having their birthdays.”

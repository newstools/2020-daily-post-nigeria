Paris Saint-Germain forward, Neymar Jr, has said yes to a move back to Barcelona, according to Sport. Barca failed in a bid to bring back the Brazilian last summer and are expected to try again this year. The main reason is reportedly the fact that Lionel Messi wants to play alongside the Brazilian again. It is understood that Neymar has turned down PSGâ€™s offer of a new contract, which has been on the table since October. The 27-year-old has also communicated to Barcelona via his entourage, that he wants to return to La Liga. Neymar is ready to do whatever it takes to make the transfer happen.

Paul Pogba’s agent, Mino Raiola, has admitted he is eager to take “a big player” to Real Madrid. In an interview with Marca, Raiola once again cast doubt over Pogba’s future at Manchester United. “One day I hope to bring a great champion to Real. At the moment, I have [PSG keeper Alphonse] Areola, but it’s on loan. “This summer I would like to bring a big player to Madrid on a permanent deal. It would be a pride for me and for all my players, because Real are a great side,” he said. It is believed that Real manager, Zinedine Zidane, remains a big fan of his compatriot. There have been suggestions that Pogba could yet remain at Old Trafford, following the arrival of Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon. But Raiola’s latest comments has thrown up the World Cup winner’s future in the air.

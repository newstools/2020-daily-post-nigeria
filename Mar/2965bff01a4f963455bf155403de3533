The National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has declared that the party will bounce back stronger and better. This is despite what the party had gone through in recent times. The former Edo State Governor stated this when be addressed members of the National Working Committee (NWC) which had in attendance members of both pro and anti-Oshiomhole groups on Tuesday. He said the NWC of the ruling party is united. The former Labour leader said, “despite what we have passed through, this NWC is not divided.” He argued that the action and inaction of NWC members were not to destroy the party but for its progress. “I think that God is never wrong, He has allowed what has happened to happen so that we all can learn, everybody re-examine his conscience, strengthen those bonds of friendship, bonds of solidarity and work as a family. “I am the first to admit that I am not the best chairman in the world and I will never be. But no one can fault the sincerity of my purpose. “My style can only be my style. But, I recognise that I must reconcile my style to others so that we can meet in the middle of the road.”

Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, has hailed the “different” qualities of Odion Ighalo, following their 3-0 win over Derby County on Thursday. Ighalo scored twice as United reached the FA Cup quarter-finals. The 30-year-old now has three goals in two starts for the Old Trafford club, since he completed a six-month loan move from Shanghai Shenhua in January. “When you get strikers, you want them to be happy and confident,” Solskjaer told BT Sport. “He has come in here and of course we still have a few injuries and it is great for us to have Odion to call upon. “He is a different striker for us and scores some good goals, there are not many who could dig that one out for his first. We have a team of good players.” Solskjaer will now prepare his team for the visit of rivals, Manchester City in the Premier League on Sunday.

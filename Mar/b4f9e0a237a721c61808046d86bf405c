Gov Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has hinted that the Italian index, who tested positive to the deadly Coronavirus last week has fully recovered. Abiodun said the patient, who is quarantined at the isolation centre in Yaba, Lagos State, would be discharged soon. DAILY POST reports that Gov Abiodun stated this while receiving the management team of Lafarge PLC, led by its Country Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Khaleed El Dokani, in his office at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, Friday. According to a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Kunle Somorin, the Governor informed that his government would continue to regard the virus as a serious threat that deserves special attention, considering the State’s status as the nation’s industrial hub, with large number of expatriates, noting that the State is looking at the possibility of setting up a Bio-security centre. Abiodun said: “For us, the virus is a serious one and an issue that is in the front burner. We will not lower our guard, particularly due to the fact that we have large number of industries and expatriates here. We are enjoying a lot of supports from the World Health Organization and the National Centre for Disease Control. We are going ahead to prepare for the worst and hope for the best,” He applauded the company for its prompt response by quarantining the first index case and the first set of contacts, urging the company to sustain the level of attention given to the issue, just as he added, ”I hear the index patient is doing very well and will be discharged soon”.

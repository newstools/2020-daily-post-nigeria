A secondary school teacher, Azunyere Chima is currently cooling off his heels in the police cell. The police in Ogun State told DAILY POST that the teacher was arrested for allegedly having forceful canal knowledge of a 14-year-old student. The father of the girl had reported the case at the police station on Sunday. DAILY POST learnt that the young teacher made confessional statements after he was arrested, apparently blaming the devil for the act. Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who confirmed the incident in a statement, said the father had reported at Ibafo Divisional Headquarters that his daughter was lured to the house of the suspect, who happened to be her Art teacher, under the pretence that he wanted to help her with a practical work. It was reported that the 23-year-old teacher had dragged the victim into his room, overpowered her and had forceful sex with her. This was said to have caused serious bleeding from the studentâ€™s private part. She has since been taken to hospital for treatment. The DPO Ibafo Police Station, SP Abiodun Ayinde, it was gathered, detailed his detectives to the residence of the suspect at 2, Unity Close Aseese, where he was arrested.

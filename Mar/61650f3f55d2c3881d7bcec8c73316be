The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Oyo state Command, on Tuesday, arrested two students over alleged impersonation during the ongoing Universal Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). The two students were arrested at Sunshine High School, NTC road Ibadan while the examination was ongoing. The suspects are Kamar Segun, 18 years and Omotola Olayinka, 20 years old. DAILY POST gathered that the suspects have been taken to the NSCDC headquarters in Agodi, Ibadan. The two suspects confessed to have planned the impersonation by gaining entrance into the centre but were caught by a security man in the school. Segun and Olayinka thereby pleaded for leniency and promised never to get involved in examination malpractice, impersonation, or any other negative act. NSCDC Commandant in Oyo state, Alhaji Iskilu Akinsanya while parading the suspects, said the command had partnered with Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB, to collectively fight against examination malpractice and any other related matters. Akinsanya called on parents and guardians to always monitor and tutor their children and wards against examinations malpractices. He noted that anybody caught in the act would face the wrath of the law.

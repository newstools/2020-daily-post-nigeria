A 57-year-old man suspected to have been infected with COVID-19 in Damaturu, Yobe State capital has tested negative. Dr. Mohammed Lawan Gana, the State Commissioner for Health, who disclosed this at a press briefing in Damaturu said the male patient, came all the way from California in United States of America 17 days ago. According Dr. Gana the specimen of the suspected case was taken to Abuja but both preliminary and subsequent tests results came back negative, hence allaying the fears of the virus in Damaturu. He noted that the patient has been discharged following certification by medical tests that he is negative to the virus. The commissioner pointed out that the ministry deemed it necessary to hold the press briefing to inform the general public not to panic, maintaining that there is not a case of the virus in Damaturu. He, however, called on residents to maintain basic hygiene both within and outside their immediate environment as part of preventive measures against the virus and other diseases. The commissioner stressed that the state government and development partners operating in the state would continue the training and retraining of health workers on COVID-19 and other epidemic prone diseases.

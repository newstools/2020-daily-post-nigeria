Most Christian residents of Adamawa State kept off their churches on Sunday in obedience to instructions from government and the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN). Both the state government and the state chapter of CAN had asked that Sunday services be suspended as part of measures to avoid large crowds and prevent affliction with coronavirus. Most church branches were entirely under lock and key within the times that Sunday services normally take place. Prominent church locations in the state capital, Yola, which were usually filled with human and vehicular traffics but were completely deserted on Sunday were St Theresa Cathedral, the home church of the Catholic Bishop of Yola, located on Bishop Street, Jimeta; and LCCN Cathedral, the Yola main branch of the Adamawa-based Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria, also located on Jimeta. Many other churches, mostly Pentecostal church branches within Yola were, however, open for what turned out to be skeletal services. Most of them, including the main branch of Living Faith, at Upper Lugere, arranged chairs not exceeding 50, and members who arrived once the seats were filled, were turned back. Many members did not turn up for service, such that only a few had to be turned back in the two services that took place. The first in the main auditorium of the church, and the second at the Youth Chapel. The Dunamis Yola brach, in Bachure, which usually held three services, held just the first service, while the Mountain of Fire & Miracles Ministries, in Jambutu, did not open for service.

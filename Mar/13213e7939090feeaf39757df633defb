The Ogun State Government said it has taken measures to prevent the spread of the deadly Coronavirus by deploying security officials to man the gates of areas accommodating a large number of Chinese nationals. DAILY POST reports that Ogun, for years, has been playing host to Chinese citizens, who are in the state for businesses of choice. It was gathered that the majority of these Chinese travelled to China for the yuletide and have since returned to Nigeria. Speaking on Wednesday, the Special Adviser to Governor Dapo Abiodun on Communications, Remmy Hazzan, said the state government deployed security agents to the areas to ensure effective self-isolation of “returning Chinese nationals.” According to him, the action would stop the possibility of any of them manifesting coronavirus symptoms without being noticed by the concerned authorities. Hazzan said the Chinese nationals are in quarries, some in farms, adding that “the estate in Ogun-Quandong Free Trade Zone, Igbesa, is 100 per cent Chinese.” “These nationals are isolated in these places. As a matter of fact, we have security officials manning the entrances to all these places to forestall any breach. “We also have people running errands for them (Chinese) to forestall the likelihood of anyone trying to go into neighbouring towns,” he stated. Meanwhile, the state government has put on hold preparations for its annual African Drums Festival. Government said the festival is suspended for now because of Coronavirus as the event involves bringing in foreigners from other African countries.

The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State has expressed sadness over Saturday’s explosion of a dynamite-laden truck on the Akure-Owo highway. Recall that the explosion had destroyed a church, school and some houses while cutting the highway into two. Reacting, APC in a statement signed by Mr Alex Kalejaiye, the state Publicity Secretary, commiserated with the victims of the explosion. “The party’s sympathy goes to the victims of the deadly circumstance, the state government and entire people of the state.” Kalejaiye commended the quick response of the government and the security agencies in allaying the fears of residents and for seeking alternative route to the damaged portion of the ever-busy Akure-Owo road. While wishing those injured speedy recovery, APC called on companies and individuals to be more circumspect in taking precautions when moving items that were capable of unleashing devastating consequences on people, when handled carelessly.

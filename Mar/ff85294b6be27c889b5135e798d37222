The House of Representatives says it plans to amend the National Youth Service Corps, NYSC Act to provide for willing corps members to be employed as teachers after completion of service. Gbajabiamila revealed thos development at the ongoing ‘Special plenary for out of school children in Nigeria’. In his remark, he said, “We have come here to consider the matter of the millions of children in our country who are out of school and who as a result are denied their fundamental right to receive the training and skills acquisition opportunities that will allow them have better lives than their parents before them and provide a better future for their offspring. “I will seek legislation to amend the National Youth Service act to allow the Corps to establish a “Teaching for Nigeria ” pathway which will allow for the identification, recruitment and deployment of willing, capable and promising young Nigerians to serve as teachers in underserved areas during their service year and for a number of years after. “This will also be in exchange for a Federal Government commitment to fund their post-graduate education in addition to whatever allowances they might receive during their deployment”

The Imo Diaspora Coalition for Justice and Democracy, IDCJD, has told the Supreme Court to sack Senator Hope Uzodinma as the State Governor and restore Hon. Emeka Ihedioha. This was contained in a letter addressed to the Supreme Court justices ahead of the ruling on the review application on Monday. In the letter made available to reporters, the group said Ihedioha’s mandate should be restored alongside the integrity of the judiciary. The group further told the Supreme Court that it was “the last line of defence for preserving the integrity of Nigeria’s judiciary, sanctity of the ballot, the fledgling democracy and averting anarchy in the country.” The letter added, “May God give you the courage to remain the bastion of justice for the common man. “Do hearken to the supplication of Ndi Imo for the restoration of he who shares their values and whom they voted for- Emeka Ihedioha.” The apex court will on Monday hear and make pronouncements on the application filed by Emeka Ihedioha and his party, the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. In the application, they want the court to set aside its earlier judgement of January 14 that sacked Ihedioha and pronounced Uzodinma as the authentic Governor of the State.

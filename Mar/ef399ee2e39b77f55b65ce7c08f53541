Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has claimed that they have the worst injury list, ahead of this weekend’s Premier League clash against Everton. Lampard, speaking to the media on Friday, revealed that Christian Pulisic was lacking match fitness, despite taking part in an in-house game along with Ruben Loftus-Cheek on Friday. Pulisic has not featured for the Blues since January 1. “We had an in-house game [on Friday] which Christian [Pulisic] and [Ruben] Loftus-Cheek played. “I just watched it and they are trying to find match fitness. It’s great to see Christian get some minutes but he’s still short of match fitness,” Lampard said. When asked if Abraham would return before the end of March, Lampard replied: “I hope so, he’s not training with us yet. “Hudson-Odoi had another injury and is having a scan later today. It’s tough for him. He wasn’t rushed back. He did it training back with us. “It’s another injury for us. We have had the worst injury list. We are working. “Kovacic is not fit and we will have to assess Willian, who is a question mark for the weekend.”

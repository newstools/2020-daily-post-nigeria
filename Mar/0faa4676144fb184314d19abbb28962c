Former Liverpool striker, Michael Owen, has predicted Thursday’s UEFA Europa League last 16 first-leg tie between LASK and Manchester United. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s men will take on the Austrian side at the Linzer Stadion. The Red Devils defeated Manchester City 2-0 in their last Premier League derby on Sunday. Providing his prediction, Owen wrote on his Betvictor column: “United won this competition back in 2017, of course, and have looked very convincing so far this year. “On top of that, they are coming off the back of a derby win over Manchester City at the weekend so confidence will be high. “LASK does carry strong domestic form into the tie, but I see them being overwhelmed by their opponents on the night.” The match kick-off time is at 6:55 pm.

A prophet and pastor of Rhema Deliverance Ministry in Anambra State, Prophet Ejike Nwachukwu has revealed that he told former governor of Abia State and the senator representing Abia North that he would end up in prison. Prophet Nwachukwu who spoke on the second day of an on-going four-day crusade at Rhema Deliverance Ministry in Awka said he had told the senator of the ordeal that awaits him, but he (Kalu) simply brushed it aside and said that can not happen in Nigeria. He said, “The Holy Spirit is not man, and whatever he reveals comes to pass. It is the same way that I told Orji Uzor Kalu that he was going to be jailed and he stopped taking my calls. “He told me it is not possible for him to go to jail in Nigeria. I told him what he should do to avoid going to prison, but he ignored it, and today, where is he?” He asked rhetorically. The preacher said that the instructions he gave to Kalu still stands, and that if he heeds his instruction and does the things he asked him to do, he will get out of prison seamlessly. He said, “But my instruction to him still stands. If he does what I told him to do, he will be released.” Nwachukwu also revealed that the recent fire incident in Abule Ado in Lagos was not an ordinary pipeline explosion as it was branded. “The fire explosion that happened in Abule Ado was not ordinary. It was to happen in Onitsha and right on that Sunday, I told my congregation while I was preaching that something was about to happen in Onitsha. “I stopped my preaching and ordered the congregation to pray for Onitsha. That explosion was to happen in Onitsha, and it was not pipeline explosion but man made disaster. We were still in that service when we heard stories of the explosion in Lagos, and I knew that it had happened. “There is nothing the Lord can not do and he has shown so many times over, and we must trust in his power to protect us,” Nwachukwu said.

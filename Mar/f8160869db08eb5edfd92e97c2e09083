The Nigerian Air Traffic Controllers Association (NACTA) has lamented the condition of aviation equipment and facilities across the country. The body urged the government to provide more funds for the completion of critical aviation safety projects nationwide. National President of NACTA, Mr Abayomi Agoro told NAN on Saturday that funds were needed to speed up advancing runway lighting system. He also called for improvement of power supply system to meet up Cat III Instrument Landing System (ILS) operations, among others. “Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) should simplify and expedite Performance Based Navigation (PBN) and Cat III Instrument Landing System (ILS) operation authorisation for airlines and pilots. “Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA) should establish a reliable communication network infrastructure that will solve the perennial communication problem. “As a matter of fact, the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) should intensify efforts at upgrading visual aids to meet the requirement for Cat III Instrument Landing System (ILS) operations,” he said. The workers advised FAAN to restore runway lights on RWY 18L for night operations and work on putting back central taxiway (Taxiway Bravo) in Lagos to service.

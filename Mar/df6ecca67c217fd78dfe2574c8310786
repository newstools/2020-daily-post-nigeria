Manchester United legend, Rio Ferdinand, has chosen who is a better defender between Liverpool’s Virgil van Dijk and former Red Devils centre-back, Nemanja Vidic. According to Ferdinand, Vidic is a better defender compared to Van Dijk, adding that he would instead prefer to partner with the former Serbian international than the Holland international. He, however, admitted that he loves Van Dijk, but Vidic covered his back during their time together at Old Trafford. When asked who he would pick between Van Dijk and Vidic, Ferdinand said as quoted by Goal: “I’ve got to go with Vidic because he was my partner, man. “He was my partner. He covered my back, and I covered his. That was it.” “I love Van Dijk, don’t get me wrong. “I love him, and I think he’s the best defender in the world now. “I would love to have seen him play in our time to see what he was. “That would have been interesting because he is a top player.” Ferdinand retired from football before Van Dijk joined Premier League side, Southampton, in 2015.
